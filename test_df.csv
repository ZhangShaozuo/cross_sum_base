"In a keynote speech, Mr Carney said a rate rise ""could happen sooner than markets currently expect"". The consensus among economists was that rates would rise in the first half of next year, or even earlier. BBC economics editor Robert Peston said that although the comments point to an increase this year, any rise ""will be small and gradual"". Mr Carney was speaking in London on Thursday at the annual Mansion House dinner attended by City and business grandees. 'Gradual' He acknowledged there was ""already great speculation about the exact timing of the first rate hike"" from their record low of 0.5%, adding that the decision was ""becoming more balanced"". Mr Carney emphasised that there was ""no pre-set course"" on when to raise rates. There was more spare capacity in the economy that would need to be used up first, he said. And he also reiterated that the timing of the first rise was less important than the speed at which subsequent increases were made. ""We expect that eventual increases in Bank rate will be gradual and limited,"" he said. Speaking at the Mansion House just before Mr Carney, Chancellor George Osborne confirmed plans to give the Bank new powers to prevent the housing market from overheating. These will include capping the size of mortgage loans compared to income or the value of the house. The new powers would be given to the Bank's Financial Policy Committee by the end of this Parliament, Mr Osborne said. He said: ""We saw from the last crisis the dangerous temptations for politicians to leave the punch bowl where it is and keep the party going on for too long. ""I want to make sure that the Bank of England has all the weapons it needs to guard against risks in the housing market. ""I want to protect those who own homes, protect those who aspire to own a home, and protect the millions who suffer when boom turns to bust."" Too much risk Mr Osborne also announced reforms to planning laws designed to increase the supply of housing. These should provide permission for up to 200,000 new homes, the government says. The chancellor said the housing market did not pose an immediate threat to financial stability, but that if left unchecked, it may do so in the future. He said the risks come from homeowners borrowing too much to pay for their houses. This is a problem not just for the borrowers, but for the banks that lend them the money, he said. There are concerns that when interest rates rise from their current record lows, many homeowners could struggle with their mortgage repayments. Earlier on Thursday, Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was ""appalled"" that some banks had been lending five times a mortgage applicant's income, suggesting a ""stable level"" was up to 3.5 times. Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics found prices rising at an annual rate of 17% in London, compared with 8% in the UK as a whole. This has led to fears that an unsustainable bubble is developing in the housing market. However, last week the Nationwide Building Society said it had seen signs that house price rises were starting to cool, while the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said momentum in the housing market was beginning to slow. Analysis: Jonty Bloom, BBC Business Correspondent Mark Carney was headhunted from Canada to be the Governor of the Bank of England. That is why his speeches are occasionally enlivened with obscure references to ice hockey, moose or, as in Thursday's speech, a rather strained metaphor linking central banking to canoeing. But it was a much less colourful line in the speech that grabbed the headlines. The first rate hike ""could happen sooner than markets currently expect"", he said. Let me translate from Canadian. Everyone has been betting interest rates won't rise this year. They are wrong. Until Thursday the consensus was that rates would stay at 0.5% for until at least the beginning of next year and possibly longer. But the economy is now growing far more strongly than predicted, and that means the Bank is thinking about when to raise rates and calm things down.",英国央行行长马克·卡尼周四（12日）晚间暗示，英格兰银行的基准利率今年可能上调。,英国央行行长卡尼暗示，英格兰银行的基准利率今年可能上调。 卡尼说，提高利率的时间可能会比市场目前的预期要早，但是上调的幅度将会很小，会是一个逐渐增长的过程。 经济学家的共识是，英格兰银行的基准利率会在明年上半年上调，或者更早一些。 在周四晚间伦敦金融城市长官邸年度晚宴上发表讲话时，卡尼承认，对于什么时候提高利率已经出现很多推测，并称上调的决定现在正在变得“更加合适”。 他强调说，央行没有预先设定何时上调利率的时间，还重申，首次上调利率的时间不像如何渐进提高利率的速度那么重要。 卡尼说：“我们预计，真正到了提高利率的时候，将会是逐渐增加和有限度的上调。” 对房市的影响 英格兰银行的基准利率维持在历史低点的0.5%已经持续了5年，去年卡尼曾表示，当英国的失业率下降到7%时，将考虑提高利率。 但是有担心认为，从目前的历史超低点上提高利率，可能会影响英国的房地产市场，并增加房主偿还房贷的负担。 在卡尼讲话之前，英国财相奥斯本也在周四的伦敦金融城市长官邸年度晚宴上发表重要讲话，提到英国的房地产市场。 奥斯本在讲话中证实，准备给予央行新的权力，以防止房地产市场过热。 这些预防措施中包括严格按照收入和房产的价值，来限制房贷借款的数量。 奥斯本说，虽然目前迅速高涨的房价并没有对英国经济的稳定构成直接威胁，但是如果任其发展，将来就可能造成危害。 奥斯本指出，危险来自房主为买房而过度借贷，这一风险不仅危及房主，也危及借给他们房贷的银行。 （编译：嵇伟 责编：尚清）
"By Juliana LiuHong Kong correspondent, BBC News When I was three years old, after months of begging, my parents finally gave in to my pleas for a puppy. The day that my uncle, a lorry driver, brought me a fuzzy yellow mongrel from my grandmother's mountainous, faraway home was the happiest of my young life. I named him ""Doggie"", and we immediately became inseparable. As an only child born in 1979 at the beginning of China's one-child policy, I had always been alone, and Doggie became my best friend. He loved running around outside our one-room flat, gobbling up left-over rice and snuggling near the coal fire. But these halcyon days did not last. After just one winter, my parents told me Doggie had to go. In Chinese cities in the early 1980s owning a pet was considered highly undesirable, bourgeois behaviour. None of my neighbours had one. It was also not entirely legal. There was no access to animal vaccines or vets, so pets could pose a public health risk. One day, my mother announced we were going shopping - and when we returned a few hours later Doggie was no more. He had been strung up by the legs in our communal yard, and was soon turned into a stew, complete with herbs and hard-boiled eggs. No-one paid any attention to my tears. I heard the neighbours say I would soon forget the whole thing. They, on the other hand, were in a celebratory mood. In the years before China's economic boom, when some food was still rationed, it was rare to have the chance to feast on a whole animal. I refused to eat the stew - and I have never eaten dog in my life. In China, the tradition of dog-eating goes back far beyond written history. Along with pigs, oxen, goats, horses and fowl, dogs are one of the six animals domesticated during the Stone Age. On the other hand, it is not the kind of thing that is eaten every day. It is a speciality meat, commonly believed to confer strength, vigour and virility on the eater. How dog is eaten Chinese food expert Fuchsia Dunlop writes: Judging by the sporadic waves of outrage about dog-eating in China, you might think it was one of the pillars of the Chinese diet. Actually, however, the consumption of dog meat is extremely marginal: it's seldom seen in markets and on restaurant menus, and most Chinese people eat it rarely, if at all. Dogs, like pigs, have been reared for their meat in China since the Neolithic age, but in modern times their flesh is regarded as a delicacy in just a few areas, such as Hunan and Guizhou. Even in these places, it tends to be eaten only occasionally, and in certain seasons. According to traditional Chinese medicine, dog is a ""heating"" meat which can offer a useful energy boost in midwinter, but is best avoided after the lunar new year. In culinary terms, dog meat is normally blanched or soaked before cooking to dispel the earthier, heavier aspects of its flavour. It is then, typically, made into slow-cooked soups and stews seasoned with ginger, spring onion, rice wine and spices, although it may also be roasted, or served cold as an appetiser. The tender meat of puppies is favoured over that of older dogs. In the course of many years of studying Chinese cuisine, I've only eaten dog meat on a handful of occasions. The first time, it reminded me of pork; the second, in a fiendishly spicy Hunanese stew, it recalled the taste of lamb. About 716 million pigs are slaughtered in the country every year, and 48 million cattle. The number of dogs slaughtered is far lower - one animal rights group puts the figure at about 10 million. But where do these dogs come from? According to some researchers, many are pets - like Doggie, except they have been stolen from their owners. As dogs were arriving for the dog-meat festival at Yulin in Guangxi province this week, Peter Li of Humane Society International saw no animals with quarantine inspection certificates to indicate they had been farmed. ""All of them can be suspected to be stolen urban pets, rural guard dogs and stray dogs and cats,"" he says. A four-year inquiry into the dog-meat industry by Animals Asia also concluded that most dogs eaten in China are stolen. ""During the entire investigation, we found no evidence of any large-scale breeding facilities, where 100-plus dogs were bred and raised,"" says the report published earlier this month. ""The difficulty of large-scale breeding of dogs for food and the greed for profit give rise to stealing, snatching from the streets and even poisoning of dogs."" But Li says there is mounting pressure on Chinese authorities to take action against the eating of pets - and that society is turning against the idea of eating dog altogether. There were far fewer stalls selling dog and cat meat at the Yulin festival this year than in 2014, he says. ""The overall attitude is against dog eating. China has 130 million dogs, of which 27 million are urban pets. That's a big number of pet owners. ""The younger generation, born in the 1990s, is not tolerant of animal cruelty."" In 2014, animal rights activists intercepted 18 lorries carrying dogs intended for eating, resulting in the rescue of some 8,000 animals, he says. The Chinese media often carries stories of such rescues, in which activists force vehicles to stop and pool money to purchase the animals. He dates the rise of animal protection activism in China to 2011, the same year when, for the first time ever, more people lived in cities than the countryside. City dwellers, he says, view dogs and cats more as pets, rather than as working animals - guard dogs, for example - or sources of meat. In May, on a visit to Shanghai, I saw a sight that delighted me. While strolling on the Bund, I stopped a young tourist named Yang Yang who was carrying her tiny, fox-like dog in a sling on her chest, the way I normally carry my human baby. ""Oh, this way I can take him into restaurants and on airplanes,"" she explained. ""Otherwise, he wouldn't be allowed in with me. Where I go, he goes."" All three of us posed for a photo in front of Shanghai's iconic skyline. How I wish more people had taken this attitude three decades ago. My parents, now utterly embarrassed about having allowed my pet to be cooked, generally avoid the topic entirely. But when I was five years old, my father left China to study abroad and the very first gift he sent me was a fuzzy, yellowish stuffed puppy. I named him Doggie. To this day, wherever I go, he is with me.

"The Australian actress married Cruise in 1990 after they starred together in the film Days Of Thunder. She said: ""I got married very young, but it definitely wasn't power for me - it was protection. ""I married for love, but being married to an extremely powerful man kept me from being sexually harassed."" The couple divorced in 2001. Speaking about Hollywood's harassment scandal, Kidman said: ""Of course I've had MeToo moments - since I was little! But do I want to expose them in an article? No. Do they come out in my work? Absolutely."" Kidman and Cruise, who during their marriage adopted two children, Isabella, now 25, and son Connor, now 23, divorced in 2001. Kidman said her separation from Cruise forced her to ""grow up"". She wrote: ""I would work, but I was still very much cocooned. So when I came out of it at 32, 33, it's almost like I had to grow up."" Kidman married country music singer Keith Urban in 2006. The couple have two daughters together: Sunday, 10, and Faith, seven. The Oscar-winning star's films include Moulin Rouge!, The Hours, Lion, The Others and Dead Calm. Separately, Sir Michael Caine has also spoken out about the Weinstein scandal. Sir Michael, who has worked with Harvey Weinstein three times, told the Radio Times that Hollywood is a safer place following the allegations made against the producer. The actor said: ""There is one great thing, if it can be described like that, about Harvey and his behaviour. It's that actresses are safe now. No producer would dare to do anything sexually.""

"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The iPhone X - which is referred to as ""ten"" - uses a facial recognition system to recognise its owner rather than a fingerprint-based one. Apple said FaceID can work in the dark by using 30,000 infra-red dots to check an identity, and was harder to fool than its old TouchID system. It is Apple's most expensive phone yet. A 64 gigabyte capacity model will cost $999 (£999 in the UK) when it goes on sale on 3 November. A 256GB version will be priced at $1,149 (£1,149 in the UK). By contrast, Samsung is charging $930 (£869 in the UK) for its new Note 8 phone, which has 64GB of storage. ""The iPhone X is a long-term investment by Apple that sets a template for the next generation of iPhone hardware,"" commented Geoff Blaber from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""An OLED [organic light-emitting diode] display and the new design is likely to be standard on future iPhone models, but Apple must first tackle the challenge of obtaining sufficient supplies."" Apple said the switch to an OLED display would help the phone produce ""true blacks"" and more accurate colours than before. LG and Samsung already use similar tech on their handsets. Prior to the launch, Apple's most expensive phone was an iPhone 7 Plus that cost $969 (£919 in the UK). One expert commented that Apple's ability to get consumers to spend more on its smartphones than rivals' was ""legendary"". ""There may be an element of high pricing to constrain demand and make things match up with how many they can produce,"" said Neil Mawston from Strategy Analytics. ""But I suspect Apple always had a $1,000 iPhone in mind - we had seen the price creep up year after year, and there's a lot of pressure from shareholders for the company to hit a $1tn valuation. ""Bumping up the prices on their number one product is one way of doing that."" Facial recognition Apple acknowledged that users might have concerns about using facial recognition to verify purchases via Apple Pay or to access their device. But it claimed that while there was a one-in-50,000 chance that TouchID could be unlocked by a random stranger, the odds rose to one-in-one-million with FaceID. Nevertheless, one expert said users might still be concerned the handset had no fingerprint sensor as an alternative. ""This is the steepest hurdle that they have,"" commented Carolina Milanesi from market research firm Creative Strategies. ""A lot of consumers will be a little bit reluctant to use facial recognition as an ID system until Apple has proven that it is safe and works all the time. ""In the eyes of consumers TouchID wasn't broken - so they may ask why Apple is trying to fix it."" Other features announced about the handset included: Analysis By Dave Lee, North America technology correspondent It's the big(ger) leap that iPhone fans - and Wall Street - had been demanding. The iPhone X brings together many features we'd been expecting - such as FaceID for unlocking the phone, and animated emojis - animojis - that look fun to play with, if not a killer feature that will have people running to stores. All this won't come cheap: at $999+ it's the most expensive iPhone to date. Apple is often accused of being slow to new tech, and I think that criticism will continue. Wireless charging comes years after Samsung first introduced it, for example, and the overall look of the phone - which no longer has the iconic home button - looks strikingly similar to the latest Samsung Galaxy Note. The phone was unveiled in the new Steve Jobs Theater, a purpose-built venue for such launches. A beautiful, comfy building, with marble everywhere, it sits alongside Apple's striking new spaceship campus. This is the house that iPhone built, with a decade of phenomenal success. Does iPhone X herald another great era? The audience here cheered, but didn't stand, with applause. I'm reserving my judgement until I've tried it. The iPhone X also adds support for wireless charging. ""Apple chose Qi wireless charging,"" noted Ian Fogg, from the IHS Markit consultancy. ""It was the right decision to use a standard because Apple users will benefit from widely available charge pads."" The feature was also introduced to the new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models, which were introduced earlier at the event. The lower-end 4.7in and 5.5in devices are distinguished from their predecessors by having: The iPhone 8 ranges from $699 to $849 and the iPhone 8 Plus from $799 to $949. They will cost the same amounts in Sterling and go on sale on 22 September. Mixed reality The new models coincide with the release of iOS 11 - the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. It introduces ARKit - software development tools that make it easier for developers to add augmented reality features to their apps, in which graphics are mixed together with real-world views. Marketing chief Phil Schiller showed off one app that - if used by spectators at a sports stadium - would show real-time stats hovering over the live action. Another demo involved the Machines, a multiplayer robot-battle game that can be played over views of close-by table tops and other surfaces. The facility will not work on the iPhone 6 or older devices, so may provide a means to convince owners of ageing Apple kit to upgrade. ""When Apple first introduced the iPhone users were unsure about how touchscreens would benefit them, but now we know that they're a great way to use a device,"" said Brian Blau, a tech industry analyst at Gartner. ""The same thing will happen with augmented reality - it's as important as touch, if not more. ""Developers have new opportunities and I think they will embrace them, but just as with touch it took them years to perfect those experiences, I also think that will also happen with AR."" Apple also unveiled a version of its smartwatch with its own 4G link. The innovation means that the Watch Series 3 can receive phone calls, access internet services and stream music without being linked to an iPhone. Users will, however, face an additional monthly charge for the benefit. Apple recently overtook Fitbit to become the world's joint-top wearable tech-maker alongside Xiaomi, according to one study. Other companies - including LG and Samsung - have previously sold smartwatches with in-built cellular capabilities, but battery-life restrictions and other issues limited interest. ""Apple's ability in the past to generate new markets when others thought they were dead is legendary,"" commented Mr Mawston. ""For people like joggers, runners and cyclists who possibly want to do hardcore sports outdoors without carrying two devices, an LTE Apple Watch could be something of a blessing."" The latest version of the Watch's operating system - which will also be available to earlier models - will include new heart monitor functions. It will warn owners if their heart rate becomes elevated when they are not active or if its rhythm becomes irregular, to flag the possibility of disease. The 4G Apple Watch will cost $399 (£300) and be released on 22 September. 4K movies Apple also announced a fresh version of its TV set-top box, which now supports 4K video and high dynamic range (HDR) content. In one of the few details not to have leaked in advance, Apple revealed it had struck a deal with several of the major movie studios to ensure that films in the higher-resolution, richer-colour formats would not cost more than their high-definition (HD) equivalents. Users' existing iTunes movie libraries will also be upgraded without charge. HDR 4K movies have already been available to rent or buy from services including Amazon, but they tended to be sold at much higher prices than lower-quality formats.",苹果（Apple）发布了最新型号的高端智能手机，采用了没有主屏幕按键（Home键）的全面屏。,WATCH: Apple's event in two minutes iPhone X（正确名称是“十”）采用面部识别系统判断用家身份，而不是以往的指纹识别。 苹果表示，Face ID使用30000个红外线打点来识别身份，比旧有的Touch ID系统更难以出错。 这是苹果迄今为止售价最贵的一款手机。 在11月3日发售时，64G存储容量的机型将售999美元（在英国则售999英镑），256G的版本售价则是1149美元（在英国售1149英镑）。 相比之下，三星的新款Note 8手机则售930美元（在英国售869英镑），存储容量64G。 “iPhone X是苹果的一项长期投资，为下一代的iPhone硬件定下模板，”咨询公司CCS Insight的杰夫·布拉波（Geoff Blaber）说。 “OLED（有机发光二极体）显示屏和新的设计很可能成为未来iPhone机型的标准，但是苹果必须首先面对维持充足供应的挑战。” 苹果表示，转向OLED显示将会帮助苹果制造出“真正的黑色”以及比以往更精准的色差。LG和三星已经在他们的手机设备上使用了类似的技术。 在iPhone X发布前，苹果最贵的手机是iPhone 7 Plus，售价969美元（在英国售919英镑）。 一名专家评价说，在令消费者花费更多的钱买它而不是竞争对手的手机这方面，苹果的能力的是“现象级”的。 数据分析机构策略分析（Strategy Analytics）的尼尔·莫斯顿（Neil Mawston）说：“或许是高价格的因素在控制着需求量，使之与他们所能生产的数量相对应。” “不过我怀疑，苹果一直以来都有卖1000美元iPhone的想法——我们看到它的售价在逐年地悄悄上升，股东们也施加着很多压力，要让该公司的估值达到1万亿美元。” “将他们的头号拳头产品价格抬高是做到这一点的其中一种方法。” 面部识别 苹果承认，用家对于使用面部识别来进行Apple Pay支付或者打开应用程式等动作，或许会有一点担忧。 但是苹果声称，虽然机率只有5万分之一，但是指纹识别仍然有可能被一个随机的陌生人打开，而在面部识别系统中，这个机率就下降到了100万分之一。 苹果表示，已运用多种技术保证Face ID系统的准确运作 不过，有专家表示，这款手机没有指纹识别作为替代选项，可能仍然会令用家担忧。 “这是他们面对的最大障碍，”市场调查机构创意策略（Creative Strategies）的卡罗莱娜·米兰内西（Carolina Milanesi）说。 “直到苹果证明它在任何时候都安全可用之前，很多的消费者会有一点不愿意使用面部识别作为身份认证系统。” “在消费者眼里，Touch ID并没有问题——他们可能会问苹果为什么要改。” iPhone X的其他新元素： 分析－BBC驻北美科技记者戴夫·李（Dave Lee） 这是“果粉”和华尔街都在要求的一次大飞跃。 iPhone X将很多我们一直期待的元素集合在了一起——比如et Face ID解锁手机，还有看起来很好玩的动画表情，哪怕它未必是那种会让人奔向商店的决定性功能。 所有这些玩意儿并不便宜：999美元起，是目前为止最贵的iPhone。 苹果经常被指在新技术应用上走得较慢，而我认为这种批评还会继续出现。 比如，无线充电就是在三星首次推出之后好些年才用上，还有这款手机的整体外观——不再有标志性的主屏幕键——看起来与三星Galaxy Note的最新型号出奇地想像。 iPhone X通过面部映像捕捉，让用家控制动画图像的表情 这款手机是在新的史蒂夫·乔布斯厅（Steve Jobs Theater）发布的，这是一个特定为此类发布而建的场馆。 一幢美丽舒适的大楼，四周都是大理石，就坐落在苹果令人震撼的“太空船式”新总部旁边。这座建筑就是在iPhone十年来取得现象级成功的基础上建起来的。 iPhone X会预示着另一个伟大的时代吗？这里的观众有欢呼，有掌声，但是没有起立。在我真正试用之前，我仍然暂时不作判断。 iPhone X还加入了支持无线充电的功能。 “苹果使用了‘Qi’的无线充电标准，”咨询公司IHS Markit的伊恩·福格（Ian Fogg）说。 “使用同一个标准是一个正确的决定，因为苹果用家将能够从很多款充电枕当中选择。” 这一功能也加入到了新的iPhone 8和iPhone 8 Plus机型当中，两款新手机也在发布会上推出。 iPhone 8机型也达到了防尘防水 这两款稍低端的4.7寸和5.5寸手机与前代的不同包括： iPhone 8的价格在699美元至849美元之间，而iPhone 8 Plus则是799至949美元之间。 它们在英国的售价也将是同等数额的英镑，并于9月22日发售。 混合虚拟现实 新款手机与最新版本的苹果移动设备操作系统iOS 11的发布同期推出。 它还引入了扩增现实（AR）的软件开发工具ARKit，令开发者更容易将AR元素加入应用程序，虚拟图形能够与现实世界的视像混合。 苹果的市场营销总管菲尔·席勒（Phil Schiller）展示了一个应用程序，当观众在体育场馆内使用时，将会在现场实况画面上显示实时的数据。 另一个试用版则是Machines，这是一个多人玩的机器人战争游戏，可以在附近的桌面或者其他平面的图像上进行。 这些功能将不能在iPhone 6或者更旧版本的手机上使用，所以也成为了用家更换旧手机的理由。 “苹果第一次推出iPhone的时候，用家并不确定到底触摸屏会带来什么好处，但现在，我们都知道这是使用设备的一种绝佳方式，”科技产业分析家布莱恩·布劳（Brian Blau）说。 “同样的事情将会在扩增现实当中发生——它是和触摸屏同样重要，甚至更重要。” “开发者有了新的机会，而我认为他们将会尽情拥抱这些机会，但就像他们花了几年才令触摸屏的体验完善起来一样，我认为AR也会一样。” 苹果还推出了智能手表的新版本，它拥有自己的4G连接。 新的苹果手表有了一个红色的表冠，以突显它的4G功能 这一革新意味着，新款的Watch Series 3不需要连接iPhone就能接听电话，上网和播放音乐。不过，用家将需要为此另外支付每月的费用。 一项研究显示，苹果最近取代了Fitbit成为世界上两大可穿戴设备生产商之一，另一家是小米。 其他公司，包括LG和三星在内，此前均出售过有内置蜂窝网络的智能手表，但电池寿命的限制以及其他问题，令消费者对这些产品兴趣寥寥。 “苹果过去在所有人都认为无望的时候创建新市场方面的能力享负盛名，”莫斯顿说。 “对于像慢跑、长跑和骑行者等可能希望在户外进行运动而不需要带两个设备的人来说，一个有LTE网络的苹果手表或许是一种福音。” 最新版的苹果手表操作系统（对于前几代同样适用）将包括新的心跳监测功能。 它会在非运动状态下心跳加速时提醒用家，或者在心跳节奏不规律时发出警告，以告知患病的可能。 4G Apple Watch的售价将是399美元（300英镑），并于9月22日出售。 发布会在苹果新总部的史蒂夫·乔布斯厅举行 4K电影 苹果还宣布推出一个新版本的电视机顶盒，将支持4K视频和HDR（高动态范围成像）素材。 少数几个预先透露的细节之一是苹果与几大电影公司达成协议，保证更高精度、更丰富色彩的电影收费不会高于高清（HD）电影。 此前，消费者要为4K HDR电影支付高昂费用 目前的iTunes电影用家也将会免费升级。 HDR 4K电影在亚马逊（Amazon）等服务平台上已经可供租售，但是它们的价格往往远高于低精度格式的视频。
"Has North Korea got the bomb? Technically yes - North Korea has conducted several tests with nuclear bombs. However, in order to launch a nuclear attack on its neighbours, it needs to be able to make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on to a missile. While North Korea claims it has successfully ""miniaturised"" nuclear warheads, international experts have long cast doubt on these claims. Yet according to information leaked to the Washington Post in August 2017, US intelligence officials now do believe North Korea is capable of miniaturisation. How powerful are North Korea's nuclear bombs? North Korea says it has conducted five successful nuclear tests: in 2006, 2009, 2013 and in January and September 2016. The yield of the bombs appears to have increased. September 2016's test has indicated a device with an explosive yield of between 10 and 30 kilotonnes - which, if confirmed, would make it the North's strongest nuclear test ever. The other big question is whether the devices being tested are atomic bombs, or hydrogen bombs, which are more powerful. H-bombs use fusion - the merging of atoms - to unleash massive amounts of energy, whereas atomic bombs use nuclear fission, or the splitting of atoms. The 2006, 2009 and 2013 tests were all atomic bomb tests. North Korea claimed that its January 2016 test was of a hydrogen bomb. But experts cast doubt on the claim given the size of the explosion registered. Plutonium or uranium? Another question is what the starting material for the nuclear tests is. Analysts believe the first two tests used plutonium, but whether the North used plutonium or uranium as the starting material for the 2013 test is unclear. A successful uranium test would mark a significant leap forward in North Korea's nuclear programme. The North's plutonium stocks are finite, but if it could enrich uranium it could build up a nuclear stockpile. Plutonium enrichment also has to happen in large, easy-to-spot facilities, whereas uranium enrichment can more easily be carried out in secrecy. Can North Korea deliver it? There is no consensus on exactly where North Korea is in terms of miniaturising a nuclear device so that it can be delivered via a missile. According to that information leaked to the Washington Post, US intelligence officials now believe North Korea's claim that it has the technology to fit its missiles with nuclear warheads. Japan's defence ministry has also recently stated this is a possibility. The new assessment comes only weeks after North Korea tested what it said was an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the US mainland. While analysts doubt Pyongyang's claim, most experts agree the missile could reach Alaska or Hawaii. What else do we know about the North's nuclear programme? A site in the mountains near Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, is thought to be the North's main nuclear facility, while the January and September 2016 tests were said to have been carried out at the Punggye-ri site. The Yongbyon site processes spent fuel from power stations and has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. Both the US and South Korea have also said that they believe the North has additional sites linked to a uranium-enrichment programme. The country has plentiful reserves of uranium ore. What has the global community done about this? The US, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea engaged the North in multiple rounds of negotiations known as six-party talks. There were various attempts to agree disarmament deals with North Korea, but none of this has ultimately deterred Pyongyang. In 2005, North Korea agreed to a landmark deal to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for economic aid and political concessions. In 2008, it destroyed the cooling tower at Yongbyon as part of the disarmament-for-aid deal. But implementing the deal proved difficult and talks stalled in 2009. The US never believed Pyongyang was fully disclosing all of its nuclear facilities - a suspicion bolstered when North Korea unveiled a uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon, purportedly for electricity generation, to US scientist Siegfried Hecker in 2010. In 2012, North Korea suddenly announced it would suspend nuclear activities and place a moratorium on missile tests in exchange for US food aid. But this came to nothing when Pyongyang tried to launch a rocket in April that year. In March 2013, after a war of words with the US and with new UN sanctions over the North's third nuclear test, Pyongyang vowed to restart all facilities at Yongbyon. By 2015, normal operations there appeared to have resumed. The 2016 tests brought international condemnation, including from China - the North's main trading partner, and only ally. In 2017, the UN agreed a new sanctions package in response to the tests. In August, US President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with ""fire and fury"" should the country not abandon its threats against the US. The rhetoric from Washington failed, though, to rein in Pyongyang which in turn said it was developing a strike plan to hit the US territory of Guam, an island in the Western Pacific.",朝鲜核计划成了国际社会一大头痛。各种努力一齐尝试，朝鲜还是搞了五次试爆。,"韩国军方称，朝鲜2月12日发射一枚弹道导弹。这是美国总统特朗普上台以来朝鲜首度相关测试。 那么，金家的核武器到底开发到什么程度了呢？ 朝鲜有核弹吗？ 技术上说，有。朝鲜已经做过几次核弹试验。但是，要对邻国发动核攻击，朝鲜需要能制造出足够小的核弹头装在导弹上。 朝鲜宣称已经成功把核弹头""微型化""，但是这从来没有独立证实，一些专家对朝鲜的说法表示怀疑。 朝鲜核弹多厉害？ 朝鲜说已经成功做过五次核试验：2006、2009、2013、2016年1月和2016年9月。爆炸威力似乎有所增强。 2016年9月的那次核试验显示出当量应在10-30千吨之间，如果获证实，这将成为朝鲜史上威力最大的一次核试验。 另外一个大问题是，朝鲜测试的是原子弹还氢弹，氢弹威力更大。 更多阅读：新闻背景：氢弹和原子弹有什么不同 朝鲜叛逃外交官：金正恩会对美国发动核攻击 特写：金正恩到底搞的是什么名堂？ 2006、2009和2013的试爆都是原子弹。朝鲜宣称2016年1月的那次是氢弹。但是，考虑到监测出的爆炸强度，专家对此表示怀疑。 第五次试验的详情还未披露。 钚还是铀？ 再有一个问题：朝鲜核试验用的核燃料是什么。 专家认为，前两次试验用的是钚，但不清楚2013年那次用的是钚还是铀。 成功的铀弹试验将标志着朝鲜核武器发展迈出重大一步。朝鲜钚存货是有限的，但是如果可以浓缩铀，那么朝鲜就可以建立起自己的核库存。 浓缩钚需要在大型、容易监测到的地点展开，但是浓缩铀可以更容易地在秘密地点做。 朝鲜能发射核弹吗？ 关于朝鲜核弹头""微型化""做到哪种程度，目前还没有共识。 2016年3月，五角大楼发言人库克（Peter Cook）说，美国还没有看到证据表明朝鲜有能力做到弹头微型化。两天后，负责保卫美国领空的戈特尼（Adam Bill Gortney）将军告诉参议院，尽管情报部门认为""成功可能性很小""，但是，假设平壤能够袭击美国才是""慎重""之举。 斯坦福大学赫克（Siegfried S Hecker）教授是研究朝鲜武器开发的专家。他在2016年9月写道，平壤离发射装有核弹头、可以抵达美国领土的洲际弹道导弹的能力""还有相当长的距离—也许5到10年，但是如果（朝鲜核计划）不受限制的话，是可能做得到的。"" 关于朝鲜核计划我们还知道些什么？ 据信，朝鲜主要核设施位于平壤北部宁边附近山区，2016年1月和9月据信是在丰溪里试验基地展开的。 美国和韩国都表示，朝鲜另外还有浓缩铀项目基地。朝鲜铀矿储藏丰富。 朝鲜核谈也是谈谈停停 国际社会作了些什么？ 美国、俄国、中国、日本和韩国与朝鲜展开多次会谈，多次试图达成禁核协议，但迄今未能阻止平壤。 2005年，朝鲜签署里程碑式协议、同意放弃开发核武器换取经济援助和政治让步。2008年，朝鲜甚至拆毁宁边冷却塔。但是，推行协议很困难，2009年陷入停滞僵局。 美国从来不相信平壤全面公开了核设施情况。朝鲜2010年向美国的赫克教授公开了宁边浓缩铀设施，美国的疑心有了更多证据。 2012年，朝鲜突然宣布暂停核开发活动、暂停导弹试射以换取美国粮食援助。但是同年4月，平壤就尝试发射新型导弹。 2013年3月，朝鲜第三次核试验后美国加紧制裁，平壤誓言重新启动宁边所有核设施。到2015年，宁边看似恢复正常运作。 中国有什么表态？ 国际社会密切关注中国对朝鲜各次试射的反应。中国是朝鲜主要贸易伙伴、也是朝鲜唯一的盟友。 更多阅读 分析：朝鲜局势升级 中国显得""无计可施""？ 2016年朝鲜第五次、也是当量最大的一次核试射引起普遍谴责，国际社会加强制裁。 中国也谴责了朝鲜，但是外交部发言人同时强调，朝鲜半岛相关各方的安全关切应该、而且只能以符合各方利益的方式加以解决，任何仅从自身利益出发采取的单方面行动都是""死胡同""。 北京通常很谨慎，不愿意采取哪些能让朝鲜这个动荡的邻居更加不稳定的举措。 不过也有观察人士认为，中国对朝鲜的影响越来越小，金正恩也越来也不听中国的话。"
"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Diabetes - or uncontrolled blood sugar levels - is normally split into type 1 and type 2. But researchers in Sweden and Finland think the more complicated picture they have uncovered will usher in an era of personalised medicine for diabetes. Experts said the study was a herald of the future of diabetes care but changes to treatment would not be immediate. Diabetes affects about one in 11 adults worldwide and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation. Type 1 diabetes is a disease of the immune system, which affects around 10% of people with the condition in the UK. It errantly attacks the body's insulin factories (beta-cells) so there is not enough of the hormone to control blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes is largely seen as a disease of poor lifestyle as body fat can affect the way the insulin works. The study, by Lund University Diabetes Centre in Sweden and the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, looked at 14,775 patients including a detailed analysis of their blood. The results, published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, showed the patients could be separated into five distinct clusters. Prof Leif Groop, one of the researchers, told the BBC: ""This is extremely important, we're taking a real step towards precision medicine. ""In the ideal scenario, this is applied at diagnosis and we target treatment better."" The three severe forms could be treated more aggressively than the two milder ones, he said. Cluster 2 patients would currently be classified as type 2 as they do not have an autoimmune disease. However, the study suggests their disease is probably caused by a defect in their beta-cells rather than being too fat. And perhaps their treatment should more closely mirror patients who are currently classed as type 1. Cluster 2 had a higher risk of blindness while cluster 3 had the greatest risk of kidney disease, so some clusters may benefit from enhanced screening. Better classification Dr Victoria Salem, a consultant and clinical scientist at Imperial College London, said most specialists knew that type 1 and type 2 was ""not a terribly accurate classification system"". She told the BBC: ""This is definitely the future of how we think about diabetes as a disease."" But she cautioned the study would not change practice today. The study was only on Scandinavians and the risk of diabetes varies considerably around the world, such as the increased risk in South Asians. Dr Salem said: ""There is still a massively unknown quantity - it may well be that worldwide there are 500 subgroups depending on genetic and local environment effects. ""Their analysis has five clusters, but that may grow."" Sudhesh Kumar, a professor of medicine at Warwick Medical School, said: ""Clearly this is only the first step. ""We also need to know if treating these groups differently would produce better outcomes."" Dr Emily Burns, from Diabetes UK, said understanding the diseases could help ""personalise treatments and potentially reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications in the future"". She added: ""This research takes a promising step toward breaking down type 2 diabetes in more detail, but we still need to know more about these subtypes before we can understand what this means for people living with the condition."" Follow James on Twitter",瑞典和芬兰的科研人员说，人们常说的糖尿病实际是一种非常复杂的疾病，它可以分成5种不同的疾病。,"糖尿病可能有5种或更多类型。 这一最新研究结果也许可以为未来针对每一种形式来研究治疗方案铺路。 传统上讲，人们把糖尿病分成两种：一型糖尿病和二型糖尿病。 总的说来，糖尿病是由于患者体内的血糖无法得到控制造成的。 现在，瑞典和芬兰的研究人员认为糖尿病远比人们所了解的要复杂。 他们希望这一发现可以开启未来糖尿病个体治疗方案的新时代。 当然，糖尿病治疗方法不会立即出现变化。 从全球来看，每11个人中就会有1人受糖尿病影响。糖尿病会增加心脏病、中风、失明、肾衰竭以及截肢的风险。 传统类型 糖尿病病情复杂 如何区分一型和二型糖尿病？ 一型糖尿病主要是免疫系统的疾病。患者的免疫系统攻击生产胰岛素的β细胞 (beta-cells)，因此使患病者自身无法产生足够的荷尔蒙来控制血糖。 一型糖尿病通常是从小就发病。个别也有成年后才发病的。英国首相特里莎·梅据说属于一型糖尿病。 二型糖尿病主要与生活方式有关，比如肥胖。因为过多的脂肪影响胰岛素的功能。 但如果家族里有糖尿病和高血压病史的，即使体重正常也可能患上二型糖尿病。 瑞典和芬兰的研究人员详细分析了14775患者的血样标本。他们的研究结果被发表在权威杂志《柳叶刀糖尿病与分泌学》上。 五大类别 他们把糖尿病划分为五大不同组别。 二型糖尿病主要与生活方式有关，比如肥胖。 研究人员对BBC表示，这一发现非常重要，因为这朝着未来精确治疗又迈进了一步，特别是针对前3组更严重的糖尿病与后2组轻微些的糖尿病应该采取不同的治疗。 组别2的糖尿病目前被划分在二型糖尿病中，因为患者并没有自身免疫性疾病。 而且，研究发现这类病人有可能是由他们的β细胞缺陷引起的，并不是因为肥胖。 对这类病人的治疗应该更接近一型糖尿病的治疗方法。 组别2的糖尿病患者失明的风险更高，而组别3的患者肾衰竭的风险最高。 更精确分类 锻炼有助减少肥胖和疾病 伦敦帝国理工学院的萨勒姆博士说，大多数的专家其实都知道泛泛地把糖尿病分成一型和二型""不是特别准确""。 然而，她表示该项研究是基于斯堪的纳维亚半岛居民（Scandinavians）的研究结果，而从全球来看糖尿病风险的区别可能非常大。 萨勒姆博士说，""我们对糖尿病的了解仍然非常少。从世界范围来看很可能可以再分为500种不同次组别，这一切都取决于基因和当地环境因素的影响。"" 英国华威大学医学院的库马教授说，""很明显这仅仅是第一步""。 他说，""我们需要知道根据不同组别采用不同治疗方案是否将会产生更好疗效。"" 英国糖尿病慈善机构的彭斯博士表示，希望对糖尿病更深入的了解对未来个体化治疗，以及减少糖尿病并发症风险有所帮助。 当然，她表示还需要进行更进一步的研究，特别是二型糖尿病可以再细分为各种分类型（subtypes)，只有这样才能更好地了解糖尿病患者的状况和生活，以便将来能出台更好的治疗方案。 中国状况 过去几年，全球糖尿病人数呈显著上升趋势，而中国则起了""助燃剂""的作用。 过去20年中，中国糖尿病患者人数增加了56%。 美国的同期增长是71%，仍处于领先地位，沙特阿拉伯增长60%，墨西哥增长52%。 据悉，每10万人中，中国的糖尿病患者是6480人，几乎赶上美国的6630人。 一项研究显示，随着中国、墨西哥等发展中国家肥胖人数增多，全球糖尿病患者在过去20年中增加近一半。 过去几十年中，糖尿病患者人数在发达国家一直呈上升趋势。这主要归咎于肥胖症人数的增多。 但研究也显示，一些发展中国家也在出现这样的模式。 这个趋势在中国、墨西哥和印度等国尤为明显。"
"Most respondents said they thought NI would still be part of the UK in 10 years time, but not in 25 years. In NI, 49% of people said if there was a border poll today they would vote to remain in the UK, with 43% backing a united Ireland and 8% undecided. The poll was commissioned by BBC NI's Spotlight programme. In the Republic of Ireland, where a vote would have to be held in parallel with any border poll in Northern Ireland, 51% said they would vote for a United Ireland, 27% would vote for Northern Ireland to stay in the UK and 22% were not sure. When asked if they thought NI woud be part of the UK in 10 years, 55% in NI and 59% in the Republic of Ireland said they thought it would be. But when asked if this would be the case in 25 years, 51% of people in NI and 54% in the Republic said NI would have left the UK. The poll also suggested that only 40% of people in Northern Ireland saw its formation 100 years ago as a cause for celebration. Most people on both sides of the Irish border believed there was a potential for a return to political violence in Northern Ireland, according to the poll. The poll was carried out over the Easter period when clashes were taking place in a number of areas across Northern Ireland, sparked by loyalist anger over the Northern Ireland trade protocol and the Police Service of Northern Ireland's handling of a republican funeral during the pandemic. Of those surveyed in Northern Ireland, 76% agreed with the proposition that ""the dispute over Northern Ireland's status remains unresolved and there is still a potential for violence in the future"". In the Republic, an even higher proportion, 87%, echoed that view. A total of 48% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland told the pollsters they want the controversial trade protocol introduced as part of the UK's EU Withdrawal Agreement scrapped, in line with demands from the DUP and other unionist parties, while 46% wanted the protocol to be retained. Unionists have claimed the protocol, which requires checks on goods moving across the Irish Sea from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, threatens the constitutional integrity of the UK. Interviewed for the Spotlight programme, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin insisted the protocol was not tearing the UK apart, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was working to ""sandpaper"" away what he described as the ""ludicrous barriers"" to trade across the Irish Sea. In the Republic, a majority of those surveyed supported the Irish government's defence of the trade protocol, with 74% saying it should not be scrapped. Although within Northern Ireland a larger number of people rejected the trade protocol than backed it, the poll also provided an indication that a majority wants to retain some form of economic link with the EU. Some 56% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland told the pollsters that they wanted their assembly members (MLAs) to vote to stay within the EU Single Market when the matter is put to a vote at Stormont in three years' time. Only 38% indicated they wanted to leave the EU Single Market. In Northern Ireland 37% of people surveyed told the pollsters they would like to see a border poll within the next five years, whilst a further 29% want it to happen at some point after that. However the prime minister told the Spotlight programme that he cannot see any Northern Ireland secretary considering a border poll for a ""very, very long time to come"". The prime minister told BBC Northern Ireland that as ""a proud unionist"" he views the centenary of Northern Ireland's formation as a cause for celebration. However only 40% of the people surveyed agreed with the proposition that ""the formation of Northern Ireland 100 years ago was an achievement which should be celebrated"", while 45% disagreed with the statement. Outright celebration of the centenary turned out to be the least popular of five options included in the survey. In Northern Ireland, 48% agreed that the partition of Ireland and the creation of a land border 100 years ago was ""a negative development which should be regretted"". A total of 50% wanted to concentrate on current challenges such as the Covid pandemic rather than the centenary, whilst 61% backed marking Northern Ireland's formation in a neutral manner acknowledging the differing opinions on the subject. The same proportion, 61%, agreed with the statement ""Northern Ireland's history is not just about constitutional politics and the centenary should provide an opportunity to showcase its sporting, business, scientific and cultural achievements"". In the Republic, celebrating the formation of Northern Ireland was even more unpopular with just 12% agreeing with the proposition. The most popular options were marking this year's centenary in a neutral manner, which was favoured by 74% of those surveyed and regretting partition - a view 71% agreed with. The poll commissioned by BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme was carried out by the NI Pollsters LucidTalk and the Irish polling firm Ireland Thinks. The margin of error is +/- 2.5%. The results from a number of other questions in the survey regarding what should happen to the Irish flag, national anthem, the Stormont Executive and the health service in the event of a United Ireland will be released on BBC Northern Ireland's political programme The View on Thursday night.

"Chinese exporters into the US - including Suntech - will now face customs tariffs of between 2.9% and 4.73%, the Commerce Department said. In 2011, imports of solar cells from China into the US were valued at $3.1bn (£1.96bn), it added. The price of solar panels dropped more than 30% last year, mainly linked to cheaper panels made in China. ""Countervailable subsidies are financial assistance from foreign governments that benefit the production of goods from foreign companies,"" the Commerce Department said. China's Suntech, the world's largest producer of solar panels, will now face duties of 2.9% to offset what the US said is its subsidy from the Chinese government. Another firm, Changzhou Trina Solar Energy, will receive duties of 4.73%. All others face duties of 3.61%. US customs will collect deposits equivalent to these amounts now and the Commerce Department will make a final ruling in June. The US will also rule on whether China's solar panel output is violating its anti-dumping rules on 17 May. Chinese firms have said that they are not the only ones that receive government help - for example, the US has subsidies to encourage people to install solar panels. China has already said it will launch its own investigation into US government support for renewable energy.",美国商务部决定将对中国产太阳能板增收关税，美方称中国当局对生产商提供了不正当的补贴。,预计2020年全球太阳能电池市场规模将达到700亿美元。 美国商务部周二（20日）说，初步调查显示，中国太阳能板也就是光伏企业的产品得到政府2.9%至4.73%的非法补贴，因此美国将对进口的中国太阳能板征收相同比例的惩罚性费用。 尽管新增关税水平不高，但专家表示此举会导致中美贸易关系紧张。 中国光伏产品 据悉，美国还在就太阳能板和太阳能电池的倾销指控进行调查，美国商务部预计将在6月就报复性关税作出最终决定。 德国Solar World美国子公司联合其他六家生产商在去年10月向美国商务部正式提出针对中国光伏产品的反倾销和反补贴调查申请。11月被美正式立案。 后来，美国国际贸易委员会宣布中国光伏产品对美相关产业造成损害，该案正式进入美商务部调查阶段。 中国商务部此前针对美国际贸易委员会就太阳能板的初裁时表示，美方没有充分证据，不顾中方抗辩，初裁不符事实，凸显贸易保护主义倾向。 中国媒体说，中国大型太阳能板生产商均否认在美国倾销太阳能板，也否认接受不正当的政府补贴。 中国产钢丝 美国商务部周二还宣布，将对来自中国和墨西哥的镀锌钢丝征收反倾销关税，以应对两国不公平定价和政府补贴的做法。 美国商务部对墨西哥和中国的钢丝分别征收最高达38%和235%的反倾销关税。 此外，还对中国钢丝设立19%至223%的反补贴税。美国国际贸易委员会将对这一决定进行投票，结果将于五月初揭晓。 去年，美国从中国进口了总值约为5800万美元的钢丝。
"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent The 25-year-old needed hospital treatment after his lungs could not get enough oxygen into his body. Reinfections remain rare and he has now recovered. But the study in the Lancet Infectious Diseases raises questions about how much immunity can be built up to the virus. The man from Nevada had no known health problems or immune defects that would make him particularly vulnerable to Covid. What happened when Scientists say the patient caught coronavirus twice, rather than the original infection becoming dormant and then bouncing back. A comparison of the genetic codes of the virus taken during each bout of symptoms showed they were too distinct to be caused by the same infection. ""Our findings signal that a previous infection may not necessarily protect against future infection,"" said Dr Mark Pandori, from the University of Nevada. ""The possibility of reinfections could have significant implications for our understanding of Covid-19 immunity."" He said even people who have recovered should continue to follow guidelines around social distancing, face masks and hand washing. Scientists are still grappling with the thorny issue of coronavirus and immunity. Does everyone become immune? Even people with very mild symptoms? How long does any protection last? These are important questions for understanding how the virus will affect us long-term and may have implications for vaccines and ideas such as herd immunity. So far, reinfection seems to be rare - there have been only a few examples out of more than 37 million confirmed cases. Reports in Hong Kong, Belgium and the Netherlands said they were no more serious than the first. One in Ecuador mirrored the US case in being more severe, but did not need hospital treatment. However, it is still early into the pandemic, and the history of other types of coronavirus means protection is expected to wane. As countries endure a second wave of the virus, we may start to get clearer answers. It had been assumed that a second round of Covid would be milder, as the body would have learned to fight the virus the first time around. It is still unclear why the Nevada patient became more severely ill the second time. One idea is he may have been exposed to a bigger initial dose of the virus. It also remains possible that the initial immune response made the second infection worse. This has been documented with diseases like dengue fever, where antibodies made in response to one strain of dengue virus cause problems if infected by another strain. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said the study was ""very concerning"" because of the small gap between the two infections, and the severity of the second. ""Given the fact that to date over 37 million people have had the infection, we would have expected to have heard of many more incidents if such very early reinfections with severe illness were common. ""It is too early to say for certain what the implications of these findings are for any immunisation programme. But these findings reinforce the point that we still do not know enough about the immune response to this infection."" Follow James on Twitter",美国一名男子两次感染新冠病毒，其医生称，第二次感染情况更危险。,. 这名25岁男子的肺部供氧不足，因此需要住院治疗。二次感染很少见，他已康复。但发表在《柳叶刀》传染病专刊中的研究提出一个疑问，人体可以对这种病毒产生多少免疫力？ 这位来自内华达州的男子没有已知这使健康问题或免疫缺陷，也就是说，他不属于特别容易受新冠病毒侵害人群。 感染时间线 新冠肺炎如何影响我们的身体 科学家认为患者是再次感染冠状病毒，而不是最初的感染休眠后反弹。科学家分析比对两次症状发作期的病毒遗传密码后发现，二者区别太大，无法由同一感染引起。 美国内华达大学的马克·潘多里博士（Mark Pandori）说：“我们的研究发现以前的感染不一定能保证将来不再感染。再次感染的可能性也许会对我们对新冠免疫力的理解产生重大影响。” 第一支新冠疫苗何时上市？ 他说即使已经康复的人也应继续遵循社交疏离，戴口罩和洗手的相关指引和准则。 科学家仍在努力解答有关新冠病毒和免疫等棘手问题。每个人都会对病毒免疫吗？甚至症状很轻的人也会？人体的免疫保护能持续多久？ 这些问题有助于了解新冠病毒将怎样长期影响我们，并可能对疫苗和群体免疫等观点产生影响。 目前为止二次感染的案例似乎很少见：3700多万例确诊病例中，只有少数病例是二次感染。 香港，比利时和荷兰的报道说，他们的症状并不比第一次感染严重。厄瓜多尔的一名患者与美国患者的情况类似，二次感染症状更为严重，但不需医院治疗。 但这仍是新冠大流行早期，其他类型冠状病毒的历史意味着免疫保护预计会降低。 随着各国开始忍受第二波疫情，我们可能会得到更明确的答案。 有人认为第二轮新冠疫情会比较温和，因为人体在第一波疫情期间学会对抗这种病毒。尚不清楚这位内华达州患者为何第二次病情会加重。有种说法是他可能暴露在更大量的病毒中。 最初的免疫反应也有可能使第二次感染更为严重。这已在登革热等疾病中得到证明。体内产生抗体的登革热病人又被另一种登革病毒株感染， 问题就来了。 英国东英吉利大学的保罗·亨特教授（Paul Hunter）说，这项研究“非常令人担忧”，因为两次感染之间的时间差很短，并且第二次感染症状更严重。 “迄今为止，全球已经有3700多万人感染新冠，如果这种早期的二次感染症状更严重的情况很普遍，我们本该听说更多案例。现在评估这些发现对任何免疫接种计划的意义还为时过早。但这些发现进一步证明我们对感染新冠病毒后的免疫反应还知之甚少。” 2020年的8月，香港曾出现全球首例二次感染病例。但与上文提及的美国案例不同，香港二次感染患者的第二次症状表现比第一次感染时轻微。 彼时研究者认为，二次感染意味着新冠肺炎无终身免疫，患者可能会在康复后再度感染，群体免疫的措施也可能无用。
"Mr Cameron's spokesman has said ""nothing is off the table"" when it comes to talks between the pair. Earlier, the prime minister told MPs he would raise the issue of subsidised Chinese steel with his counterpart. Human rights and cyber attacks are also likely to be discussed. The visit comes after Chancellor George Osborne visited China last month, where he said it was the government's intention to make the UK China's ""best partner in the west"". Mr Osborne also announced earlier this month that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants - a move questioned by some. Mr Cameron told Chinese state TV Mr Xi's visit marks a ""very important moment"". The Communist leader and his wife Peng Liyuan arrived at Heathrow Airport, where they were greeted on behalf of the Queen by Viscount Hood. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond joined the welcome party. Large red flags of the People's Republic of China are lining The Mall in central London, along with the union jack, in preparation for the official welcome on Horse Guards Parade on Tuesday. During their visit they will meet members of the Royal Family and stay at Buckingham Palace, visit businesses and address members of the Houses of Parliament at Westminster. Amnesty International and other groups concerned with human rights issues in China are expected to protest in St James' Park on Tuesday and it is expected that there will also be a pro-China protest. Steel concerns The start of the visit comes as parts of Caparo steel were put into administration - with unions saying cheap steel from abroad may be a cause. Concerns have already been raised about the impact of cheap steel from China on the European market. Shadow business secretary Angela Eagle said earlier that ""anti-competitive dumping... is driving down steel prices."" Mr Cameron told the Commons: ""We're doing everything we can in Europe to help our steel industry. ""That is why we voted in favour of dumping tariffs against the Chinese and we'll do everything we can to help our steel industry, including looking at how we help on high energy usage and the clearances that we need with that. ""Will we raise it with the Chinese? Of course, we'll raise all these issues. That is what our relationship with China is all about."" Who is China's President Xi? Mr Cameron's spokeswoman also said she expected human rights and the threat faced from cyber attacks to come up during talks. Developing a strong and engaged relationship ""means we are able to talk to them... frankly and with mutual respect,"" she added. China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said on Sunday that his country does not ""shy away"" from discussing human rights. Mr Liu said he doubted Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would raise human rights abuses during a state banquet at Buckingham Palace this week after Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he would use the visit to discuss the issue. Meanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge has recorded a speech on the illegal ivory trade for Chinese state TV. He also raised the issue with Mr Xi when they met in Beijing earlier this year and his broadcast will form part of a series of programmes called Let's Talk. Also ahead of Mr Xi's visit, former defence secretary Liam Fox questioned the deal with China over nuclear power. Dr Fox said he would be happier if ""central elements"" of software were produced in the UK. Asked if he was happy with the arrangement, Dr Fox said: ""I think we have to question it."" China state visit: The timetable Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday",中国外交部长王毅星期三（6月10日）在伦敦发表谈话说，中国国家主席习近平今年10月对英国的国事访问将为中英两国关系的“黄金时代”拉开序幕。,哈蒙德和王毅星期三（6月10日）对媒体发表了谈话 习近平将在访问期间下榻白金汉宫，这被看成是伦敦和北京之间逐步改善关系的最新发展。 英国首相卡梅伦曾在2012年会见西藏流亡精神领袖达赖喇嘛，使两国关系陷入低谷。 此外，英中两国也就英国前殖民地香港出现的抗议示威发生争执。 中国外交部长王毅星期三结束了对伦敦历时三天的访问，在当天同英国外交大臣哈蒙德举行了第二轮会谈。 王毅在会谈后发表讲话说，“在双方共同努力下，两国关系克服了一些困难和障碍，发展势头良好，日趋成熟稳定。” 他还说，“卡梅伦首相曾表示英国愿成为中国在西方社会最有力的支持者，我们对此表示赞赏。” 王毅说，中国愿意呼应英国希望开创中英关系“黄金时代”的积极意愿，并且希望习近平对英国的访问为这个“黄金时代”拉开序幕。 “进一步的动力” 哈蒙德说，习近平对英国的访问将为两国关系的成长和深化注入进一步的动力。 中国领导人上一次对英国的国事访问是2005年中国国家主席胡锦涛对英国的访问。 英国女王伊丽莎白二世和丈夫菲利普亲王在1986年对中国进行了国事访问，也是他们唯一一次访问中国。 英国首相卡梅伦和其他政府官员在2013年访问了北京。 英国第二王位继承人、女王长孙威廉王子曾在今年3月访问中国，并在访华期间会见中国国家主席习近平，被外界认为是两国改善关系的又一个迹象。 按照计划，中国国家主席习近平在今年10月访英期间除了在白金汉宫下榻之外，还将访问英国议会，并将会见英国首相卡梅伦。 （编译：跃生 责编：路西）
"Mr Bezos is buying the paper and its other print properties in a personal capacity. The Post has been owned by the Graham family for 80 years. ""Years of familiar newspaper-industry challenges made us wonder if there might be another owner who would be better for the Post,"" said Post chief executive, Donald Graham. ""Jeff Bezos' proven technology and business genius, his long-term approach and his personal decency make him a uniquely good new owner for the Post."" The Washington Post Company also owns Kaplan, a test preparation company, in addition to other properties. Those will stay under the ownership of the Grahams as part of a yet-unnamed entity. The sale is expected to be completed in the next 60 days. Declining circulation The flagship paper, known for its coverage of the Watergate scandal, has suffered in recent years as the internet has hurt advertisement sales and it has struggled to adapt its print coverage to the web. Journalist Carl Bernstein, who, along with Robert Woodward, broke the Watergate story in the 1970s, said he had high hopes the announcement would ""represent a great moment in the history of a great institution"". He added that it showed ""recognition that a new kind of entrepreneurship and leadership, fashioned in the age of the new technology, is needed to lead not just The Post, but perhaps the news business itself"". ""Jeff Bezos seems to me exactly the kind of inventive and innovative choice needed to bring about a recommitment to great journalism on the scale many of us have been hoping for, while employing all the applicable tools and best sensibilities of a new era and the old,"" he said. The Post has been ""declining in circulation especially among young readers,"" Horizon Media analyst Brad Adgate told the BBC. Nonetheless, he added: ""I always thought this would be a newspaper that would be able to withstand the digital tide because of the name and the prestige. It is, next to the New York Times, the most prestigious paper in the country."" According to the Alliance for Audited Media, a newspaper auditing firm, the Washington Post was the seventh most popular daily newspaper in the US this year, with a total circulation of 474,767 - a 6.5% decline on last year. In an open letter posted on the Washington Post's website, Mr Bezos said he would not be leading the paper on a day-to-day basis and sought to reassure nervous employees, but saying he would not seek to change ""the values"" of the paper. However, he added: ""There will, of course, be change at The Post over the coming years...The internet is transforming almost every element of the news business: shortening news cycles, eroding long-reliable revenue sources, and enabling new kinds of competition, some of which bear little or no news-gathering costs."" Mr Bezos said he did not have a plan yet for what exactly he thought those changes would be. Faded glory The sale took many by surprise. ""We've all been broadsided by the acquisition. There are few things that come as a surprise any more but this one did,"" said Rebecca Lieb, an industry analyst at the Altimeter Group. ""However, when you really start thinking about it, it makes sense - all because of digital,"" she said, citing Mr Bezos's experience with digital delivery and personalisation at Amazon. In a filing with regulators, the company said, however, that Mr Bezos was not purchasing its other notable online properties: Slate magazine, TheRoot.com, and Foreign Policy. This is the second sale of a major US newspaper in as many days. Over the weekend, the New York Times announced it had sold another iconic newspaper, the Boston Globe, to John W. Henry, the owner of the baseball team the Boston Red Sox, for $70m - a fraction of the $1.1bn the company had paid for the paper in 1993.",电子商网巨头亚马逊的总裁贝索斯同意以2.5亿美元的价格收购著名美国报纸《华盛顿邮报》。,亚马逊总裁贝索斯希望通过收购华邮进一步“发明”和“试验”。 贝索斯是以个人资产而并非亚马逊集团的名义出面收购华邮集团麾下全部产业。 华邮集团在过去80年中一直有报业世家格兰姆家族控制。 华邮集团总裁唐纳德·格兰姆在新闻发布会上说：“多年面对新闻出版业的雷同挑战，让我们觉得也许换一个业主可能会对邮报庚有益。” 他还补充说：“贝索斯先生有卓著的科技和商业天才，他从长远着眼的战略观和个人品格使他应该成为邮报绝好的新业主。” 《华盛顿邮报》集团麾下除报纸外，还有卡普兰职业考试和培训集团等多项产业。 据悉，集团出售后，包括卡普兰在内的细节尚未公布的产业仍将继续由格兰姆家族控制。 交易预计将在60日之内完成。 报业不景 曾因率先独家报道“水门事件”而闻名世界的《华盛顿邮报》是与《纽约时报》齐名的美国影响巨大的报纸之一。 然而，在西方世界报业布景的大气候下报纸发行量逐年递减；集团试图开辟网络版和拓展网上广告业务的尝试结果也不尽人意。 BBC在华盛顿的记者表示，《华盛顿邮报》近年来特别是在年轻人中的发行量跌速迅猛； 华邮去年的日发行量再次同比下降6.5%到474767份。 周末，《纽约时报》也宣布把麾下的《波士顿环球报》以7千万美元价格脱手，远远低于集团1993年购入后者是支付的11亿美元价格。 成功收购华邮集团将使贝索斯成为美国少数几个最有影响的新闻“内容提供者”。 亚马逊集团目前除网络商品销售外还拓展了规模巨大的电子图书出版业务。 集团出版的电子书目系列《绞手的女儿》销量突破百万，成为电子出版业的新里程碑。 上周，亚马逊还推出了五套随选视像试播节目； 与此同时，集团的网络电子游戏业务也方兴未艾。 贝索斯在一份书面声明中表示，他收购华邮纯属个人行为，与亚马逊无关； 他还表示，报业墨守成规是没有希望的，而收购华邮的目的是进一步推动“发明”和“试验”。 （编译：晧宇 责编：路西）
"Lawyers said the settlement to resolve civil lawsuits and compensate alleged victims was worth about $44m (£34.7m). Mr Weinstein denies sexually harassing or abusing over 75 women. He will stand trial in New York in June on criminal charges brought by two women, including rape. Adam Harris, a lawyer for the studio co-founder Bob Weinstein told a judge that ""an economic agreement in principle"" had been reached, the Associated Press news agency reports. He added: ""I personally am very optimistic."" Mr Weinstein's team later told the Wall Street Journal that the size of the settlement would be approximately $44m. Actress Ashley Judd, one of the first women to come forward, tweeted that her separate legal case against Mr Weinstein was ongoing and that she intended to take him to trial. Who is Harvey Weinstein? The 67-year-old is one of Hollywood's most famous producers and has worked on a number of award-winning films, including Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and The Artist. In total, the films he worked on have generated over 81 Oscars since 1999 and founded the Miramax entertainment company in the 1970s, which initially focused on art-house films. In 2005, he split from Miramax and founded Weinstein Co, alongside his brother Bob. In 2017, Quartz reported that Mr Weinstein had become so powerful in Hollywood that he had been thanked as many times as God in Oscar acceptance speeches. How did the scandal unfold? In October 2017, the New York Times published a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein. Actresses Rose McGowan and Ms Judd were among the first women to come forward. The accusations include forcing women to massage him and watch him naked. He also allegedly promised to help some women advance their careers in return for sexual favours. The film producer issued an apology acknowledging he had ""caused a lot of pain"" - but denied allegations that he harassed female employees over nearly three decades. The outcry against Mr Weinstein led to the #MeToo movement, which has seen hundreds of women accusing high-profile men in business, government and entertainment of sexual abuse and harassment. As the accusations mounted, his company Weinstein Co dismissed him and filed for bankruptcy. What would be in the deal? The $44m sum would be divvied among a number of accusers, their attorneys and attorneys for some of the defendants. The accusers, their lawyers, as well as former Weinstein Company employers and creditors would have $30m split among them, according to US media reports. The remaining $14m would be allocated for the legal fees of Mr Weinstein's associates, including former board members of his production company who were named as defendants in lawsuits. The names of the women involved in the settlement have not been released. The objective of the deal is to reach a global settlement of all civil suits filed against Mr Weinstein in the US, UK and Canada, the Wall Street Journal reported. Some of the plaintiffs involved in the deal have balked at the settlement amount, potentially undermining the deal, Variety reported. Mediation is expected to continue next week. So far, there have reportedly been more than 11 separate mediation sessions between the parties, amounting to about 133 hours. A 15 May court filing described the process as ""highly adversarial"". The settlement is a civil matter so will have no bearing on the pending criminal cases against the former movie mogul. Mr Weinstein is due to go on trial in New York on 3 June on five charges of sexually assaulting two women. He has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. If found guilty, he could spend the rest of his life in prison.",据美国媒体报道，丑闻缠身的好莱坞著名制片人哈维·韦恩斯坦以及他的前电影公司董事会成员就韦恩斯坦被控性侵等不当行为一事，与指控他的多名女性达成初步和解协议。,多名女星曾站出来指控韦恩斯坦的性骚扰行为。 律师表示，这份民事诉讼和解协议以及对案件受害人的赔偿大约值4400万美元（3470万英镑）。 韦恩斯坦被指对超过75名女性有过性骚扰或者不当对待，但韦恩斯坦一直否认。 另一方面，他将于6月在纽约就两名女性提出的刑事指控出庭受审，罪名当中包括强奸。 美联社报道指，电影公司的另一名创始人、哈维的兄弟鲍勃·韦恩斯坦（Bob Weinstein）的律师亚当·哈里斯（Adam Harris）向法官表示，他们与民事案件的案件受害人达成“原则上的经济协议”。 他还表示：“我个人是非常乐观。” 之后，韦恩斯坦的团队向《华尔街日报》表示，和解协议的金额将会达到大约4400万美元。 演星阿什莉·贾德（Ashley Judd，艾殊莉·茱迪）是最早站出来指控韦恩斯坦的女性之一，她在这一消息传出后在推特（Twitter）上发文表示，她控告韦恩斯坦的案件是另外一宗独立的法律案件，目前诉讼仍然继续，而她要将他告上法庭。 Ashley Judd: I was not frightened of Harvey Weinstein 哈维·韦恩斯坦其人 67岁的哈维·韦恩斯坦是好莱坞最著名的制片人之一，他监制过一系列得奖电影，包括《莎翁情史》（Shakespeare in Love，《写我深情》）、《国王的演讲》（The King's Speech，《皇上无话儿》）以及《艺术家》（The Artist，《星光梦里人》）。 自1999年至今，他监制过的电影总共赢得过81座奥斯卡小金人。他在1970年代创办了米拉麦克斯（Miramax）电影公司，该公司一开始主要是制作艺术片。 2005年，他与米拉麦克斯分道扬镳，与弟弟鲍勃共同创办韦恩斯坦影业（Weinstein Co）。 2017年，新闻网站Quartz报道，韦恩斯坦在好莱坞已经权倾一时，以至于在奥斯卡的获奖致辞当中，人们感谢他的次数与感谢上帝不相上下。 丑闻曝光始末 2017年10月，《纽约时报》刊发报道，披露数十年来针对哈维·韦恩斯坦性骚扰的指控细节。 除阿什莉·贾德之外，演员露丝·麦戈万（Rose McGowan）也是最早站出来指控的女性之一。 这些指控当中，包括指控韦恩斯坦强迫多名女性为他按摩，以及看他裸体。他还被指曾答应帮助一些女性的事业发展，以此换取性服务。 这名电影制片人发表过一份道歉声明，承认自己曾经给他人“造成很多痛苦”，但是他否认自己曾在近三十年当中骚扰多名女性雇员。 对韦恩斯坦的公开指控引发了一场被称为“#MeToo（我也是）”的运动，数以百计的女性出来指控一些高知名度的男性性骚扰和性侵害，他们所属领域包括商界、政界和娱乐界。 随着指控越来越多，韦恩斯坦影业不得不解雇哈维，并申请破产。 和解协议细节 4400万美元的赔偿将会被多名指控者以及律师瓜分，这当中包括受害人的律师以及一些辩护人的律师。 据美国媒体报道，案件多名原告和她们的律师，还有韦恩斯坦影业的前雇员和债权人，将会瓜分其中的3000万美元。余下的1400万美元将属于韦恩斯坦法律团队的费用，包括一些在案件中被列为辩护人的电影公司前董事会成员。 和解协议涉及的女性事主名单未有公开。 《华尔街日报》指，这份协议的目的，是要达成一项对全世界所有针对韦恩斯坦的民事起诉有效的和解方案。目前韦恩斯坦在美国、英国及加拿大均有被起诉。 《综艺》（Variety）杂志报道，其中一些涉事的原告对于和解协议的金额犹豫不决，这有可能给协议带来不确定因素。 预计调解工作将会在下周继续进行。至目前为止，据报在不同利益方之间已经进行了超过11场调解会议，合共用时超过133小时。5月15日，法庭文件形容调解过程是“高度对立”。 这项协议是针对一宗民事事务，因为对于这名电影大亨受到的其他刑事指控审讯没有影响。 韦恩斯坦将要在6月3日出庭，就两名女性的五项性侵指控接受审讯。他已经否认控罪，也否认了所有非自愿发生性行为的指控。 一经定罪，韦恩斯坦可能会在监狱中度过余生。
"Hundreds of babies were born in Brazil last year with microcephaly, a syndrome where children are born with unusually small heads. The defects coincided with a spike in Zika infections, leading experts to suspect the mosquito-borne virus. Research has now affirmed those experts' suspicions, the CDC said.

""Everything we know about this virus seems to be scarier than we initially thought,"" said Dr Anne Schuchat of the CDC. Zika virus was first diagnosed in 1947 in Uganda, but symptoms have typically been mild, including rash, joint pain and fever. The current outbreak started in 2015 in Brazil and the symptoms have been much more severe. Nearly 200 babies have died as result of the virus. Researchers are interesting learning why some cases of the virus result in birth defects while others do not. Some women who were infected with Zika while pregnant gave birth to apparently healthy children. There have been 346 confirmed cases of Zika in the continental United States, according to the CDC, all associated with travel. CDC officials said the findings do not change the agency's earlier guidance to pregnant women. The CDC has discouraged pregnant women from travelling to places where the Zika virus is spreading, mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean. Dr Frieden said intensive research was under way to find out much more about the mosquito-borne virus and to develop a vaccine for it, although he warned that that could still be years away. This is the first time that mosquito bites have caused birth defects, Dr Frieden said. The virus can be transmitted by sexual contact as well.",美国疾病防治与控制中心已证实寨卡病毒（Zika virus）可导致包括“小头症”（microcepaly）在内的严重的新生儿缺陷。,美国疾病防治与控制中心主任富莱顿表示，这是首次发现孕期妇女被蚊子叮咬可以导致新生儿缺陷。 巴西去年出生的成千上万的婴儿被诊断出患有“小头症”。众多新生儿被发现出现脑部缺陷的之际，感染寨卡病毒的人数亦大幅上升，这使卫生专家开始怀疑这种由蚊子携带的病毒与此相关。 美国疾病防治与控制中心说，最新研究已证实专家当初的怀疑。 美国疾病防治与控制中心主任托马斯·富莱顿表示，“这项研究标志着寨卡病毒爆发的一个转折点。现在已经清楚，这种病毒可以导致小头症”。 美国卫生官员星期一警告说，兹卡病毒爆发将对美国带来影响，他呼吁当局提供更多拨款抗击寨卡病毒的传播。 美国疾病防治与控制中心主任副主任舒查特表示，“据我们目前对寨卡病毒的认知显示，这种病毒远比我们预料的更可怕”。 寨卡病毒患者于1947年在乌干达首次被确诊，但患者症状比较温和，包括出现皮疹、关节疼痛和发烧。 兹卡病毒主要是通过蚊子叮咬传播。 巴西在2015年爆发寨卡病毒，但这次患者的症状更加严重。近200名新生儿感染这种病毒而死亡。 美国疾病防治与控制中心的声明说，女性在孕期感染寨卡病毒后，生出有缺陷婴儿的风险增加，但并不表示所有孕期感染寨卡病毒的女性都将生出有缺陷的婴儿。 美国疾病防治与控制中心表示，美国目前共有346宗确认的寨卡病毒个案，所有患者的感染都与旅行有关。 该中心官员说，有关发现并未改变早些时候对孕妇发出的预防寨卡病毒指南的内容。 美国疾病防治与控制中心劝阻孕期妇女前往寨卡病毒爆发的地区，其中大部分位于拉丁美洲和加勒比海。 美国疾病防治与控制中心主任富莱顿表示，正加大对蚊子如何传播寨卡病毒的研究力度，并研发应对的疫苗。但他警告说，目前离疫苗的成功研发也许还有许多年。 但他指出，这是首次发现孕期妇女被蚊子叮咬可以导致新生儿缺陷。寨卡病毒也可以通过性生活传播。 （编译／责编：萧尔）
"By Judith BurnsBBC News education reporter The gap between income and expenditure for a typical student amounts to more than £7,600 according to NUS analysis. The union compared the cost of living and studying for the 39-week 2013-14 academic year with typical income from government grants and loans. The government said it was targeting support at those who needed it most. Rent, bills and other outgoings continue to rise year after year above the rate of inflation but grants and loan rates were frozen this year and will only rise by 1% next year, says the union. It estimates that a student living outside London will pay an average of £21,440 in tuition fees, books, equipment, rent, travel and other living expenses. Against this, they have a potential income of £13,747 composed of their tuition fee loan plus maintenance loans and the grants available to those on average and low incomes. This leaves a shortfall of £7,693. In London, higher rents mean students typically spend £23,187 says the union - but they are also eligible for a higher maintenance loan of £6,090 though this still leaves them with a shortfall of £7,654, says the union. The union adds that some students from less well-off families who are eligible for grants are facing an additional squeeze as the level at which they can claim maximum support has remained at a household income of £25,000 since 2008. NUS president Toni Pearce said: ""Those who do not have the rare luxury of resorting to the 'bank of mum and dad' are increasingly being driven to work full-time alongside study where jobs can be found, or worse still, into the arms of predatory pay day lenders just to make ends meet. ""We need a financial support system that ensures students get what the support they need, when they need it."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills said the government's student finance package was designed to target support at students from the poorest households. ""This year, students from the lowest income households can access over £7,100 of living-cost support, of which over £3,350 does not have to be repaid. ""The government also provides additional, non-repayable support to students in specific circumstances, such as students with children and disabled students. ""Scholarships and bursaries are also available from most universities, and students in hardship can apply for additional support through the Access to Learning Fund.""",英国全英学联称，由于学生贷款和政府对贫困学生的资助金赶不上房租水电等费用的上涨，在英格兰的大学生面临生活费危机。,"全英学联说，大学生的生活开支越来越高，许多学生必须工作以完成学业。 根据全英学联的分析，大学生收入和生活开支之间的差额超过7600英镑。 全英学联是计算了2013-14学年39周所需的基本生活费，并同学生在一学年中从政府获得的贷款或助学资金相比较后得出了这一结论。 房租，水电和其他费用连年上涨，上涨幅度远高于通货膨胀水平。而与此同时，学生贷款和政府对贫困学生的助学金今年冻结，明年也只会上升1%。 全英学联估计，在伦敦以外，一名大学生的学费、书本费、学习用具、房租、交通费和其他生活费用加在一起平均需要21,440英镑。 而学生能得到的学费和生活费贷款大约只有13,747英镑。 这中间有一个7693英镑的短缺。 而在伦敦，这种情况更为严重。伦敦的高房租意味着住在伦敦的大学生一年的费用需要23,187英镑。虽然他们能得到较高的贷款，但也还是有7654英镑的短缺。 全英学联主席表示，越来越多得不到任何父母资助的大学生不得不在学习之外靠打工的收入来完成学业。 英国恩兹利保险公司（Endsleigh）和全英学联不久前对1704名大学生进行的问卷调查显示，57%的学生读大学时都做一些业余工作，主要用以支付他们的生活开支。 受访的学生中，超过半数（55%）学生将打工挣来的钱用于支付他们的宿舍、饮食和其它生活必需开支。 （编译/责编：李莉）"
"Britain's highest court said seven judges would hear the case in February. Mr Assange, who remains on conditional bail in the UK, is wanted by Swedish authorities for questioning over allegations of sexual assault. The 40-year-old Australian denies the allegations and claims they are politically motivated. The High Court previously approved his extradition, a decision that Mr Assange argues was unlawful. The Swedish authorities are seeking to put him on trial on accusations of raping one woman and ""sexually molesting and coercing"" another in Stockholm in August 2010. Mr Assange's Wikileaks website published a mass of material from leaked diplomatic cables embarrassing several governments. The US Army analyst suspected of leaking the documents appeared in an American military court on Friday, where he faces 22 charges of obtaining and distributing government secrets. Bradley Manning made his first appearance in a courthouse in Maryland. He faces a court martial next year and, if convicted, could face life in prison. The US government has already said it will not seek the death penalty, which is the maximum sentence for ""aiding the enemy"", one of the charges faced by Mr Manning. 'Great importance' Earlier this month in the UK, two High Court judges, Sir John Thomas and Mr Justice Ouseley, decided that Mr Assange had raised a question on extradition law ""of general public importance"" and gave him 14 days to ask the Supreme Court for a final UK ruling. On Friday, a Supreme Court spokesman said its justices had agreed to hear the case ""given the great public importance of the issue raised, which is whether a prosecutor is a judicial authority"". He said: ""A panel of three Supreme Court Justices - Lord Hope, Lord Mance and Lord Dyson - has considered the written submissions of the parties; this is the court's usual practice for considering applications for permission to appeal. ""The Supreme Court has granted permission to appeal and a hearing has been scheduled for two days, beginning on 1 February 2012."" The Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement: ""If, after the Supreme Court has heard the case, it dismisses Mr Assange's appeal, then his only further remedy is to apply immediately to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which will respond within 14 days. ""If it confirms that it does not agree to take the case then that is an end of the matter."" The CPS said if the court in Strasbourg did decline to take the case then Mr Assange would be extradited to Sweden as soon as practicable.",瑞典斯德哥尔摩地区法院星期三晚些时候将决定是否取消针对维基解密（WikiLeaks）创办人阿桑奇（Julian Assange）的逮捕令。,维基解密创办人阿桑奇已在厄瓜多尔住英大使馆滞留两年。 阿桑奇已经在向他提供庇护的厄瓜多尔驻伦敦大使馆滞留了两年。他的律师表示，瑞典检查官拒绝在厄瓜多尔使馆与阿桑奇面谈，因此过度拖延了阿桑奇所谓性侵案的审理时间。 阿桑奇的律师对法新社说：“我们对这次开庭很有信心。我们认为我们的论点很有力，能够促使法庭取消以前的决定。” 但是，即使逮捕令被取消，阿桑奇也不一定能够立即自由离开厄瓜多尔使馆。 阿桑奇在6月份通过电话会议告诉媒体记者，即使成功取消逮捕令，“我还有一个更大的问题，那就是美国可能会起诉我，并且可能要求引渡。” 维基解密网站2010年公开了大量有关伊拉克战争和阿富汗战争的美国外交机密文件，惹怒了美国政府。 2012年，他被控在瑞典性侵女性，瑞典司法当局要求引渡；同年6月，阿桑奇就引渡令提出的上诉被拒绝后进入伦敦的厄瓜多尔使馆。 他否认性犯罪指控，称控罪是出于政治动机。 英国拒绝向阿桑奇提供安全离境的途径，因此他一直被困在厄瓜多尔使馆里。 （编译：秦川/责编：横路）
"By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website Its report said 50g of processed meat a day - less than two slices of bacon - increased the chance of developing colorectal cancer by 18%. Meanwhile, it said red meats were ""probably carcinogenic"" but there was limited evidence. The WHO did stress that meat also had health benefits. Cancer Research UK said this was a reason to cut down rather than give up red and processed meats. And added that an occasional bacon sandwich would do little harm. What is processed meat? Processed meat has been modified to either extend its shelf life or change the taste and the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives. Simply putting beef through a mincer does not mean the resulting mince is ""processed"" unless it is modified further. Processed meat includes bacon, sausages, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, beef jerky and ham as well as canned meat and meat-based sauces. It is the chemicals involved in the processing which could be increasing the risk of cancer. High temperature cooking, such as on a barbeque, can also create carcinogenic chemicals. In the UK, around six out of every 100 people get bowel cancer at some point in their lives. If they were all given an extra 50g of bacon a day for the rest of their lives then the risk would increase by 18% to around seven in 100 people getting bowel cancer. ""So that's one extra case of bowel cancer in all those 100 lifetime bacon-eaters,"" argued Sir David Spiegelhalter, a risk professor from the University of Cambridge. How bad? The WHO has come to the conclusion on the advice of its International Agency for Research on Cancer, which assesses the best available scientific evidence. It has now placed processed meat in the same category as plutonium, but also alcohol as they definitely do cause cancer. However, this does not mean they are equally dangerous. A bacon sandwich is not as bad as smoking. ""For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal (bowel) cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,"" Dr Kurt Straif from the WHO said. Estimates suggest 34,000 deaths from cancer every year could be down to diets high in processed meat. Red meat risk In context 21% of bowel cancers are caused by processed or red meat 86% of lung cancers are caused by tobacco 19% of all cancers caused by tobacco compared to 3% of all cancers ascribed to red or processed meat That is in contrast to one million deaths from cancer caused by smoking and 600,000 attributed to alcohol each year. Red meat does have nutritional value too and is a major source of iron, zinc and vitamin B12. However, the WHO said there was limited evidence that 100g of red meat a day increased the risk of cancer by 17%. An eight ounce steak is 225g. The WHO said its findings were important for helping countries give balanced dietary advice. Little harm Prof Tim Key, from the Cancer Research UK and the University of Oxford, said: ""This decision doesn't mean you need to stop eating any red and processed meat, but if you eat lots of it you may want to think about cutting down. ""Eating a bacon bap every once in a while isn't going to do much harm - having a healthy diet is all about moderation."" Dr Teresa Norat, one of the advisors to the WHO report and from Imperial College London, said there were many factors causing bowel cancer. She told BBC News website: ""People should limit consumption of red meat and avoid consuming processed meat, but they should also have a diet rich in fibre, from fruit and vegetables and maintain an adequate body weight throughout life and limit the consumption of alcohol and be physically active."" The industry body the Meat Advisory Panel said ""avoiding red meat in the diet is not a protective strategy against cancer"" and said the focus should be alcohol, smoking and body weight.",世界卫生组织（WHO）在最新发表的报告中说，吃加工肉例如培根、香肠以及火腿的确可能增加患癌的风险。,加工肉制品包括培根、香肠、火腿、蒜味咸辣肠等。 报告说，一天吃50克的加工肉，也就是说不到两片培根，可以增加患结直肠癌18%的几率。 但至于红肉“可能致癌”这个说法目前证据有限。 英国的建议说，吃过多的红肉以及加工类的肉制品可能会增加肠癌的风险。 然而，英国卫生部说，红肉也是健康饮食的一部分。 红肉 红肉包括牛羊肉和猪肉，它们的颜色比较深，因为它们所含的血红蛋白和肌红蛋白、铁等比较高。 而加工肉制品由于不是鲜肉，因此为了延长其保鲜期都添加了一些防腐剂，或是使用了腌、熏以及盐等处理手法。 加工肉制品包括培根、香肠、火腿、蒜味咸辣肠等。 正是由于这种处理方法才增加了致癌的危险。 肉类是蛋白、B族维生素以及铁、锌等矿物质的良好来源。 英国卫生部的建议是可以吃比较健康的肉制品，比如瘦肉、瘦肉馅，少吃加工肉。 据英国饮食最新调查说，英国成年人每天平均吃71克红肉。 而官方的建议是人们每天不应吃超过70克的红肉，也就是说两根香肠、或是两片培根。 但可能许多人都超过这一限量，而且红肉也富含饱和脂肪以及盐。 当然，也有健康专家说，没有哪一种单一食品可以致癌，关键是要均衡。 而最有害健康的则是吸烟，因为香烟中含有多种化学致癌物。 同时，要保持正常的体重，不要过度的饮酒等。 编译：凯露/责编：董乐
"By Judith BurnsBBC News education reporter Researchers for Which? University have uncovered dozens of daft groups across UK campuses. Despite higher fees and precarious job prospects, student clubs seem keen to show it is still possible to have fun. Nerdfighters, for example, is for those ""not composed of cells and tissue, but instead made entirely of awesome"". Drinking is key to these groups, as is eating - but dressing up in a pantomime costume and running around the city centre also seems important. 'Nerd positive' There are groups to suit the strangest tastes from Competitive Eating, wearing your onesie in public in the KiguSoc or brewing mead dressed as a Viking. Essex University's Mario Kart Society ""is based on the Mario Kart Double Dash game. There's a Double Dash league and knockout tournaments"", as well as social events and volunteering, says their website. These include ""a huge amount of dress up and a variety of different themes, such as a Mario v Luigi themed night."" If you want to run through Colchester dressed as a rabbit - this may be the club for you. Nerdfighters Societies can be found at UK universities including Manchester Metropolitan and University of Bath. ""This is a nerd positive society, based mostly on the works of the vlogbrothers, the awesome John and Hank Green"", proclaims the MMU Nerdfighters Society website. The idea is to ""break down the nerd stereotype and fight for good causes"", while attending quiz nights and movie marathons. At Plymouth University, members of the Viking Society take part in traditional Viking games and brew their own mead as well as going for walks in full Viking kit. It aims to appeal to ""those who are interested to see the hardships of the average Viking man or woman"". University of York's Kigusoc ""aims to bring together people who have a genuine enthusiasm for Kigus"" or Japanese-style animal themed 'onesies'. ""Although typically designed for indoor use, we believe there is no occasion or activity that is not improved by a Kigu. ""KiguSoc is for those who aren't afraid to get out there and show their love of fleece to the world"", says their webpage. Several universities have an Assassin's Guild where players track down and perform mock assassinations on other members of the society while trying to avoid detection and assassination themselves. ""No, we are not a group of homicidal students that go round opening fire on unsuspecting students. Well not exactly..."", says Sheffield Assassins website. Not quite as lethal but probably equally energetic are the Twenty Minute Societies run by students at Newcastle, Lincoln and Birmingham. These societies send out weekly messages, with the address of a random location. Members have to get there within 20 minutes. Their Facebook walls include injunctions like: ""Get outside the union nowwww xxxxxx"" and last term were promising more events ""once those pesky exams are over"". University of Kent's Competitive Eating Society does what it says on the tin. Members aim to eat competitively, to experience new foods and local cuisines but ""also to maintain a healthy approach to competitive eating and encourage a healthy lifestyle"". Members pictured on their Facebook page look fairly slender and meet weekly during term-time ""to try the tastiest challenges out there."" These include the ""Metre of Pizza Challenge"". 'Gentlemanly pursuits' Somewhat more discriminating is the Bath University Curry Appreciation Society offering ""amazing socials with great curry, great company and at a great price"". The Keele Society of Gentlemanly Pursuits ""indulges in the finer things in life such as fine liquors and music of good quality"". If many of these pursuits appear puerile, the ultimate example is The Sheila and her dog Society in Cambridge. At meetings members regress to age six, drink cocoa and read children's stories to each other. Their website declares the group ""the silliest society in Cambridge - no matter what PoohSoc says"". The Little Prince, a spokesman for the the group, said it is designed to appeal to shyer students - who like to be silly - but in relative privacy. Membership is for life and is not confined to students, the prince told BBC News. Raechel Mattey of the National Union of Students said: ""One of the great freedoms about going to college and university is the chance for each student to create and shape activities. ""It can be an enormous pressure to be a student today, so it's definitely right that universities and unions can aid in the fun side of life too.""",新生们口袋里装着贷款准备上大学，关注点却是学校里最古怪的学生社团。,调查发现，几十个疯狂的学生社团遍布英国校园。 调查发现，几十个疯狂的学生社团已经遍布英国校园。 尽管较高的学费和不明朗的就业前景或多或少影响着大学生们的心情，但这些学生俱乐部还是为学生们的校园生活带来了乐趣。 一起吃喝当然是这些社团聚会的重点，除此之外，身着有趣主题服装去市中心闲逛对社团成员们来说也非常重要。 “积极的书呆子们” 有的社团为了在招收社员的激烈竞争中独树一帜，常常别出心裁，比如会有海盗社团的成员们打扮成海盗酿造蜜酒来吸引学生们的眼球。 埃塞克斯（Essex）大学的超级玛莉赛车俱乐部（Mario Kart）在他们的官网上写道“社团是根据游戏‘超级玛莉卡丁车’设立的，社团里举行的比赛，像双重冲击赛和淘汰赛都是和游戏里一样的。” 社团还组织很多主题派对，比如超级玛莉主题之夜等等。 如果你想打扮成一只兔子在科尔切斯特（英格兰东部）开着赛车跑一圈，这个俱乐部可能会让你心动。 书呆子战士（Nerdfighters）俱乐部，号称是为那些“脑子少根弦的书呆子们”开设的俱乐部。 书呆子战士（Nerdfighters）俱乐部成员们 俱乐部的建团理念是“打破对书呆子的刻板印象，为自己战斗。” 你可以在英国的很多学校看到书呆子战士俱乐部的身影，包括曼切斯特大都会大学和巴斯大学。 在普利茅斯大学，海盗社团的成员们不仅可以参加传统的维京游戏，还可以身着海盗服学习酿造蜜酒。 它旨在吸引那些“对于男女海盗们如何艰辛生存感兴趣的人。” 有些大学还有刺客行会社团，社员们作为玩家会模拟躲避追踪，暗杀等游戏。 对于有些人对社团的质疑，谢菲尔德刺客俱乐部的网站上回应说，“我们并不是一群乱杀人的学生，我们不会对那些不知道我们在玩游戏的人下手。” 这些社团会有不同的集结地点以增加活动的神秘性，每周组织者向社员们发出地址信息后，社员必须在20分钟内到达指定地点。 除此之外还有比赛吃东西和咖喱鉴赏社团等有趣而古怪的社团。 全国学生联合会的瑞秋·梅蒂（Raechel Mattey）表示：“大学能给予的最大自由是，给学生们创造和塑造活动的机会。” “现在的学生压力很大，所以这些社团和俱乐部能让学生们看到生活有趣的一面。” （编译：馨月 责编：铃兰）
"Yang Hengjun, a blogger and former Chinese diplomat, has not been heard from since flying from New York to Guangzhou on Saturday, a friend said. Sydney academic Feng Chongyi said he feared that Mr Yang had been detained by Chinese authorities. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said she was ""not aware"" of the case. Mr Yang is believed to have been travelling with his wife, Chinese national Yuan Rui Juan, and young stepson. A social media post by Ms Yuan appeared to show that she was in Beijing, Australian media reported. It is believed that she was interviewed there by Chinese officials after first travelling to Shanghai to leave her son with relatives, the BBC's Stephen McDonell in Beijing reports. 'We've been trying to contact him' Mr Yang, an Australian citizen who now lives in the US, has a sizeable following online and has been critical of China's Communist Party. He was briefly unreachable on a trip to China in 2011 - prompting fears he was missing - but later attributed the episode to a ""misunderstanding"". Associate Prof Feng, an academic at University of Technology Sydney, said he had warned Mr Yang recently against travelling to China, but that Mr Yang had replied that he considered himself to be safe. ""His friends, family, myself - we have been trying to contact him and her these past four days and we all [failed],"" Associate Prof Feng told the BBC. LISTEN: China accused of 'hostage diplomacy' Another friend, Australian journalist John Garnaut, told the Sydney Morning Herald: ""Let's hope he reappears today and we can all agree there's just been a misunderstanding."" In response to a query about Mr Yang, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was ""seeking information about an Australian citizen who has been reported missing in China"". Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she was not aware of the case but would ask relevant departments for information. Correspondents say this follows a similar pattern to the cases of two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were detained in China in recent weeks. In both cases, the foreign ministry initially said it had no knowledge of them being held, then confirmed they were in the hands of state security a few days later. Australia has previously expressed ""concern"" about the arrests of the Canadians. China has denied the detention of the two men is tied to Canada's arrest of a senior Huawei official, Meng Wanzhou, but many analysts believe it is a tit-for-tat action.",澳大利亚当局希望中国调查一名澳大利亚籍华裔作家在中国失踪的事件。,曾在中国外交部供职的杨恒均3月27日在广州失踪。 有关46岁的杨恒均失踪的线索，当时一位自称是杨恒均博客管理员的人士27日5点37分在推特上发表这样的信息：“我是杨老师的博客管理员，今天傍晚接到杨老师电话说在广州白云机场发现有3人跟踪，之后我一直联系不上杨老师，请各界朋友关注。” 澳大利亚有媒体猜测杨恒均可能遭中国当局拘押，并说这可能与中国为了防止境内出现茉莉花革命而大批拘禁异见人士有关。 澳大利亚外交部星期二（3月29日）证实正在调查杨恒均失踪事件。 中国官方则尚未就杨恒均事件发表评论。 杨恒均曾在互联网发表三部曲间谍小说《致命弱点》《致命武器》和《致命追杀》。 他曾在中国外交部和海南省政府工作，也曾分别在美国和澳大利亚进行国际问题研究。 杨恒均也曾在中国以及澳大利亚从事编辑工作。
"Carrie GracieFormer China editor@BBCCarrieon Twitter With it comes another demonstration of how adept Beijing is becoming at inching back and forth along the policy tightrope it has installed between Washington and Pyongyang. At the same time, muttering mounts among Chinese experts and the public as to the wisdom of tightrope walking and the availability of alternatives. To placate the United States and signal displeasure with North Korea, China voted for the latest sanctions even as it insisted on watering them down to let Kim Jong-un know that China will not let him fall. Beijing does not believe that sanctions will force the North Korean leader to surrender his weapons. It wants Washington to talk to Pyongyang. And it wants Pyongyang to stop nuclear and missile tests. But neither is listening and with the North Korean tests accelerating and rhetoric on both sides escalating, the stakes are very high. The last war on the Korean peninsula pitted the US against China at a cost of millions of military and civilian lives. Unilateral pre-emptive military action by the US would risk conflict with China again. Despite deep frustration with Kim Jong-un, North Korea is a Chinese neighbour and ally, a fellow Leninist state with a shared victim narrative about the past and a shared ambition for the future to remove the US presence in North East Asia. Moreover, the chief objectives of the Chinese Communist Party are domestic: stability at home and its own firm grip on power. Its current assessment is that these objectives are best advanced by keeping Kim Jong-un in place. So while China does not want a nuclear North Korea, it wants a North Korean collapse even less and it will resist any sanctions which risk that outcome. Especially as it does not believe measures like a full oil embargo would push North Korea to disarm but instead force it further into a corner. Co-operation and mistrust It's hardly surprising that Beijing empathises with North Korean insecurity, given that for decades it suspected the US of plans for containment and regime change to remove the Chinese Communist Party. It wants the US to talk to the Kim regime as a first move in building trust. So co-operating with the latest round of strengthened sanctions is China's way of signalling its displeasure with what it sees as Pyongyang's reckless pursuit of nuclear and missile programmes. And a way to avoid accusations of complicity from Washington and any danger of its economy suffering significant damage from secondary sanctions against Chinese companies. But Beijing does not see sanctions as a route to greater security on the Korean peninsula. And while it carefully inches back and forth along its tightrope, the geopolitical landscape beneath is shifting. For example, North Korea's accelerated drive for nuclear weapons raises the question of whether and for how long South Korea and even Japan will remain non-nuclear. Already China has risked its previously burgeoning relationship with Seoul to punish it for deploying an American anti-missile system known as Thaad (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence). Even now Beijing fails to exploit the cracks that have emerged between President Donald Trump and South Korea's President Moon Jae-in because of its loathing for Thaad. But that missile defence system was deployed as a response to North Korea's weapons programme. A new arms race now threatens to undermine China's grand plans to ease the US out of North East Asia and dominate regional security. Nuclear weapons in South Korea or even Japanese hands may be next. With India, Russia and Pakistan already nuclear powers, not to mention the US, China may end up with more nuclear armed neighbours than any other country in the world. Chinese patience overstretched Strict censorship keeps public debate at bay, but there are signs of growing unease among experts and public alike, a growing number of voices pointing out that North Korea is getting away with undermining Chinese national interest. But it is hard for China to climb down from its practised tightrope act to tackle the underlying strategic landscape. Any lasting solution to the Korean problem will require greater trust between China and the US and sustained negotiations between all interested parties on long term security for the peninsula. They will have to discuss what a peace treaty would look like to conclude the Korean war, diplomatic recognition of Pyongyang, security guarantees, economic engagement and perhaps even in the long run the departure of US forces. The risks to China of such an endeavour would be very great, particularly as the partners are so singularly unpromising. On one hand an unpredictable US president whose policy seems to shift from tweet to tweet and day to day. On the other hand a ruthless and unscrupulous young dictator who has pointedly avoided visiting Beijing since coming to power, murdered those in his family who had close links with China and carefully timed his missile tests to embarrass Beijing. But even if the partners were different it is hard to imagine that China would be ready to address the profound questions about regional security which the North Korea crisis now throws up. Locked into an ever more nationalist narrative of its interests and destiny, it seems determined to double down on a 20th Century security strategy rather than to use this crisis to shape a new one.",一个星期过去，联合国安理会通过向朝鲜施加更多制裁。,朝鲜多次无视联合国安理会的禁制试测导弹，令中国领导层尴尬不已。 这也展现出北京越来越能在自己分别对美国和朝鲜的政策之间取得平衡。与此同时，中国一众专家和民众都在讨论这种“走钢丝”的艺术和其他解决方案的可能性。 在安理会议决应否对朝鲜采取更多制裁行动时，北京为了安抚美国同时对朝鲜表示不满，投下赞成票。但投票之前，中国当局成功争取将制裁的程度减轻，让朝鲜领导人金正恩感觉到北京并不会完全离朝鲜而去。 北京并不认为金正恩会因为害怕要面对制裁，而放弃发展核武。它希望美国会跟朝鲜谈判，同时又希望平壤当局停止核武和导弹试验。 但似乎双方均没有把中国的话听进去。朝鲜继续试射导弹，而各方的隔空叫骂也越来越激烈。 战争的代价十分巨大。上一次朝鲜半岛爆发战争时，各方总共有过百万军民伤亡。 如果美国单方面向朝鲜发动攻击，可能引发与中国的冲突。虽然中国对朝鲜近年的举动十分沮丧，它仍然是中国的邻国，两者过去都将自己定义为受害者，它们都希望将美国从亚洲驱逐出去。 况且，中国共产党最重视的目标与内政有关：就是维持国内稳定，也要维持自己的执政地位。它认为，达到这两个目标的最好方法，就是让金正恩继续掌权。 所以说，如果要中国选择让朝鲜当局拥有核武，还是任由它倒台，中国必定会选择前者，它也必定会毫无保留地反抗任何可能会令朝鲜倒台的联合国制裁。而且，北京当局不认为全面禁运石油等制裁会令朝鲜放弃核武，反过来会迫得朝鲜更紧。 互相合作，却互不信任 联合国向朝鲜实施许多制裁，却无阻朝鲜发展军队和核武器的决心。 中国不断强调要求朝鲜放弃核武会令平壤当局感到不安这个说法，并不令人觉得奇怪。北京当局多年来都怀疑美国有计划，逐步围堵中国，最后使北京当局倒台。中国多次要求美国跟金正恩对话，为的就是要双方建立信任。 所以说，中国在联合国加强针对朝鲜的制裁行动中持合作态度，目的就是一方面要令朝鲜感到中国对它不断追求要发展核武十分不满，另一方面向美国展示自己并没有跟朝鲜合伙，还有就是令中国公司不会受朝鲜问题牵连，而遭受制裁。 但这无改中国当局认为制裁不能改善朝鲜半岛局势的看法。 中国在朝鲜和美国之间走钢丝的同时，周边的情况也不断在改变。例如，朝鲜发展核武使外界怀疑，韩国和日本究竟会不会坚持拒绝发展核武。 中国已经因为韩国同意让美国在境内部署萨德导弹系统，一改与首尔之前的紧密关系而惩罚韩方。但至今，北京当局仍未能就部署萨德系统一事，乘势加深韩国总统文在寅与美国总统特朗普之间的分歧。 韩国指部署萨德系统是为了防备朝鲜导弹，但中国认为系统无助改善朝鲜半岛危机。 韩国部署萨德系统的原因， 是为了防备来自朝鲜的威胁。中国计划要减少美国在东北的影响力并填补美国留下的空白，但似乎亚太地区的军事竞赛会令它的计划行不通。而这个军事竞赛的下一步，很可能就是日本和韩国取得核武器。 中国的许多邻居，包括印度、俄罗斯和巴基斯坦，均已经拥有核武器。如果日本和韩国都取得核武，加上美国，中国可能成为全世界最多核武邻居的国家。 中国耐性的极限 中国官方对公众讨论朝鲜问题有相当多的限制，但这没能遮蔽他们对局势的担忧。他们指，朝鲜的举动破坏中国的利益，北京当局却坐视不理。 但中国已经习惯在美国和朝鲜之间走钢丝，要它从钢丝爬下来可不是一件容易的事。如果各方要就朝鲜问题达成更长远的解决方案，中国和美国必须更信任对方。 各方需要探讨的事情，包括签署一份正式结束韩战的和约，也要就平壤当局的外交地位、保障、经济交流、甚至美国撤军等议题展开讨论。 如果事情向这个方向发展，它不能小看它带来的危险性，尤其因为各方都令它感到不乐观。 朝鲜跟美国在中国眼中，似乎一样不可预测。 中国面对的，一方面是一个政策每天都在改变、行径无法预测的美国总统，另一方面是一个从上任开始就回避到访北京的残酷年轻独裁者，而这个独裁者不单杀害他的家庭里多名与北京关系密切的人，更多次发射导弹，令北京尴尬。 但即使危机不涉及朝鲜，我们也很难想象中国会愿意解决朝鲜半岛危机所带出的更深入问题：中国越来越以一个民族主义的方向去描述自己的利益和命运，它似乎对重用自己在上世纪应对危机的方法更感兴趣，而不是利用最新的情况用作机会来塑造新的方案。
"By Owen Amos and Hideharu TamuraBBC News Because the Yokohama captain, Kazuyoshi Miura, was 53 years old. Miura's never-ending career fascinates football fans around the world. His contract extensions are reported by the BBC and CNN. He holds the Guinness record for “world’s oldest goalscorer”. Even his inclusion in the FIFA 20 computer game – after first appearing in it 24 years ago – made headlines. So who is “King Kazu” and why does he keep playing? What’s the secret to a football career that is at least 15 years longer than average? The story, he told the BBC, began with the 1970 World Cup, Pele, and an 8mm camera. Miura grew up in a football family in Shizuoka, where the game has long been popular. His older brother Yasutoshi also became a professional, and their father was an avid fan. “My father was in Mexico in 1970 to watch the World Cup,” Miura says, speaking via a translator. “He filmed the matches by 8mm video camera. At that time, Pele was playing, and I grew up watching the video taken by my father.” Miura was only three in 1970, but the home-made video, looping over and over, had a lasting impact. “I became a fan of Brazilian football,” he says. “From the time I was a little boy, I wanted to live as a professional player.” Miura’s father had links to Brazil and the teenager left school in Shizuoka aged 15 to move there. “At that time there was no J-League [the professional Japanese league that began in 1993],” Miura recalls. “So there was no way of becoming a professional soccer player in Japan.” He signed for Juventus, a professional team in Sao Paulo, but it was not an easy start. He lived in a dormitory with other youth players, aged 15 to 20, and spoke little Portuguese. “I couldn’t understand the language, and the customs were different, so naturally I felt lonely,” Miura says. “The first three months was really hard.” But he was determined to improve. He threw himself into training sessions. He learned Portuguese. He made friends. He had to succeed in Brazil because, really, there was no Plan B. When asked whether there was an alternative career, had football not worked out, he pauses. “I don’t have any idea,” he says, eventually. “All I wanted was to be a football player. So this is the hardest question to answer.” In 1986, three years after moving to Brazil, Miura signed for Santos, where Pele – star of those 8mm videos – played most of his career. He stayed in Brazil, at a number of clubs, for more than four years. He returned to Japan in 1990, a bona fide superstar. In 1993, the J-League’s first season, Miura was named most valuable player – beating, among others, England’s Gary Lineker. In 1994, he moved on loan to Genoa in Italy, becoming the first Japanese player in Serie A. He needed surgery after his first game – he hit the back of Italian legend Franco Baresi’s head – scored only one goal, and stayed only one season. But his spell in Italy only increased his status back home. “It’s hard to overstate his importance,” says Sean Carroll, a football journalist in Japan. “He is intrinsically tied up with the birth and development of professional football in Japan… he has achieved a god-like status, in some ways I guess similar to [Diego] Maradona in Argentina,"" Carroll says. “There is a whole generation of professional players, maybe even two generations now, who cite him as their role model when they were kids.” But why is he still playing? In 2005 – aged 38 – Miura signed for his current club, Yokohama FC, in the Japanese second division. He became a key player, playing 39 times as the team won promotion to the top division in 2006. Although they were relegated after one season, Miura remained a regular for Yokohama in the second tier well into his 40s. In 2016, he played 20 times, scoring twice. He was 49 years old. Miura rarely gets injured (except when running into Franco Baresi) and is renowned for his fitness regime. He speaks to the BBC after training, in a dressing gown, holding an ice pack to his leg. “For sure, it takes me longer than the younger players to recover,” he says. “But even though it’s very hard, I have this passion of wanting to play, so that keeps me going.” And, as well as his fitness, there’s another reason for Miura’s ultra-long career – his popularity. In 1998, just before Japan’s first World Cup, Miura was dropped from the squad, adding a layer of sympathy to his superstar status. But more importantly, he is known for simply being a nice person. The editor of J Soccer magazine, Alan Gibson, first met Miura in 1993, and went on to referee him a number of times in friendly games when he played for Vissel Kobe in the early 2000s. “He was a gentleman on the field – I really enjoyed refereeing him,” says Gibson. “Everyone loves him. Although he’s ‘the King’, he didn’t make the World Cup. And, as he played for Yokohama for so long, he hasn’t recently won a championship with a team everyone hates.” That popularity makes more people watch Yokohama games – “If they know he’s playing, an extra 3,000 or 4,000 people turn up,” says Gibson – and encourages a number of sponsors. That links to a final reason for Miura’s longevity: the respectful – or perhaps sentimental – streak than runs through Japanese society. One coach, while praising Miura, tells the BBC that “King Kazu” has become a “panda bear” at Yokohama – that is, a rare, much-loved curiosity, rather than a serious player. Despite playing twice in the League Cup, he has not played in the league this season, and only played three times last year. Sean Carroll says Miura's experience is important in the Yokohama dressing room, but agrees that his ultra-long career says something about Japanese society more widely. “Hierarchy is incredibly important in Japan anyway, but when you’ve contributed as much as Kazu, he pretty much has a contract as long as he wants one,” he says. “The idea of him ‘working hard’ and ‘acting as an inspiration’ is oft-repeated by fans and the media – fulfilling a kind of ‘anything-is-possible’ fairy tale. Which again, reflects Japanese culture at large.” Even that, though, doesn’t quite explain Miura’s longevity. After all, it’s not the supporters, or the sponsors, who push through the pain barrier, day in, day out, aged 53. Miura is often asked what the “secret” is to his career. He insists there is no secret – other than hard work and dedication. But perhaps the secret comes in the answer to the final question. Does 53-year-old Kazu, training every day in Yokohama, enjoy kicking a ball as much as the 15-year-old boy who flew to Brazil with a few words of Portuguese and head full of dreams? “Yes, I still enjoy playing football – every moment,” he says. “Really, I enjoy it even more than when I was in Brazil.”",日本联赛杯第二轮比赛通常不是什么国际性新闻，不过上个月甲级球队横滨FC和鸟栖砂岩对阵时，却在世界多个地方成为新闻。为什么？,2020年2月J联赛新赛季开始时的三浦知良。 因为横滨的队长，是53岁的三浦知良。 三浦那个永远未结束的职业生涯在全世界足球迷眼中特别引人入胜。他的每一次续约会被BBC和CNN报道。他保持着“世界最年长进球者”的吉尼斯世界纪录（Guinness record，健力士纪录）。 甚至他出现在电子游戏“FIFA20”都能成为新闻——他在24年前就第一次出现在那款游戏里了。 所以外号“国王”（King Kazu）的他是谁？为什么他要一直踢下去？这个比一般球员长了至少15年的足球生涯，背后的秘密是什么？ 他接受BBC访问时表示，故事是从1970年世界杯、贝利（Pele，比利）和一台8毫米摄影机开始的。 三浦知良在静冈县的一个足球世家长大。这项运动在那个地方流行已久。他的哥哥三浦泰年也曾是一名职业球员，他们的父亲则是一个狂热的足球迷。 “我父亲在墨西哥看了1970年世界杯，”三浦知良通过一名翻译说，“他用一台8毫米摄影机拍下了比赛。当时贝利在踢球，而我是看着我父亲拍的影片长大的。” 1970年时，三浦知良才三岁，但是当时那些反复播放的自制影片，长久地留在了记忆中。 “我成了一名巴西足球的拥趸，”他说，“从小时候开始，我就想成为一名职业球员。” 三浦知良的父亲在巴西有人脉，于是三浦知良在15岁时就从静冈退了学，前去巴西。 “当时还没有J联赛（日本的职业足球联赛从1993年开始），”三浦回忆说，“所以当时并没有办法在日本成为一名职业球员。” 他在圣保罗签约了一支叫做尤文图斯（Juventus）的的球队，不过一开始并不容易。他和一群15-20岁的年轻球员一起住在一个宿舍里，基本不太会说葡萄牙语。 “我听不懂那里的语言，而且文化习惯也不一样，所以很自然地，我感到孤单，”三浦知良说，“头三个月真的很艰难。” 但是他很有决心要进步。他将自己整个身心投入到训练当中。他学习葡萄牙语，交不同的朋友，他必须要在巴西成功，因为根本就没有第二选择。被问到如果足球这条路走不通的话，他会不会有第二条职业道路时，他停顿了一下。 终于开口时，他说：“我没有想过，我只想做一名足球员。所以这个问题是最难回答的。” 35至今參加職業足球比賽賽季總數 89次代表日本國家隊 55次為日本隊入球 4個大洲的職業足球曾有他身影 163個各級J聯賽入球 1986年，在移居巴西三年后，三浦签约了桑托斯（Santos，山度士），那是贝利——那个8毫米摄影机里的主角——职业生涯里大部分时间所效力的球队。他留在了巴西度过了四年多，效力过一系列不同的俱乐部。 他在1990年回到日本，这时的他在自己的祖国已经是一个货真价实的巨星。1993年，J联赛的第一个赛季，三浦知良当选最有价值球员——压倒了包括英格兰前国脚加里·莱因克尔（Gary Lineker，连尼加）在内的其他球星。 1994年，他以租借形式加盟意大利的热那亚，成为第一个在意大利甲级联赛效力的日本球员。他在第一场比赛之后就因为撞到意大利传奇球星弗朗科·巴雷西（Franco Baresi，巴里斯）的头而需要做手术。他只踢了一个赛季，进了一个球。不过，他在意大利的经历令他在家乡的地位继续提升。 “他的重要性无可估量，”在日本工作的足球记者肖恩·卡罗尔（Sean Carroll）说。 “他和日本职业足球的诞生和发展实质上是连在一起的……他得到了某种神一样的地位，某程度上我猜是和马拉多纳（Diego Maradona，马纳当拿）在阿根廷的地位相似，”卡罗尔说。 “有整整一代的职业球员，或者甚至两代，都会说他是他们小时候的榜样。” 可是，为什么他还在继续踢呢？ 三浦知良去热那亚效力是由赞助商资助的——他在意大利上场21次，打入一球。 2005年，38岁的三浦知良与现在的球队、当时在日本乙级联赛的横滨FC签约。他成为了核心球员，在球队成功在2006年闯入顶级联赛的赛季里，他出场39次。 虽然他们在一个赛季之后再度降级，但是三浦还是继续留下效力处在二级联赛里的横滨，踢到40多岁。2016年，他出场20次，打入两球。 他当时已经49岁。 三浦知良很少受伤（除了和巴雷西相撞的那一次之外），而且是以坚持体能训练项目著称。他在一次训练之后，披着晨衣接受BBC访问的，手里扶着一个冰袋压着腿上。 “肯定的，我恢复体力需要的时间比年轻球员长，”他说，“但即使很困难，我还是有这种热情想要踢球，这一点令我一直向前。” 而且，除了他的体力之外，三浦知良的超长职业生涯当中还有一个因素——他的知名度。 1998年，就在日本第一次闯进世界杯之前，三浦知良被剔除出国家队名单，令这名超级巨星身上多了一份悲情的色彩；但是更重要的是，他一直都是众所周知的好好先生。 《J Soccer》杂志主编阿兰·吉布森（Alan Gibson）在1993年第一次遇见三浦知良，之后在三浦于2000年代初效力神户胜利船（Vissel Kobe）期间，在一些友谊赛中作为裁判执法过他的比赛。 “他在球场上是一名绅士——我真的很喜欢当他的裁判，”吉布森说。 “所有人都爱他。虽然他是‘国王’，虽然他没能踢世界杯；而且，他在横滨效力如此长的时间，他跟着一支所有人都讨厌的球队，近年都没有赢得过一项冠军。” 他的知名度吸引了更多的人去看横滨的比赛——“如果他们知道他会上场，就会多3000至4000人到场，”吉布森说——这又吸引了一些赞助商。 这就带出了三浦这个漫长职业生涯的最后一个原因：贯穿在日本社会当中的那种毕恭毕敬——甚或是易动感情——的情怀。 一名教授在称赞三浦知良的同时向BBC表示，“国王”在横滨已经成为了像“大熊猫”一样的吉祥物——就是一个稀奇罕见、备受爱戴的人，而不是一个那么重要的球员。虽然他在联赛杯里面上场两次，但是他在今年以来还没有在联赛中出过场，去年也只是踢了三场比赛。 1992年亚洲杯，三浦知良代表日本国家队在对阵阿联酋的比赛中；日本最后赢得那一届杯赛的冠军。 肖恩·卡罗尔说，三浦知良的经验在横滨的更衣室里是非常重要的，但是也同意，三浦超长的职业生涯反映了日本社会某些更广大的东西。 “无论如何，等级在日本的重要性是难以想象的，但是当你像三浦知良这样贡献良多的时候，基本上就是他想要一份合同就会有，”他说。 “球迷和媒体经常提起的是他‘努力’和‘用行动鼓舞人们’，这成就了某种‘凡事皆有可能’的神话，这也反映了日本的大体文化。” 不过，即便如此，也不能就此解释三浦知良的职业足球寿命。毕竟，在53岁之龄日复一日地承受艰苦训练的，不是球迷，也不是赞助商。 三浦知良经常被问到，他职业生涯中的“秘诀”是什么。他坚持说，除了努力和投入之外，没有秘诀。但是，在最后一个问题的回答当中，那个秘密浮现了。 53岁每天在横滨进行训练的三浦知良，仍然像那个只会说几个葡萄牙语单词却怀着满脑子梦想飞往巴西的15岁小男孩一样，那么爱踢球吗？ “是的，我仍然享受踢足球的每一刻，”他说，“真的，我甚至比在巴西的时候更享受。”
"Police said they arrested the man in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, following searches. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi killed 22 - including children - and injured 64 at an Ariana Grande concert on Monday. The bomber's father, Ramadan, and younger brother, Hashem, have been detained by militia in Libya. His older brother, Ismail, was detained in Chorlton, south Manchester, on Tuesday. The fifth UK arrest on Wednesday - in Wigan - involved a man who was carrying a package that is now being ""assessed"", police said. Eyewitness Connor Britton told the BBC the man had been held by ""undercover armed police"". He said workers in his office had been told to stay inside and lock their windows, and that a red package had been ""moved to a clear part of the street"". The UK terror threat level is now at its highest level of ""critical"", meaning more attacks may be imminent. Military personnel are being deployed to protect key sites after the UK's terror threat level was raised on Tuesday night. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""[Monday's attack] was more sophisticated than some of the attacks we've seen before, and it seems likely - possible - that [Abedi] wasn't doing this on his own."" Meanwhile, the New York Times has obtained photos which it says were gathered by UK authorities at the scene of the attack, including the remnants of a backpack, nuts and screws, and a device identified as a ""possible detonator"". The paper says the alleged evidence suggests ""a powerful, high-velocity charge, and a bomb in which its shrapnel was carefully and evenly packed"". UK authorities have reacted with anger to the publication of the leaked pictures. One Whitehall source told the BBC there was ""disbelief and astonishment"" across Whitehall. A counter terrorism policing spokesperson said it was a breach of trust that undermined relationships with ""trusted intelligence, law enforcement and security partners around the world"" and undermined the confidence of victims, witnesses and their families. ""This damage is even greater when it involves unauthorised disclosure of potential evidence in the middle of a major counter terrorism investigation,"" the spokesperson added. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said that the bomber is thought to have been a ""mule"", using a device built by someone else. In other developments: What's happening with the investigation? Seven people were arrested in the UK since Monday night, including Abedi's older brother Ismail, 23. He has since been released without charge. Younger brother Hashem, 20, was held by militia in the Libyan capital Tripoli, as was their father. Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, Greater Manchester Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: ""I think it's very clear that this is a network that we are investigating. ""And as I've said, it continues at a pace. There's extensive investigations going on and activity taking place across Greater Manchester, as we speak."" As part of their investigation, police raided a block of flats near Manchester Piccadilly station in the city centre, requiring them to carry out a controlled explosion and briefly close the railway line. Police carried out another controlled explosion in the early hours of Thursday morning at an address in the Moss Side area of Manchester. Anyone with information about the attack can call the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789321. Who are the victims? The victims include 14-year-old Sorrell Leczkowski, from Leeds, whose grandmother is critically injured in hospital. Others who died are mother-of-three Michelle Kiss, Nell Jones, 14, eight-year-old Saffie Roussos, Alison Howe, Lisa Lees, Jane Tweddle-Taylor, 51, Martyn Hett, 29, and Olivia Campbell, 15. Kelly Brewster, 32, John Atkinson, 28, Georgina Callander - thought to be 18 - and Marcin and Angelika Klis, a Polish couple from York, have also been named. South Shields couple Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19 have been named among the dead. Family members paid tribute to the teenagers and in a statement issued by police said: ""They wanted to be together forever and now they are"". Some of the victims had been making their way outside at the end of the gig when Abedi detonated his ""nuts-and-bolts"" bomb. Others had been waiting in the foyer to pick up children and family. A serving Cheshire police officer - off-duty at the time - was also among those killed. She has not yet been named. The BBC understands her partner is critically ill and his two children were injured. Of the 64 injured, 20 are in a critical condition. Twelve of them are children. Mr Hopkins said the families of all those injured had been contacted. Who was the attacker? Salman Abedi is understood to have been a 22-year-old born in Manchester to Libyan parents, and a former University of Salford student. He attended Burnage Academy for Boys in Manchester between 2009 and 2011, and The Manchester College until 2013. Hamid El-Said, who worked for the UN on tackling radicalisation and now works at Manchester Metropolitan University, said Abedi had had a ""really bad relationship"" with his family and his parents had tried but failed to keep him on the ""right path"". ""Eventually he was doing very bad at his university, at his education, and he didn't complete, and they tried to take him back to Libya several times. He had difficulties adjusting to European lifestyle,"" he said. A former classmate of Abedi's told the BBC that he was a ""very jokey lad"" but also ""very short tempered"" and would get angry at ""the littlest thing"". The man, who did not want to be identified, said Abedi had hung around ""the wrong crowd and was very, very gullible"". Before leaving Burnage Academy in 2011, Abedi had become ""more and more religious"", the man added. A Muslim community worker, who did not want to be identified, has told the BBC that two people who had known Abedi at college had made separate calls to a hotline to warn the police about his extremist views. He said they had been worried that Abedi was ""supporting terrorism"" and he had expressed the view that ""being a suicide bomber was ok"". The calls are thought to have been made five years ago, he added. What does a 'critical' threat level mean? Prime Minister Theresa May said soldiers are being placed at Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, embassies and the Palace of Westminster to support armed police in protecting the public. Military personnel may also be seen at other events over the coming weeks, such as concerts, Mrs May said, in what she is calling a ""proportionate and sensible response"". Home Secretary Amber Rudd said 984 troops had been deployed in the first instance. Up to 3,800 are available. She said she expected the raising of the threat level to critical to be temporary, adding that the bomber had been known ""up to a point"" by the intelligence services. The highest threat level has been reached only twice before: in 2006 during an operation to stop a plot to blow up transatlantic airliners, and a year later when security chiefs were hunting for the men who tried to bomb a London nightclub and attacked Glasgow Airport. The Metropolitan Police says it has increased its presence across London, and freed up an extra 1,000 armed officers to patrol crowded places, key sites and transport hubs across the UK. The Palace of Westminster has been closed to the public following police advice, and will not re-open until further notice, its website said.","曼彻斯特竞技场怀疑自杀袭击事件发生后，英国警方已逮捕第七名犯罪嫌疑人，警方并称在调查爆炸案幕后的""网络""。","The sixth person to be held in the UK following Monday's deadly attack, was arrested in Wigan 在沃里克郡（Warwickshire）搜查之后，英国警方在纳尼顿（Nuneaton）逮捕一名男子。 曼彻斯特竞技场怀疑自杀袭击事件嫌疑人为22岁的萨勒曼·拉马丹·阿贝迪（Salman Ramadan Abedi）。 周一晚（5月22日）发生在英国曼彻斯特竞技场的怀疑自杀攻击事件导致22人死亡，64人受伤。 怀疑自杀袭击事件嫌疑人阿贝迪的父亲拉马丹（Ramadan）和弟弟哈希姆（Hashem）已在利比亚被当地民兵扣押。 怀疑自杀袭击事件嫌疑人阿贝迪20岁的弟弟哈希姆在利比亚的黎波里被拘押。 阿贝迪的兄长伊斯梅尔（Ismail）在曼彻斯特南部的乔尔顿被拘捕（左图）；阿贝迪的父亲拉马丹（Ramadan）在利比亚的黎波里被民兵扣押（右图，“脸书”照片）。 星期二，阿贝迪的兄长伊斯梅尔（Ismail）在曼彻斯特南部的乔尔顿被拘捕。 英国警方说，第五名嫌疑人星期四在威根被捕，他当时身上拿着一个包。 目击者布莱顿对BBC表示，这名男子是被""便衣特警""拘捕。 大曼彻斯特警察局长伊恩·霍普金斯周三下午说，警方正在对袭击案幕后的网络展开调查。 他说，在大曼彻斯特，警方正展开广泛的调查。 英国首相特里莎·梅此前表示，英国恐怖威胁级别已经提高至最高的""危急""（critical）级别，意味着进一步的袭击可能迫在眉睫。 特里莎·梅首相说，政府将在重要的公共地点部署军队士兵，协助武装警察保护公众。 英国内政大臣安珀·路德表示，周一的袭击比之前的一些恐怖袭击复杂，而且有可能阿贝迪并非单独犯案。 与此同时，美国《纽约时报》网站公开了声称是英国当局在曼彻斯特袭击案发现场收集的政物照片，包括背囊的残余部分，以及疑似炸弹引爆管。 美国《纽约时报》网站公开了声称是英国当局在曼彻斯特袭击案现场的政物照片。 《纽约时报》说，有关证据显示，这枚炸弹的""钉子被小心均匀地包装""。 英国当局对《纽约时报》公布外泄的图片感到愤怒。 英国政府消息人士对BBC表示，白厅人士对此感到""难以置信和惊讶""。 反恐警察发言人说，美方此举违背信任，破坏了与""值得信赖的世界各地情报、执法和安全合作伙伴""的关系，并破坏了受害者、证人及其家属的信心。 发言人补充说：""在大规模的反恐调查案进行当中，未经授权地公布潜在的证据，这种损害更加之大""。 Soldiers on the streets: How security is being stepped up around the country 阿贝迪以前的同学形容说，阿贝迪脾气爆燥，容易轻信他人。 谁是犯罪嫌疑人阿贝迪? 据BBC了解， 阿贝迪1994年新年除夕出生在曼彻斯特，但是来自利比亚难民家庭。 阿贝迪的父母早年作为难民逃离利比亚，抵达英国。 阿贝迪至少有三位兄弟姐妹，包括出生在伦敦的大哥、出生在曼彻斯特的弟弟和妹妹。 他在曼城当地上的小学，本人是曼联球迷，并曾在面包坊工作。 2009年至2011年，阿贝迪在曼彻斯特伯纳基男子学院上学；后来在曼彻斯特学院上学，直到2013年。 在曼彻斯特都市大学工作的哈米德·埃尔萨德表示，阿贝迪""与家人的关系真的很差""，他的父母曾努力使他走正道，但却以失败告终。 埃尔萨德说，阿贝迪“后来在大学的成绩很差，在学习方面一塌糊涂，没有完成学业，家人曾多次带他前往利比亚。阿贝迪在适应欧洲生活方式方面有困难。” 阿贝迪以前的一位同学对BBC表示，阿贝迪脾气爆燥，常因小事发怒，择友不慎，容易轻信他人。 这位同学说，2011年离开伯纳基学院之前，阿贝迪已变得越来越信仰宗教。 一位不愿透露姓名的穆斯林社区工作人员表示，阿贝迪的两名前校友曾分别致电警方热线电话，警告当局此人有极端主义思想。 这名穆斯林社区工作人员说，他们担心阿贝迪""支持恐怖主义""，因为阿贝迪曾表示，""当自杀炸弹攻击者没问题""。 他补充说，两人致电警方热线大约是五年前的事。"
"The 25-year-old eldest granddaughter of Emperor Akihito will become engaged to law firm worker Kei Komuro, also 25, whom she met while studying together. Japan's imperial law requires a princess to leave the royal family after marrying a commoner. The move is expected to reignite debate on royal succession, with the emperor also possibly abdicating soon. Ten things about Japan's emperor Princess Mako and Kei Komuro met in 2012 at a restaurant, when they were both studying at the International Christian University in Tokyo. What happens now? The Imperial Household told local media that plans were under way for the princess's engagement. The engagement will only be official after a ceremonial exchange of gifts, local media said. Public broadcaster NHK said the wedding is expected to take place next year. Asked about their engagement plans, Mr Komuro on Wednesday was quoted as saying: ""Now is not the time for me to comment, but I want to speak at the right time."" Has this ever happened before? Yes, Princess Mako's aunt Princess Sayako married a commoner in 2005 - the first time a Japanese royal became a commoner. Her wedding to an urban planner for the Tokyo city government, was described as a low key event. And Sayako was left to adjust to her more humble surrounding. She moved into a one-bedroom apartment, had to learn how to drive, shop in a supermarket and buy furniture. Princess Sayako is the only daughter of Emperor Akihito. How does this affect the royal family? Emperor Akihito, 83, hinted last August that he wanted to stand down, saying his age could interfere with his duties. No Japanese emperor has abdicated for two centuries and the law currently does not allow it, but Japan is currently considering legal changes to allow the emperor to abdicate. However, the new legislation is expected to leave unchanged a males-only succession law - which has been at the centre of debate for many years. Because of that law there are only four heirs to the Chrysanthemum Throne: Akihito's sons Crown Prince Naruhito and Prince Fumihito, Prince Hisahito (Fumihito's son) and the emperor's younger brother, Prince Masahito. After news of Princess Mako's upcoming engagement broke, Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying: ""There is no change in our view to proceed with consideration of steps to ensure stable imperial succession.""",日本皇室成员真子公主（Princess Mako）将和一位平民结婚，她也将因此失去皇室地位。,"25岁的真子公主是日本明仁天皇第一个孙女以及天皇次子文仁亲王的长女，她是天皇四个孙辈中第一个订婚的。她将在近期和同为25岁的大学同学、现在一家律所工作的小室圭（Kei Komuro）订婚。 根据日本《皇室典范》的规定，真子与普通市民结婚后将失去皇族身份。 明仁天皇的长女清子于2005年""下嫁""给一位东京公务员。明仁天皇的侄女典子“下嫁”给一位神社主持的儿子。两人都因婚姻失去了皇族身份。 2016年11月28日，日本天皇家族新年合影。后排左一为真子公主。 真子公主和小室圭于2012年在日本国际基督教大学就读时相识。 小室圭曾经以""海王子""的名义推销日本旅游。 他在回应媒体关于订婚计划的提问时表示，""现在还不是谈论这件事情的时候，但我会在适当时候说话。"" 小室圭和真子公主是大学同学，他曾经以“海王子”名义为日本旅游促销。 日本宫内厅向美国CNN确认，两人的订婚方案正在制订中。 83岁的日本明仁天皇最近表示正在考虑修改法律，以允许天皇退位。 在过去200年里，没有日本天皇退位。日本现行法律也不允许这种事情发生。但新的立法可能改变一些皇室传统，包括只允许男性担任天皇的条款。 日本内阁官房长官菅义伟（Yoshihide Suga）对路透社表示，""为了保证皇室继承的平稳，现在还没有考虑进行任何改变。"" 《日经新闻》引用宫内厅长官山本信一郎的话称，""想在两人做好了准备的情况下发布订婚消息""。但正式发布的时间尚未确定。 山本表示，真子公主的父亲文仁亲王夫妇已经同意了婚约，天皇和皇后也已知晓。据相关人士称，真子5年前经熟人介绍认识了小室圭并交往至今。 日本现有四位皇室继承人，按照顺位分别为，天皇儿子、皇太子德仁亲王（Crown Prince Naruhito），天皇儿子文仁亲王（Prince Fumihito），文仁亲王的儿子悠仁亲王（Prince Hisahito），以及天皇弟弟正仁亲王（Prince Masahito）。 清子公主是第一位与平民结婚的日本皇室成员，她在2005年嫁给了一位东京的公务员。 ""平民公主"" 不仅选择与平民订婚，真子公主的成长历程也体现出和传统相异的平民思维。 真子公主（左）和佳子公主（右）。两人都是天皇明仁次子文仁亲王的女儿。真子将和一位日本平民订婚，也将在婚后失去皇室身份和待遇。 真子公主现年25岁，2010年她一反皇室传统，成为首位到国际基督教大学读书的日本皇族，其后低调赴英国留学，2016年起于东京大学博物馆担任研究员。据英国《独立报》2015年9月的报道，真子公主于莱斯特大学（University of Leicester）攻读有关艺术博物馆的硕士课程。 出生于1991年10月5日的小室圭，2014年6月毕业于日本国际基督教大学，目前在东京的奥野综合法律事务所从事外国法律共同业务，目前尚未取得律师资格。 台湾《自由时报》报道称，网上曾流传一则消息，有日本外务省官员乘坐经济舱前往英国时，遇到真子公主坐在他后方。日本皇室评论家称，真子公主外游时经常坐经济客位，并非稀奇事。还有日本杂志拍到真子公主与男性友人外出时，跟平民一样乘搭电车。 放弃皇室身份意味什么？ 今年2月，真子公主（左二）、佳子公主（左一）和父母一起在机场为出访的天皇送行。 最直接简单的表述是，她将失去皇室待遇。具体来说有哪些呢？ 虽然每个皇室成员离开皇室后的经历有所不同，但可以从现任天皇明仁的长女清子内亲王（日本称公主为内亲王）的经历来观察。"
"The agent, known by the alias Jack King, infiltrated a group of pro-German activists in south-east England in a previously unknown wartime operation. His undercover work led to the identification of hundreds of people willing to pass secrets to the enemy. Files in the National Archives describe King as a ""genius"" at his work. In 1942, King - also referred to as SR in the files - met Marita Perigoe, described as a ""crafty and dangerous woman"" of Swedish and German origin. Despite being married to a member of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists, she had no time for the group and regarded them as ""insufficiently extreme"". MI5 said of her: ""She was found to be so violently anti-British and so anxious to do anything in her power to help the enemy that it was felt that special attention should be paid to her."" It went on to say she was not a ""neurotic nor feminine type; she is masterful and a somewhat masculine woman"". ""Both in appearance and mentality she can be described as an arrogant hun."" King managed to convince her that he was a representative of the Gestapo looking for people who were ""100% loyal to the Fatherland"" and could be relied on in the event of an invasion. He exploited the group's taste for the cloak-and-dagger aspects of espionage work by offering them invisible ink for secret communications and arranging meetings in the basement of an antiques shop. MI5 regarded some members of the group as unstable but warned they were still dangerous. Hilda Leech was ""unstable and neurotic"" and was trying to pass on reports of highly secret research on jet aircraft, while astrologer Edgar Whitehead - a ""bit of a mystery man"" - was passing on information about secret trials on an amphibious tank. MI5 drew up plans to issue members with special badges to be worn in the event of an invasion - supposedly to identify them as friends to the Germans but in fact to enable them to be swiftly rounded up by the police. By the end of the war, Perigoe was one of six agents working directly to King - all but one of them British. MI5 estimated the number of their contacts who had been the subject of King's intelligence reports ran ""certainly to scores and probably to hundreds"". In other declassified files released by the National Archives, it emerged that English actor Michael Redgrave met Guy Burgess, one of the Cambridge spies, while his theatre group toured Moscow. The meeting in 1958 with his old friend from Cambridge University proved to be of interest to MI5, which was desperate to find out all it could about what was said. Burgess, who had fled to Russia seven years earlier, turned up drunk at the theatre where Redgrave was starring in Hamlet. 'Fine gossips' But the two had lunch together the following day at Burgess' flat, provided by the KGB after his defection. The British ambassador at the time said Redgrave had not been very communicative about the meeting and had not consulted the embassy about it beforehand. Burgess, however, wrote a letter home to his mother - intercepted by MI5 - delighting in the ""fine gossips"" shared and gushing over Redgrave's acting. ""It's certainly the best Hamlet I've ever seen - better than Gielgud, better than Olivier, much better than Paul Schofield.""",新公布的档案显示，二战期间英国军情五处（MI5）一名卧底情报员成功监控英国的纳粹同情者的网络。,"英国国家档案局公布的二战情报资料。 这名化名杰克·金（Jack King）的情报员假冒自己与德国盖世太保（Gestapo, 秘密国家警察）有联系，渗透进入英格兰东南部的一个亲德国活动分子的组织中。 他的卧底工作导致数百名试图向敌人提供机密情报的英国人被指认出来。 英国国家档案局（National Archives）的资料说，杰克·金在情报工作上展露了“天才”表现。 情报工作 1942年，杰克·金认识了马里塔·佩里戈（Marita Perigoe），她是瑞典和德国后裔，嫁给了一名英国人。 MI5资料显示，“据知她非常痛恨英国，愿意尽自己一切所能帮助敌人，有必要特别注意她”。 资料还说，“她的外表和内心都不特别女性化，颇具威严，甚至有点男性化。” 杰克·金对她进行工作，让她相信自己是潜伏在英国寻找“100%效忠祖国”的盖世太保代表。 活动分子 杰克·金利用玛丽塔·佩里格的关系，渗透进入了她和其他亲德国活动分子的组织中。 这个小团体一共有六名成员，除了佩里格之外其余都是英国裔。 其中有人试图向德国提供高度机密的喷气机的研究报告，还有人向德国提供两栖坦克的秘密试验资料。 杰克·金向他们派发特别的徽章，让他们相信在德国占领英国后可以用来识别他们的敌后卧底身份，但其实这些徽章是让英国警察能迅速逮捕他们。 MI5相信，通过这六人所掌握的名单绝对超过数十人，甚至数百人以上。 （编译：友义 责编：李莉）"
"BBC TrendingWhat's popular and why Each year during summer solstice, it's thought that 10,000 dogs are cooked and eaten in Yulin, in Guangxi province in southern China, as part of the city's yearly dog meat festival. Although it's not illegal to eat dog meat in China, opinion is divided on how deep the ""tradition"" really runs. On Chinese social media in recent years, the Yulin Festival has become a focus for the large numbers of animal lovers - mostly within China - who are against it. But this year, the reaction has gone global. Since May, almost a quarter of a million tweets have been posted using the hashtag #StopYulin2015, with most of the activity coming from the UK, the US and Australia. One of the loudest voices has been the US animal welfare group Duo Duo, whose change.org petition calling for the cancellation of the event has received more than 200,000 signatures. The group's campaign video on YouTube has been viewed more than 130,000 times. ""I went to a slaughter house in Yulin a few days ago. The dogs and cats were wearing collars and of different sizes and breeds. They were very friendly,"" says Duo Duo founder Andrea Gung. ""Dogs are man's best friend. To kill more than 10,000 of them in one day is wrong,"" she says. Activists have also raised health concerns - although the meat is traditionally seen as having health benefits, campaigners claim the dogs transported into Yulin come from the black market and could be diseased. ""The consumer thinks they're safe to eat but they're not,"" says Gung. Duo Duo has intentionally targeted a Western audience with its social media campaign, rather than campaigning within China, as it says it doesn't want to interfere with the activities of local activists. ""The main thing we have done is made people in Yulin realise that their tradition is something from the past, that is perceived negatively from the outside world,"" says Gung. The conversation about Yulin has been mostly negative on western social media, but the chatter has been more mixed on the Chinese network Weibo. A page dedicated to discussing ""Yulin Dog Day"" has generated almost 350,000 comments. Many Weibo users expressed concern at the idea of eating dogs and shared loving images of their pets. But others accused animal welfare activists of hypocrisy and said local values in Guangxi Province should be respected. So just how widespread is the eating of dog meat in China? ""Although meat eating has increased in China over the past 30 years as the country becomes more affluent, dog meat is really not widely available,"" says Sam Geall, executive editor of the China Dialogue environmental blog. ""In the 15 years that I have been travelling to China I have never once been offered dog meat."" Some have even claimed that the Yulin Dog Festival and similar events are in fact designed to draw in international tourists. ""It's common that local tourist administrators will capitalise on elements of their past to attract revenue and tourism,"" Geall says. But with increasing numbers of middle-class Chinese owning pets, criticism of the practice within China is growing fast. ""The perception of dog-meat eating has changed because of social media,"" says Geall. ""Over the past five years there has been a growth in the number of domestic animal welfare groups using Chinese social media to campaign against the consumption of dog meat.""

"The seven are among 14 indicted on corruption charges in a US inquiry, the US Department of Justice said. The second criminal case was launched by Swiss prosecutors into the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, to be held in Russia and Qatar respectively. But Fifa says it plans to go ahead with an election for president as planned. Incumbent president Sepp Blatter, who is seeking a fifth term, was not one of the seven officials arrested. Fifa also said there would be no rerun of the World Cup bidding processes for 2018 and 2022. Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein of Jordan - Mr Blatter's rival for the Fifa presidency - said ""we cannot continue with the crisis in Fifa"". ""Fifa needs leadership that governs, guides and protects our national associations."" Fifa's Zurich headquarters has also been raided, with electronic data and documents seized. US authorities also searched the headquarters of Concacaf - the Fifa confederation for North and Central America and the Caribbean - in Miami, Florida, as part of their investigations. 'Rampant, systemic, deep-rooted' The US justice department said 14 individuals were under investigation worldwide for allegedly accepting bribes and kickbacks estimated at more than $150m (£97m) over a 24-year period. The seven arrested at a five-star hotel in Zurich on Wednesday were: Also indicted are former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner, Nicolas Leoz, Aaron Davidson, Alejandro Burzaco, Jose Margulies, and Hugo and Mariano Jinkis. ""The indictment alleges corruption that is rampant, systemic, and deep-rooted both abroad and here in the United States,"" said US Attorney General Loretta Lynch. ""Today's announcement should send a message that enough is enough,"" Acting US Attorney Kelly Currie said. Several officials have already pleaded guilty, the US Department of Justice says. These include Charles ""Chuck"" Blazer, the former head of Concacaf, who was previously on the Fifa executive committee. Mr Blazer, one of Fifa's most senior US representatives, allegedly started working with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and took part in undercover work, according to US media reports. Mr Warner reacted to the news by saying he had not been questioned and was innocent of any charges. He said that since leaving Fifa four years ago ""I have recommitted my life to the work of improving the lot of every citizen of every creed and race in this nation (Trinidad and Tobago)... I have fought fearlessly against all forms of injustice and corruption."" He added: ""The actions of Fifa no longer concern me."" Football's untouchable 'dark prince' - Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Switzerland Many have wondered how Sepp Blatter can have been in charge of Fifa for so long amid so many reports of corruption and yet remain, apparently, untouched. One Swiss newspaper jokingly called him ""the dark prince of football, the godfather, Don Blatterone"" - but no inquiry has ever revealed proof of his involvement in corruption. ""He's a survivor,"" says one member of parliament, Roland Buechel. ""Nothing ever sticks to him; there is always someone between him and the bribes."" Some old friends describe Mr Blatter as down-to-earth and open. Others who have worked with him say he is a man who resents opposition, pointing to the swift departure of Fifa colleagues who dared to question him. What emerges, finally, is a man who both critics and supporters say cannot imagine his life without Fifa, a man whose tenure as president has outlasted three marriages. But as scandal follows scandal, Mr Blatter's determination not to leave his post willingly could see him bundled unceremoniously out of the back door. Sepp Blatter: The man who won't give up 'Right track' Fifa ""welcomes the process and co-operates fully with the attorney general of Switzerland,"" spokesman Walter DeGregorio told reporters on Wednesday. ""It is certainly a difficult moment for us,"" he said, ""but this is good for Fifa. It confirms that we are on the right track"". Both Swiss and US justice officials said the indicted officials had allegedly received $150m worth of bribes from the early 1990s for football tournaments in the US and Latin America. The alleged crimes were agreed to and prepared in the US via US bank accounts, the office of the Swiss prosecutor said, adding that the Swiss authorities could immediately approve the extradition. In the second case, Swiss prosecutors opened criminal proceedings ""against persons unknown on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and of money laundering in connection with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 football World Cups"". Swiss police said they would question 10 Fifa executive committee members who participated in the votes that selected Russia and Qatar in December 2010. Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the investigation would not affect its hosting of the 2018 event, telling Associated Press: ""We've got nothing to hide.""",瑞士警方在苏黎世逮捕7 名国际足联（FIFA）高级官员后，两项涉及腐败的刑事调查已经展开。,有关方面透露，警方从巴尔拉克酒店接待处取走官员入住的房间钥匙，然后上楼进行拘捕 据美国司法部公布的信息，纽约布鲁克林联邦法院发出的控状共涉及14人、47项控罪。 其中，涉嫌腐败指控的7人是国际足球最高管理机构FIFA的现任和前任高级官员。 被捕七官 当地时间周三（5月27日）凌晨，警方在苏黎世一家5星级酒店内采取拘捕行动。 有关指控包括在过去24年中的洗钱、诈骗以及电信欺诈等罪行。涉及犯罪金额1.5亿美元。 被逮捕的七名FIFA高级官员是： Ediardp Li 爱德华多-李: 哥斯达黎加足协主席，华裔。 Jeffrey Webb 杰弗瑞-韦伯： 中北美及加勒比海足联主席以及国际足联副主席。 Eugenio Figueredo 尤金尼奥-菲格雷多: 国际足联副主席、2014年巴西世界杯的组委会成员。 Jose Maria Marin 若泽-马利亚-马林: 巴西足协主席、2014年巴西世界杯本地组委会主席。 Julio Rocha 胡里奥-罗恰：国际足联委员会成员。 Rafael Esquivel 拉法埃尔-埃斯基维尔: 委内瑞拉足协主席。 Costas Takkas 考斯塔斯-塔卡斯：中北美及加勒比海足联主席助理。 “欢迎调查” 国际足联发表声明说，FIFA欢迎任何能够帮助根除“足球界不良行为”的行动。 但它表示，准备按计划在周五选举下届主席。 国际足联各官员原定在周五（5月29日）于苏黎世举行年度会议，现任主席塞普·布拉特将寻求获得第五届任期。 被捕人员当中不包括布拉特本人。 于此同时，就2018和2022年世界的争办活动，瑞士检控方发起第二项刑事调查。 FIFA的声明说，不会重新举行2018和2022世界杯主办权的争办。 Fifa 委员会成员包括（上排左起）：拉斐尔·埃斯奎维尔、尼古拉斯·莱奥兹、杰弗里·韦伯、杰克·沃尔纳、爱德华多·李、尤金尼奥·费格雷多、何塞·马里亚·马林 消息指被捕人员多达六名，但布拉特本人不在其中 瑞士联邦司法办公室（FOJ）周三在一份声明中说，美国当局怀疑有关官员在这些年中涉嫌受贿超过1亿美元。 该办公室表示，有关人员“怀疑在1990年代至今期间受贿和收受佣金”，正在协助调查。 声明还表示，有关罪行是在双方同意的前提下发生，并且赃款是在美国境内的银行户口准备的。 苏黎世警方将在今天代表联邦司法办公室对嫌疑人进行问讯。 瑞士当局已经立即批准了美国方面的引渡申请。 （编写：白墨 责编：欧阳成）
"The EU was an anachronism which ""costs us a huge amount of money and subverts our democracy"", the Tory MP said. He insisted there were no downsides to leaving, suggesting the UK could ape Canada's trade arrangement with the EU. But David Cameron said it was wrong to say the UK could do a ""sweetheart deal"" with the EU after walking out. And in his first major intervention in the referendum debate, former prime minister Tony Blair said he was concerned by the ""fervour"" of those wanting to leave the EU but he believed that the UK would ultimately vote to remain on 23 June as it was in the national interest. Mr Johnson, one of a number of senior Conservatives to break ranks with the PM and back EU exit, told activists in Kent that the UK was the most creative country in Europe and was ""big enough and strong enough to stand on its own"". 'Mad and idealistic' If people were faced with the choice of whether to join the EU in 2016, he said they would probably regard the organisation as ""a bit mad and idealistic"", with huge ""costs and bureaucracy"" which restricted nation states' ability to make their own laws and control their borders. ""Would anyone in their right mind want to join the EU today?"" he said. ""It is 50 years old, it is going in the wrong direction. It is time for real reform. The only way to get that is to leave."" Mr Johnson said the UK could forge a new free trade deal with the EU, based on Canada's existing arrangement, and dismissed suggestions by Prime Minister David Cameron that he and other Leave campaigners were willing to sacrifice jobs and growth to achieve a measure of greater independence. ""You look at the plan to increase the efforts to prop up the single currency with an ever denser system of integration, with more and more regulation about all sorts of social and economic issues which will impact directly on this country, I think the risk is increasingly in staying in the project. ""I think the best thing we can do is show a lead, show an example and strike out for freedom."" Taking a swipe at the campaign to stay in the EU, which opponents have dubbed ""Project Fear"", Mr Johnson quoted US President Franklin Roosevelt, saying ""the only thing we have to fear is fear itself"", adding ""even fear is not that scary"". 'Tomfoolery' Canada has been cited by a number of Leave campaigners as a model for how the UK can continue to do business with the EU without being bound by rules on freedom of movement or having to contribute to its budget. It signed a free trade agreement with the EU in 2014, seven years after talk about closer economic co-operation was first mooted. The agreement, which eliminates 98% of tariffs between the two blocs, has yet to be ratified by either side but is expected to enter into force next year. Addressing activists in Wales, Mr Cameron said having to negotiate new trading rules from scratch would lead to a long period of unacceptable uncertainty for British business. ""Seven years of not knowing what the arrangements would be for trading with Europe,"" he said. ""Seven years of uncertainty for businesses wanting to invest in Britain not knowing what our relationship with Britain would be. ""They cannot be justified. They cannot be in our national interest. We should reject that out of hand."" Analysis By BBC Political Correspondent Iain Watson One of the key lines of attack from those who want to remain in the EU is what would ""out"" look like? Those who want to leave are taunted that they have no clear idea of what kind of trade deal could be struck with Brussels if we withdraw. But today Boris Johnson provided the clarity that had been requested - look across the Atlantic to Canada, he said. So now expect the focus of the Remain attack to change. Far from being grateful for the London Mayor's clarification, the terms of that deal will be denounced. Already pro-EU campaigners are pointing out just how long it took for a Canadian agreement to be struck - and are questioning if it'd be appropriate for the UK, which is far more reliant on financial services. As Boris Johnson will find out, throwing aside his comfort blanket of bluster and giving clear answers to questions in this complex EU debate comes with consequences. Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who is campaigning to Remain in the EU, said the Canadian model excluded the services industry - which accounts for a huge proportion of British employment - and accused Mr Johnson of ""playing fast and loose"" with jobs linked to EU membership. ""I am fed up with this entertainment, tomfoolery and the rest from Boris Johnson. This will affect my constituents,"" he told BBC News. And Mr Blair told Radio 4's Today that the UK's destiny was to ""lead in Europe"", warning Brexit would lead to economic instability and ""damage fundamentally"" the interests of the British people. ""I would like to see the pro-European side get out there with a bit of passion and vigour and determination and stand up for what we believe. But in a further boost for the Leave campaign, the head of the Conservative group of MEPs in the European Parliament, Syed Kamall, has said he believes the UK ""could forge a better life outside"" the EU. Mr Kamall, who also heads the pan-European ECR group, said he believed a ""fair and balanced"" immigration policy was only possible outside the EU.",伦敦市长鲍里斯·约翰逊说，英国离开欧盟对“我们大家都是双赢”。他敦促那些主张脱离欧盟的人士“坚持住，为自由而投票”。,约翰逊说，脱离欧盟后的英国前途是光明的。 约翰逊周五（3月11日）在英格兰东南的肯特郡的一家工厂做出上述表示。他说，欧盟是“历史的错误”，使英国“耗费了巨大的开支，颠覆了我们的民主”。 他还坚称，离开欧盟没有弊处，并开玩笑说“唯一需要担心的就是担心本身”。 与此同时，英国前工党领导人、前首相布莱尔则敦促支持留在欧盟的人“要拿出热情来”。 布莱尔说，他担心那些主张脱欧人的“狂热”。他说，他相信英国在6月23日的公投中最终会选择留在欧盟，并表示这符合英国的国家利益。 但是，约翰逊则说，脱离欧盟后的英国前途是光明的。他说，英国是欧洲最具创造力的国家，英国足够强大来自己站稳双脚。 他还说，欧盟已经有50年的历史，在朝着错误的方向前进。 “今天，只要大脑正常的人还会加入欧盟吗？...... 是该真正改革的时候了，唯一的方式就是离开。” 约翰逊说，英国可以遵照加拿大的模式，与欧盟建立起一种新的自由贸易协议。 但是，主张留在欧盟的一名工党议员指出，加拿大的模式不包括服务行业，而这一行业占了英国就业的一大部分。 关于英国到底是去留欧盟的问题上，英国各界人士，特别是政客们都在各抒己见，为自己的立场作宣传和鼓动活动。但最后还要看今年6月23日英国对此进行的公投结果。 （编译：凯露 责编：高毅）
"Nick RobinsonPolitical editor Few can doubt it now. It is over 100 years since a national election has been won by a party other than the Conservatives and Labour. What's more the UK Independence Party did it by winning seats not just in every region of England but in Wales and Scotland too. The impact of the result will be immediate. David Cameron will face pressure to harden up his promise to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU and to reduce immigration to win back the many Tory voters lost to UKIP. Ed Miliband will face an inquest into why before the votes of Londoners were counted Labour were only neck and neck with the Tories. And Nick Clegg will face demands to explain what can save his party if it is not a change of leadership. Alex Salmond will have to confront the fact that he failed in his aim of ensuring that Scotland was a UKIP-free zone. However, he'll use the result to urge Scots to break free from the anti European forces which topped the poll in England. Only Nigel Farage can be totally satisfied today although he knows all too well that winning a national election which he described as a ""free hit"" on the political establishment is much easier than winning a single seat in Westminster. A year ago few took that prospect seriously. They do now.",一场政坛地震？在英格兰地方选举结果揭晓后，还有些人不太相信这个说法。,英国独立党领袖法拉吉对选举结果感到完全满意。 但是，在英国全国的欧洲议会选举结果出炉之后，没有人能继续怀疑，英国政坛确已发生“地震”。 一个除保守党和工党之外的政党在一场全国性选举中获胜，这是一个世纪以来的第一次。 而且，英国独立党不仅在英格兰的每一个地区都赢得地方议会席位，而且在威尔士和苏格兰也有斩获。 这次选举的影响马上就会浮现。 因为很多保守党支持者此次转投独立党，保守党籍的英国首相卡梅伦将面临更大的压力，履行减少移民数量和就英国与欧盟的关系重新展开谈判的承诺。 工党的表现也大大落后于预期。许多党员质问工党领导人米利班德，为什么工党未能在伦敦以外地区超越保守党，而只能与其并驾齐驱？ 身为联合政府副首相的自由民主党党魁尼克·克莱格处境更为艰难，党内已经有要他下台的呼声。他将不得不说明，如果不换党魁，他有什么办法可以拯救自由民主党。 追求苏格兰独立的苏格兰首席部长萨蒙德也不好受。他此次选举的目标是力阻英国独立党打进苏格兰政坛，但是没有实现。不过，萨蒙德会利用这次的选举结果，呼吁苏格兰人选择独立，以脱离反欧盟势力甚嚣尘上的英格兰。 只有英国独立党领导人法拉吉会对选举结果感到完全满意。但他一定明白，赢得地方和欧洲议会选举和赢得英国议会席位不是一回事，后者要艰难得多。 一年以前，没有几个人相信英国独立党有可能赢得威斯敏斯特议会的议席。但现在，人们不得不认真考虑这个可能性了。 （编译：秦川 责编：尚清）
"By Matthew Price and Seren JonesBBC Beyond Today podcast Even now, a year after one of the most complex and dangerous rescues the world has ever seen, Vernon is still dealing with the trauma of those 17 desperate days. The memory of the moment he heard 12 boys and their football coach had been found alive deep underground is almost too much. The relief - and the horror of what lay ahead - come flooding back. ""The real problems started from then,"" he told the BBC Beyond Today podcast. ""We knew where they were. It's a kilometre and a half of diving. How the hell were we going to get them out alive?"" Vernon is a calm, measured man who deals well with pressure. He's been exploring underground caves for almost 50 years – a hobby that started in his native Lancashire when he was 16. ""The bug is finding a passage nobody's ever been into before - you know you're the first. Whatever footprints you leave, they're yours."" It's a hobby - not his job. But it's a pastime that made him one of just a handful of people in the world who could even attempt the impossible: saving the Wild Boars football team. Trapped by a rising flood The Wild Boars were a group of 12 boys aged 11 to 16. On Saturday 23 June 2018, after their football training, they decided to head to the Tham Luang caves for a day trip, along with their 25-year-old coach. It's a well-known local landmark and it wasn't unusual to go in at that time of year. Many like to see how far they can get into a system that runs for 10km (six miles). Some of the boys had been before. This time, they decided they would all go in together. But the team got trapped by floodwater 4km (2.5 miles) inside – and that's when Thai officials called Vernon's phone, asking him to help out. ""I know it [the cave system] better than anybody. It's been my second home. I don't have to think about where I am,"" he says. He drove to Tham Luang to meet officials and the local rescue team, but was stunned with what he found. ""[It was] organised chaos,"" he said. ""They didn't really know what to do, simply because they'd never had this situation arise before – especially involving 13 people trapped by rising floodwaters. But I knew because of the weather conditions that it was only going to get worse. ""I knew that this was going to end with someone losing their life."" Vernon took matters into his own hands. He wrote a list of the team he believed he needed for the rescue. It included Rob Harper, Rick Stanton, and John Volanthen - who were all in the UK. In an attempt to get the Britons involved, Vernon spoke to the former governor of the local province, Chiang Rai, a man named Narongsak Osatanakorn. ""I got him into a room and I basically said to him: Sir, you have one chance at this rescue."" To put the pressure on, Vernon met other government officials too. That evening Rob, Rick and John were on a plane to Thailand. 'They thought they were finding bodies' It was straight to work for the British divers. On 28 June, in appalling weather conditions, John Volanthen and Rick Stanton went to the cave for an exploratory dive. To their disbelief, they found four Thai water management officials who had been trapped in there overnight. ""Officials tried to basically ignore it ever happened because they didn't know the guys were in there. There was no logging of people going in. Nobody reported them as being lost or not around, not even their wives."" Governor Narongsak disputes this - he says he and other officials did know the four water officials were in the cave, and they had been told not to evacuate. But the unexpected rescue was a blessing in disguise. John and Rick had to dive the four officials out of the flooded caves. One of them had panicked during the rescue – and now Vernon and the team knew it would be impossible - if they were to find the boys - to dive them out of the cave without sedation. The search for the team started on 1 July, but it wasn't until the following day that they were discovered. Rick and John led the way. ""There was a horrible smell,"" Vernon remembers Rick telling him. ""Rick thought it was dead bodies. It was faeces. They thought they were finding bodies."" They'd found the team - but now they had to get them out. 'What if I decide not to do it?' To the divers' knowledge, there are only three people in the world who are both elite cave divers and anaesthetists – one in the UK, one in the US, and one in Australia. The British team got in touch with the Australian, Richard ""Harry"" Harris. ""Doc Harry said: 'It won't work'. He said 'it just won't work',"" Vernon recalls. ""Rick said to Harry: 'Well I'd like you to sleep on it overnight', and Harry said to Rick: 'What if I decide not to do it?'"" ""And Rick said: 'They all die'."" Richard Harris was almost on board. First, though, he made sure that the Australian government negotiated with the Thai government to give him immunity in case anything went wrong. For the others, British embassy officials were brought to Tham Luang to make sure they were also protected. And a plan was put together. The only way they might get the boys out alive was to sedate them. They used a mixture of ketamine, xanax, and atropine to try to dry up fluids so they wouldn't choke on their own saliva. The Wild Boars were knocked out. In some cases, they were barely breathing. Each boy was given a full face mask, then packaged up - strapped to a kind of stretcher, tied hand and foot with cable ties. The team set up a system of relays which the divers took them through - sometimes holding them close to their bodies, sometimes pushing them ahead, round the twisting s-bends of the caves. They even rigged up a pulley system on the roof of the cave and pulled them along. Vernon remembers that two of the boys started to wake up during the rescue. ""They were given a quick jab to get them unconscious (again)."" One by one, the boys were brought out. ""For us, it was a situation where four had miraculously come out alive, but we had to stay grounded - because it didn't mean that the next nine were going to come out alive,"" he says. 'None of us are heroes' By the end of day two, eight of the boys were out. Four boys and their coach were still trapped. And the conditions were getting worse. ""The rain that was forecast actually came earlier than we expected. It was 50/50 whether the dive went ahead on that morning."" But it did, just. ""One of the divers lost his dive line whilst carrying one of the precious packages, but he made it out as well. ""And literally, after the last boy was on his way out of the cave, the floodwaters just suddenly started to come through. ""What was meant to be was meant to be,"" says Vernon. In Thailand, superstition and belief in mystical powers is prevalent. Lots of places across the country are said to have various powers, especially caves. Tham Luang is associated with the myth of Nang Non, a princess who ran off with a lover and ended up taking her own life. She was supposedly pregnant with his child. The rivers inside the cave system are believed to be her blood. Today, a year on, Tham Luang has become a tourist attraction. Many Thais stop and briefly pay their respects at the shrine there - only now it is not just to the princess, but to Saman Gunan, the one person who died. He was a Thai diver who lost his life while delivering oxygen tanks just before they started the rescue effort. A statue of Saman was unveiled outside the cave complex six months after the rescue, to commemorate him. As for Vernon, he still spends a lot of his time in the area. He's been back inside the caves several times since the rescue. For him, something has changed. ""Now before I go into the cave and when I come out I have a little prayer. I give her some flowers every time I go in now and when I come out I thank her for keeping me safe, which I've never ever done before. But it's just how I feel about the whole thing. ""None of us are heroes. We've just done a job that we were asked to do and we did it to the best of what we were able to do. ""It wasn't always easy but 13 isn't an unlucky number any more, is it?"" This episode of the Beyond Today podcast is available here.",有那么一刻，弗农·昂斯沃思（Vernon Unsworth）几乎要哭了。他不说话，眼睛发红，深吸一口气，端起了茶杯。,去年，复杂危险的泰国洞穴救援持续了17天 去年，复杂危险的泰国洞穴救援持续了17天。在那次救援过去整整一年后，英国洞穴探险家昂斯沃思心中仍留有创伤。 他当然记得听到12名男孩和教练生还的那一幕，也不断想起当时的欣慰与随后的恐惧。 “真正的难题从那时开始，”他对BBC说，“我们知道他们在哪里，那个地方需要潜水1.5公里。但我们如何才能让他们活着出来呢？” 弗农·昂斯沃思 昂斯沃思冷静、谨慎，善于处理压力。他16岁时就喜欢探索洞穴，拥有将近50年探索洞穴的经验。但这仅仅是他的爱好，不是工作。 不过，这项爱好让他成为全球少数几个可以挑战这项不可能任务的人：救援野猪足球队（Wild Boars）。 洪水围困 野猪足球队总共有12名男队员，队员年龄从11岁至16岁不等。 2018年6月23日，足球队训练之后，他们决定和25岁的教练一起去泰国清莱府睡美人洞（Tham Luang）玩。睡美人洞是当地著名景点，一些队员以前也去过。这次，他们想一起去玩。 野猪足球队 但是，足球队在洞穴里被洪水围困了。泰国官员打电话给昂斯沃思，请他帮忙。“我比任何人都了解（洞穴系统），那是我的第二个家，”他说。 他开车去了睡美人洞，与当地官员和救援队伍见面，对他发现的一些情况感到震惊。 “他们真的不知道该做什么。13名被困的人被不断上涨的洪水围困，他们以前从未遇到过这样的情况。但是我知道，因为天气，情况只会恶化。”昂斯沃思说。 昂斯沃思开始介入此事。他列了一个名单，上面都是他认为应该参与救援的人，包括哈珀（Rob Harper）、斯坦顿（ Rick Stanton）、 沃伦森（ John Volanthen），他们都在英国。为了让这些英国人参与进来，昂斯沃思甚至找了泰国清莱府前最高官员纳隆萨（Narongsak Osatanakorn）。 哈珀（左）与昂斯沃思（右） “我把他带进一个房间，对他说：先生，这次救援你只有一次机会。”为了向政府施压，昂斯沃思也见了其他政府官员。 他的努力取得了成效，哈珀等三人随后到达救援现场。 弗农列出的能够参与救援的人员名单 “他们以为找到了尸体” 6月28日，在恶劣的天气下，沃伦森和斯坦顿潜入洞穴。难以置信的是，他们发现了四名泰国水务官员，他们被困了一夜。 沃伦森和斯坦顿将四名官员带出了洞穴，其中一人在救援过程中十分惊慌。这也让昂斯沃思明白，如果找到男孩们，得给他们打镇静剂才可能救出来。 搜寻工作在7月1日开始，2日他们就找到了男孩们。 男孩们一个个被带了出来 “有一股很难闻的气味，”昂斯沃思记得斯坦顿曾告诉他，“斯坦顿以为是尸体，但实际是粪便。他们以为找到了尸体。” 他们找到了足球队员和教练，但还需要救他们出去。 潜水员们说，世界上只有三个人既是经验丰富的洞穴潜水者，又是麻醉师，他们一人在英国，一人在美国，还有一个在澳大利亚。他们找到了澳大利亚人理查德·哈里斯（Richard Harris），哈里斯既有探险潜水经验又是训练有素的麻醉师。 斯坦顿曾劝说哈里斯加入救援。“斯坦顿对哈里斯说：‘我们希望你考虑一晚上’。哈里斯问：‘如果我不加入会如何’？“昂斯沃思回忆，”斯坦顿说：‘他们都会死。’“ 唯一让孩子们活着出来的方法是给他们注射镇静剂。野猪队队员们都被注射了镇静剂，在某些时候，他们几乎没有呼吸。救援人员给每个男孩戴了口罩，把他们绑在担架上，用带子绑住手脚。 昂斯沃思记得两名男孩在救援过程中开始苏醒过来，“救援人员给他们迅速打了一针，他们再次失去知觉”。 男孩们就这样一个个被带了出来。 6月28日当天，洞中的情况非常糟糕。 “我们都不是英雄” 到第二天快结束时，8个男孩获救出洞，仍有4个男孩和教练被困。 但情况更糟了。“雨比我们预期来得更早，早上继续潜水救援的几率只有50%，”昂斯沃思说。但最终他们还是能够继续。“实际上，最后一名男孩正在出洞时，洪水突然开始涌入，”他说。 在泰国，许多人信仰相信有神秘力量存在。这个国家的许多地方据称拥有这样的力量，尤其是在洞穴。 睡美人洞与泰国公主Nang Non的神话故事有关。Nang Non公主和情人私奔，最后自杀。据说她怀了情人的孩子，人们认为睡美人洞内的河流是她的血液。 泰国洞穴救援人员 救援事件一年过去，睡美人洞已经成为一个旅游景点。许多泰国人在这里停留致敬，不仅是因为传说中的这位泰国公主，还是纪念牺牲在这里的潜水员沙曼（Saman Gunan）。沙曼是一名泰国潜水员，他在运送氧气罐时丧生。救援行动6个月后，人们在洞穴外竖起了一座沙曼的雕像。 救援行动后，昂斯沃思也曾多次回到山洞。但对他来说，某些事改变了。“现在我进洞和出洞时都会祈祷，我每次进洞都会给她献花，出洞后会感谢她保护我的安全，我之前从未这样做。” “我们都不是英雄，我们只是做了别人要求的事情，并在我们的能力范围内做到了最好。” “那并不容易，但是现在看来，13不再是一个不吉利的数字了，不是吗？”
"Exports rose by 8.7% from a year ago in US dollar terms, beating estimates of 7%, after strong demand from Europe. Imports shot up by 14.8%, compared with estimates of 8.5%, thanks to purchases of processing and assembly products. Overall, China's trade surplus widened to $40.8bn (£31.5bn) from $38bn in April. Data released on Thursday also showed China's foreign exchange reserves rose by more than expected in May as tougher capital restrictions took effect. However, many analysts warn that China's growth is likely to slow gradually in coming quarters. ""Today's trade data surprised on the upside, but has not changed our overall view that real GDP growth likely peaked in the first quarter,"" investment bank Nomura said in a report. Growth risks Moody's Investors Service downgraded China's credit rating last month on concerns that its financial strength would be eroded in the coming years by rising debts. Much of China's growth since the financial crisis has come from massive government-led stimulus spending on infrastructure. But the rise of zombie factories and ghost cities, an increase in capital outflows and the collapse in commodity prices seem finally to be taking their toll. China's government has been forced to take steps to cool the property market and clamp down on speculative market activity. Investors are also worried about China's potential economic tensions with the US, its biggest trading partner after the European Union. Before entering the White House, US President Donald Trump pledged to shrink the country's gap with China. Following a meeting in April with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Florida, the two sides have agreed to 100 days of trade talks which have borne some fruit.",中国海关总署数据显示，6月份中国进出口额分别出现明显下降，加剧有关中国经济发展遇阻的担忧。,中国进出口6月均出现下降 海关总署星期三（7月10日）公布的数据显示，6月份中国进出口总值为2万亿元人民币，同比下降2%，其中出口下降幅度更是高达3.1%。 有关数据出乎分析人士预料，此前市场普遍预计中国6月份出口额会有约在4%的增长。 同时6月份中国进口额也下降0.7%，显示中国内需疲软。 海关总署综合统计司司长郑跃声称，中国外贸面临严峻挑战，同时预言中国下半年外贸仍将面临更多困难。 他强调中国需要调整对外贸易的方式以及结构，以保护中国产品在全球市场的份额。 假出口 有分析人士指出，中国6月进出口突降可能与中国最新的打击虚假出口的努力有关。 中国今年一季度外贸出现巨额顺差，但与其他国家提供的贸易数据存在严重出入。 金融界人士指出，这是因为中国外贸商人虚报出口定价，通过套利贸易方式躲避中国对资本的严格控制以将热钱注入中国市场。 中国外汇管理局5月起要求外贸企业解释清楚货物进出口和贸易收支总量不匹配的原因。如果不能给出满意的解释，这些企业将被打入外汇管理局的黑名单，接受更加严格的监管直至它们符合条例为止。 《金融时报》称中国第一季度的出口比上年增长了18%，但是去除了资金回流因素后，实际的出口增长应该只有13%。 郑跃声称，中国采取的打击套利贸易的措施已经在取得成效。 （撰稿/责编：伊人）
"Syria's head of antiquities was quoted as saying the temple was blown up on Sunday. The UK -based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that it happened a month ago. IS took control of Palmyra in May, sparking fears for the site. It is considered one of the ancient world's most important cultural centres. The ancient city, which is a Unesco World Heritage site, is famed for its well-preserved Graeco-Roman ruins, and the Baalshamin temple, built nearly 2,000 years ago, is one of the city's best-known buildings. The Islamic State group has destroyed several ancient sites in Iraq. The militants believe any shrines or statues implying the existence of another deity are sacrilege and idolatry, and should be destroyed. IS ""placed a large quantity of explosives in the temple of Baalshamin today [Sunday] and then blew it up causing much damage to the temple,"" Syrian antiquities chief Maamoun Abdul Karim told AFP news agency. ""The cella (inner area of the temple) was destroyed and the columns around collapsed,"" he said. Emma Loosley, a professor at Exeter University who lived near the ancient city for three years, said the temple's cella was ""pretty much perfect"". ""I can't think of another temple as beautifully preserved as the temple of Baalshamin, and what was special about Palmyra was that it was a unique culture,"" she told the BBC. ""It had its own gods, its own form of art and architecture that you don't get anywhere else."" Ancient city of Palmyra IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' Syrian ruins that influenced the West Palmyra 'was archaeologist's passion' Your memories of Palmyra The Baalshamin temple is dedicated to the Phoenician god of storms and fertilising rains, and was almost completely intact. The oldest parts of the temple are thought to have dated from the year 17AD. Residents who had fled from Palmyra also said IS had planted explosives at the temple, although they had done it about one month ago, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Last month, IS published photos of militants destroying what it said were artefacts looted at Palmyra. A week ago, it emerged that the archaeologist who had looked after Palmyra's ruins for four decades, Khaled al-Asaad, had been beheaded by the militant group. Mr Abdul Karim said the 81-year-old had refused to tell IS where some treasures had been hidden, in an effort to save them. The group has also published photos of what they said was the destruction of two Islamic shrines near Palmyra, which they described as ""manifestations of polytheism"". The modern city of Palmyra - known locally as Tadmur - is situated in a strategically important area on the road between the Syrian capital, Damascus, and the eastern city of Deir al-Zour. IS attacks on historical sites and artefacts January: IS ransacks the central library in the Iraqi city of Mosul, burning thousands of books. February: A video emerges showing the destruction of ancient artefacts at the central museum in Mosul. March: IS uses explosives and bulldozers on Nimrud, one of Iraq's greatest archaeological treasures. Shortly after, IS militants destroy ruins at Hatra.

"Officials say Yanjun Xu tried to steal trade secrets from US aviation and aerospace companies on behalf of China. He was arrested in Belgium earlier this year and on Tuesday extradited to the US. On Thursday, Beijing dismissed the espionage accusations against the official, saying there was no basis to the charges. China said it hoped the US would safeguard the legal rights of the Chinese individual, a foreign ministry spokesman said at a regular news briefing. A senior US justice department official said the case was ""part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense"". ""We cannot tolerate a nation's stealing our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower,"" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers added. Prosecutors say Mr Xu is a senior officer with China's ministry of state security - which is responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence and political security. He was detained in Belgium on 1 April at the request of the US. He was later indicted by an Ohio grand jury on four charges of conspiring to commit economic espionage and attempting to steal trade secrets. The indictment was unsealed on Wednesday following the suspect's extradition. Prosecutors allege that from 2013 Mr Xu targeted leading aviation companies as well as industry experts to obtain ""highly sensitive"" technical information. They say he invited employees to travel to China for an ""exchange of ideas"" or under the guise of delivering university presentations. Ohio-based aircraft engine giant GE Aviation was identified as one of the targets of the alleged operation. Conspiracy and attempt to commit economic espionage carries a maximum US prison sentence of 15 years, and conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets can carry a 10-year term. The charges come at a time of raised tension between the US and China. The two countries have become embroiled in an escalating trade war and President Trump has accused Beijing of trying to meddle in the upcoming mid-term elections. In a speech last week, US Vice-President Mike Pence accused Beijing of directing ""its bureaucrats and businesses to obtain American intellectual property - the foundation of our economic leadership - by any means necessary"".",美国司法部宣布，以经济间谍罪起诉涉嫌窃取美国航空和航天公司商业机密的中国情报官员徐延军（Xu Yanjun，音译）。,美国司法部的起诉书指，通用电气航空是相关间谍行动的其中一个目标。 检控方指，徐延军是中国国家安全部下属的江苏省安全厅副处长，该部门的职能是反情报、境外情报以及政治安全问题，而徐是在为中国窃取美国航空业的机密。 徐延军在今年较早前于比利时被捕，本周二（10月9日）被引渡至美国。 这是第一次有中国情报官员被引渡至美国公开受审。 美国司法部负责国家安全的助理部长约翰·德默斯（John Demers）指，案件是“以美国为代价发展中国的总体经济政策的一部分”。 这名司法部高级官员表示：“我们不能容忍一个国家偷走我们的火力和我们的脑力成果。” 在美国的要求下，徐延军于4月1日在比利时被拘留。之后，他被美国俄亥俄州大陪审团以四项罪名起诉，包括谋划实施经济间谍行为和意图窃取商业机密。 在嫌疑人被引渡之后的周三，16页的起诉书被正式公开。 起诉书指出，中国的知识产权政策当中包括了对外国技术的“再创新”，而包括航天产业技术在内的中国科技发展是由中国政府主导的。 通用电气航空每年生产数以千计的商用及军用飞机引擎。 掩盖身份 检控官指，徐延军还曾用过“曲辉”（Qu Hui，音译）、“张辉”（Zhang Hui，音译）等名字来执行任务，并试图以“江苏省科学技术协会（JAST）”的机构关系来掩盖他的真正职务。 起诉书称，从2013年起，徐延军就以美国顶尖航空公司以及行业专家为目标，获取“高度敏感”的技术信息，还会以“交流想法”或者在大学做演讲为名，邀请美国公司雇员前往中国。 总部设在俄亥俄州的飞机引擎巨头公司通用电气航空（GE Aviation）被指是有关窃密行动的目标之一。 在美国，谋划以及意图实施经济间谍行为的最高刑罚是15年监禁，谋划窃取商业机密则是10年监禁。 这一宗起诉正值中美两国关系变得紧张之际——两国贸易战正在升级，而美国总统特朗普则指控中国试图干预即将到来的美国中期选举。
"By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent A study says the haze lasted much longer because the melting ice and increased snowfall altered wind circulation patterns. If Arctic ice continues to shrink due to climate change, the scientists say similar events will likely recur. They argue that this could threaten the Beijing Winter Olympics set for 2022. Emissions puzzle Air quality issues have plagued China in recent years but the pollution experienced in January 2013 was significant because it lasted so long. The large-scale haze stayed in place for almost a month and around 70% of China's 74 major cities exceeded the daily air quality standard for very fine particulate matter, which poses serious risks to health. Scientists were puzzled by the event as the Chinese government had taken steps to curb emissions from coal fired power plants, one of the most significant contributors to air pollution. Now researchers say that record Arctic sea ice decline in late 2012, plus extensive snowfall over Siberia disturbed wind patterns and produced stagnant air conditions over the east China plain. ""In wintertime, in regions like Beijing you get these north west howling winds that blow like hell,"" said Prof Yuhang Wang from Georgia Tech University, one of the report's authors. ""A ridge system controls the intensity and location of this cold air moving south so what happens when you put in sea ice forcing or snow forcing, the ridge system gets weaker and moves eastward - instead of cold air blowing in the eastern part of China, it went to Korea and Japan in January 2013."" The research team looked at ventilation conditions over the past 35 years and were able to show that the poor dispersal seen in 2013 was unique. They then looked at the climate related factors that might contribute to poor ventilation and their findings indicate that the loss of Arctic ice and snowfall over the forests of Eurasia were critical for the haze event. The researchers weren't able to separate the scale of the impacts between these two factors. What they are sure about is that in combination, they made the haze much worse. ""You see evidence in the summer that the particulate matter is getting less, but you don't see a clear trend in the winter and what we believe is that the effort is being hammered by changes in the Polar region with ice and snow,"" said Prof Wang. The researchers say that global climate change will likely ensure that Arctic sea ice continues to decline and maintain the conditions for haze events. They say this could threaten the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022 which will take place across a large geographical area. In their view it poses a greater threat to these future games, than dirty air did to the summer games in 2008. ""Had the Chinese government not reduced emissions as much as they did in the last four years we would have seen the same or worse airpocalypse events,"" said Prof Wang. ""We haven't seen it as much because of these emissions reductions and the study shows that if you want to clean up air during the Olympics they have to cut emissions even more drastically than they expected before."" The authors say that while China can take more steps to curb particulate matter, curbing the greenhouse gases that are helping to shrink Arctic sea ice, will take a global effort. The study has been published in the journal, Science Advances.

"They say the hold-up took place on Sunday morning at a jewellery exhibition at the Carlton Hotel. The hotel is located on the Croisette promenade - one of the most prestigious locations in the town. The theft is the largest in a series of high-profile robberies in Cannes, which is famous for its annual film festival. The Carlton Hotel is where Alfred Hitchcock filmed To Catch A Thief - his 1955 film about a jewel thief operating in the French Riviera. 'Rich pickings' During the latest theft, an exhibition of diamonds by the jeweller Leviev was being held in the lobby of the hotel. Local media said the robber made off with the jewels in a briefcase. It is not yet known who the owner was. If the value of the jewels is confirmed, it would reportedly be the second-largest heist in France. A Cannes police spokesman said: ""A full and urgent operation is under way to catch the culprit and recover these jewels. Thieves see Cannes as rich pickings."" The Cannes film festival, which attracts celebrities from around the world, was hit by two jewellery thefts in May this year. A necklace by Swiss jeweller De Grisogono reportedly worth 1.9m euros ($2.5m; £1.6m) vanished after a celebrity party at a five-star hotel in the resort town of Cap d'Antibes. A week before, more than 777,000 euros ($1m; £650,000) worth of jewels were taken from the hotel room of an employee of exclusive Swiss jewellers Chopard. The Carlton Hotel itself saw also a huge robbery in August 1994, when gunmen burst into its jewellery store just as it was closing and made off with jewels then valued at £30m (now $77m; £50m; 58m euros). France's biggest ever robbery took place in 2008, when three men stole almost every piece on display at a jewellery exhibition in Paris with an estimated value of 85m euros ($113m; £73m).",法国“蔚蓝海岸”度假胜地戛纳，一名男子持械偷走价值大约四千万欧元（5300万美元）的珠宝。,被盗珠宝正在酒店大厅内展出 官员说，事件于星期日（28日）早晨发生在卡尔顿酒店（Carlton）内举办的一起珠宝展览上。 这家大酒店位于戛纳最有名的海滨大道。 戛纳以每一年度的国际电影节著称。这里曾经发生过一系列引人注目的盗窃案。 希区柯克1955年拍摄的著名影片《捉贼记》讲述的是在“蔚蓝海岸”活动的珠宝盗贼，影片恰好也是在卡尔顿酒店拍摄的。 “全面、紧急” 最新一起偷盗活动，盗贼选定的目标是珠宝商利维夫（Leviev）在酒店大厅内举办的钻石展。 模特佩戴在戛纳电影节上失窃的项链 当地媒体报道说，盗贼把珠宝装进公文箱后逃走。现在还不知道被盗珠宝的主人是谁。 如果珠宝的价值最后得以确认的话，这将成为法国发生的总价值位居第二的抢劫案。 戛纳警方发言人说，警方发动“全面、紧急行动”力争抓获盗贼、追回珠宝。 今年五月间举行的戛纳电影节吸引了来自世界各地的明星名流，其间也发生了两起珠宝盗窃案。 在一家五星级酒店举办的名流晚会上，一条价值190万欧元（约合250万美元）的项链被盗。 此前一个星期，盗贼从瑞士珠宝商萧邦（Chopard）雇员酒店房间的保险箱内偷走价值77.7万欧元（1百万美元）的珠宝。 1994年8月，卡尔顿酒店本身也曾发生一起著名抢劫案。持枪人闯入即将关门的珠宝店，抢走当时估价3000万英镑的珠宝（现价5000万英镑，5800万欧元，7700万美元）。 法国历史上价值最高的一起偷盗案发生在2008年。当时，三名盗贼将在巴黎举行的一次珠宝展几乎洗劫一空。被盗珠宝总价值估计在8500万欧元（1130万美元）。 （编译：苏平 / 责编：晧宇）
"The image, which shows a young boy hunched over a sewing machine making Union Jack bunting, disappeared from the side of a Poundland shop last week. It is now for sale in Miami, with an estimate of £320,000 - £452,000. Councillor Alan Strickland said there is ""lots of anger"" at the removal, and is campaigning for the work's return. ""Residents have been really shocked and really astonished,"" he told the BBC. ""Banksy gave that piece of art to our community, and people came from all over London to see it. He said residents are ""disappointed"" that a ""piece of art that was given freely has been taken away from them and sold for an enormous profit"". 'Above board' Fine Art Auctions in Miami described the work as ""stencil and spray paint on render with additional jubilee bunting"". It rejected suggestions that the mural was stolen, saying the listing came from a ""well-known collector"", who had signed a contract to say ""everything was above board"". The work appeared in Whymark Avenue, Wood Green, north London, in May last year. It is thought to be a commentary on the use of sweat-shop labour. Professor Paul Gough, an academic who studies street art, said it was likely to be a genuine Banksy, who works under a veil of anonymity, and rarely takes credit for his art. Poundland welcomed the arrival of the piece, saying they were ""fans of Banksy"", but rejecting any suggestion they were the target of his satire. Tim McDonnell, the store's retail director, said: ""Poundland has a clear defined code of conduct for all our suppliers and a strong ethical stance on all labour issues."" Councillor Strickland said residents noticed scaffolding go up around the store last Wednesday. ""The scaffolding and tarpaulins came down on Friday, and on Saturday residents noticed that, where the Banksy had been, there was now a hole in the wall."" Number of thefts The chain said it was not responsible for ""either selling or removing the Banksy mural,"" saying it did not own the building. The owners of the property have been traced, and Haringey council is trying to contact them to establish whether the work was taken legitimately. Residents are also organising an email campaign, asking the auction company to abandon the sale. Banksy's work has been at the centre of a number of thefts over the years. In May 2010, two pieces were stolen from a gallery in London, after a man used a road sign to smash a glass window at the front of the building. A year later, a piece known as Sperm Alarm was ripped off the wall of a hotel in Central London, and appeared on eBay for £17,000. It was never recovered.",去年女王登基60周年大庆之前出现在伦敦街头的班克斯（Banksy）壁画神秘消失，现在却在美国的一个拍卖网站上露面。,这幅壁画出现在北伦敦伍德格林的一条街道上。据信，它想传达的信息与使用廉价劳动力有关。 这幅涂鸦壁画显示一个男孩在用缝纫机缝制一串英国国旗，但在上周从它原先所在的地点--一家连锁廉价商店一镑店（Poundland shop）的外墙上消失。 现在，这幅壁画在美国迈阿密被人拿去拍卖，估计成交价在32万到45万两千英镑之间。 班克斯的这幅壁画被人挖走曾引起公众愤怒，有人正在为这幅作品的重归展开宣传攻势。 这幅壁画出现在北伦敦伍德格林（Wood Green）的一条街道上。据信，它想传达的信息与使用廉价劳动力有关。 夏灵基地方政府（Haringey council）的立法委员斯特里克兰（Alan Strickland）说，当地居民真的感到惊愕。班克斯将这幅作品送给我们的社区，人们从伦敦各地前来观赏它。 他说，居民们对这样一个免费赠送的艺术作品被拿去拍卖，牟取暴利感到非常失望。 迈阿密的艺术珍品拍卖行形容班克斯的这幅涂鸦作品是一个带有钻禧气息的喷漆模板作品。 但它驳斥了这幅壁画作品被人偷盗，说他们是从一个著名艺术收藏家那里得到这幅作品的。这名收藏家在拍卖协议上称这幅作品的来路光明正大。 一镑店方面对班克斯的作品出现在他们店铺的外墙上表示欢迎，并称他们喜欢班克斯的作品。 据当地居民称，这家一镑店的四周在上星期三搭起了脚手架，周六班克斯的壁画神秘消失。 但店方否认自己参与挪走和拍卖班克斯壁画作品，并说那座建筑不属于他们，是他们租借的。 现在，夏灵基地方政府正在寻找该建筑的主人，以便确认班克斯的壁画被挪走是否合法。 与内文相关的链接 相关话题
"Christian Taxil, who represents the CFE-CGC union on the board, said conditions were ""not right"" for the £18bn project. The same union has previously suggested that investment in Hinkley Point C should be delayed until 2019. It said there were problems with a similar reactor design in France. Last week, French economy minister Emmanuel Macron said EDF would now make a final investment decision on the Hinkley Point nuclear reactor in early May. Mr Taxil expressed his opposition in a letter to EDF employees. He said EDF's weak financial position, technical issues and the current state of the energy market were all factors that had influenced him. Delay urged Meanwhile, it has also emerged that some EDF engineers have expressed renewed doubts about the reactor technology. In an internal company document, leaked to the Financial Times, they argued that a redesign was needed in order to make the plant less complex and less expensive. Instead of pledging that the plant would be operational in 2025, they said, the company should adopt a more ""realistic"" date of 2027. In response to the FT article, EDF issued a statement denouncing ""unfounded rumours and fanciful stories"". The firm added: ""EDF refutes these rumours and confirms that the date of first operation of the first reactor is fixed at the end of 2025 and that no delay is anticipated. ""EDF regards this anonymous press campaign as seriously harmful to our interests, as well as the interests of the industry and to jobs in France and Europe."" Funding fears EDF, which is 85% French state-owned, has yet to outline how it will fund the project. In October last year, EDF agreed a deal under which China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) would pay a third of the cost of the project in exchange for a 33.5% stake. But EDF has been struggling to find the cash for its remaining 66.5% stake. Earlier this month, the company's chief executive, Jean-Bernard Levy, said that the financial context was ""challenging"" and that he was negotiating with the French government to secure more funding. The UK government has been criticised for guaranteeing a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour of electricity - more than twice the current cost - for the electricity Hinkley produces for 35 years. The UK government has said it is ""committed"" to Hinkley.",法国电力公司（EDF）的一位董事会成员说，他将对英国欣克利角核电站计划投反对票。,由中资参与在英国欣克利角建造核电站的计划一直存在着争议 代表法国CFE-CGC工会组织的董事会成员塔克西勒（Christian Taxil）说，实施这项耗资180亿英镑计划的条件并不成熟。 CFE-CGC工会是代表职业雇员和高级管理人员的工会组织，这个组织此前曾提出把英国欣克利角核电站项目推迟到2019年。 CFE-CGC工会表示，在法国的一个同类型设计的核电站存在一些问题。 法国经济部长马科龙（Emmanuel Macron）在上个星期说，EDF将在5月上旬就欣克利角核电站作出最后的投资决定。 塔克西勒在写给EDF雇员的一封信中说，EDF薄弱的财政状况、技术问题以及目前能源市场的状况都是他提出反对意见的影响因素。 与此同时，EDF的一些工程师再次表达了对核电站技术问题的担忧。 英国《金融时报》得到的一份公司内部文件显示，一些工程师认为应当重新设计电站，目前的设计过于复杂和昂贵。 这些工程师认为，不应该把电站开始运作的时间定在2025年，而2027年开始运作更为现实。 EDF回应《金融时报》的报道说，这都是没有根据的谣言和充满幻想的故事。 EDF发表声明说，EDF否认这些谣言，并且确认核电站第一座反应堆开始运作的时间是2025年，目前没有延期的预测。 EDF是法国国有电力公司，国家拥有85%的股份。 去年10月，EDF同中国广核集团（CGN）达成协议，由广核集团出资三分之一兴建欣克利角核电站，条件是允许广核集团占有电站33.5%的份额。 但是，EDF一直在为筹集另外66.5%份额的资金而努力。 英国政府表示，他们将保持对欣克利角核电站项目所做的承诺。 （编译：跃生 责编：路西）
"By Stephen McDonellBBC News, Beijing It brought waves of hype in China that the country was preparing to celebrate not only a festival of sport but the return of the ""Middle Kingdom"" to the centre of the universe. At least that is how it felt at the time. In the years leading up to the Olympics it was as if there was nothing this place could not achieve. The economy was charging ahead, newspapers were starting to dig up investigative stories, millions of poor people were able to buy electrical goods for the first time and bars and restaurants were heaving with 24-hour hedonistic temptation. ""There was a party every night. That's how I felt,"" laughs 45-year-old architect Dong Hao. ""The whole city; the whole country was not only about fun but that a lot of things were now possible. Everything was more tolerant and more liberal."" Dong Hao is a native of Beijing and studied in New York. Before, say, 2005 you might have expected somebody like him to make his career overseas but the pre-Olympic potential drew him home. After all he is an architect and there was a building boom. The Olympics were coming and enormous structures with breath-taking designs were being erected at breakneck speed. Beijing Capital Airport, Beijing South Train Station, the National Centre for the Performing Arts, the Water Cube and, of course, the Bird's Nest Olympic stadium… up up up! ""Everyone wanted something exciting and maybe it was unreasonable,"" says Dong Hao. ""Maybe not functional, maybe not necessary: it doesn't matter, let's have it!"" Some of the unique possibilities of the pre-Olympic frenzy may have dried up but that the process is now more considered, he says. ""Now the market and the clients are more mature."" Dong Hao adds that it is pretty hard to impress anyone in China with your design now that people have seen the China Central Television (CCTV) building. When two huge towers were growing, jutting up and out to eventually link and become the seemingly impossible to balance CCTV headquarters, I remember them initially being joined by an enormous net. Along that net you could see Chinese workers up in the air crawling from one side to the other. It looked terrifying. There aren't exact figures on industrial accidents accompanying the speed with which the city's architectural wonders appeared, but they certainly provided a lot of jobs for once poor farmers. From building to renovating There were so many labourers in Beijing at the time sleeping in on-site dormitories that nobody knew how many millions really lived here. Last year, the city government launched a deliberate campaign to reduce what one official called the ""low-end population"". Entire suburbs housing the poor have been levelled and many of the small enterprises where they worked are gone. But some working class folk from outside Beijing are still holding on. In the run up to the Games, Sun Jingsu came from Hennan Province to find a better life. He is still here, next to the Bird's Nest using a trowel to spread cement across a new fence. ""There's not as much construction work as there used to be,"" he says. ""Now we're doing renovations and the like."" ""I don't really know,"" he says when I ask him about his future plans. ""But I guess it must be back in the countryside."" Apart from finding work, a major problem for manual labourers now is affordability. Sun Jingsu proudly tells me he earns more than 200 yuan ($29; £22) a day. It's above the average for this type of work, but it's what some people in Beijing spend on lunch. A short walk down the street, waitress Wei Xufang is selling fruit to customers. She came to Beijing from Shanxi, where she'd watched the Olympics as a 15 year old. She thinks Chinese people are as positive about the future now as they were 10 years ago. You only have to look at the city's streetscape to appreciate the Olympic legacy, she says. ""Beijing is such a clean city. There are always people cleaning it."" More than just sport Ordinary Chinese people, known affectionately as ""lao bai xing"", were supposed to get more healthy and active as a result of the Games. Mass fitness displays were featured on television and more participation in sport encouraged. But some say this hasn't really had its intended results. ""You couldn't really say that the Olympics had a huge impact on say children playing sport"", says junior soccer coach Yao Liwei. ""The football world cup has had a much bigger impact."" The ex-footballer also thinks that China has not improved its overall sporting performance since the Games. And yet Beijing's Olympics was about much more than just sport. The city had tried and failed to secure the Games in the years following the bloody 1989 Tiananmen Square clashes so it had to make certain promises in order to secure this most coveted prize. Officials said they would allow designated protest sites during the Olympics. In practice though, the Communist Party reneged on this. There were so-called ""protest locations"" but you needed to somehow apply for and get approval to use them. This was never going to be allowed in any meaningful way. Rules governing the foreign press were also changed, allowing correspondents to travel around without the permission of provincial Party officials. China's media remained state controlled but started to do more real reporting, like when a television crew went undercover to expose a brick kiln using children, many kidnapped, as cheap labour. However, former journalist Yuen Chan says this was still well short of some sort of golden age. ""Despite all the hype about relaxed regulations for the media in the run-up to the Olympics in 2008 the authorities' grip on the domestic media was still tight,"" she says. The Hong Kong based ex-reporter says the reason it seems worse now is that the Chinese state has simply become better at censorship. In 2008 ""it was less sophisticated and more was able to slip through the cracks,"" she says. ""The space is far more strictly and efficiently controlled now, as we can see through the deployment of technology to boost surveillance systems at all levels"". 'People watching you' The once exploding art scene here has also taken a hit from the censors since the more freewheeling period ten years ago. ""Like many in China at that time I was hoping that the Chinese people might be getting a better chance to know the world and that there might be more freedom of expression,"" says artist Guo Jian. He returned to China after living in Australia for years, full of pre-Olympic hope for his homeland. ""I thought we would be gradually moving towards a rule of law society and that we would see political reforms again; that China would embrace the world."" But while his career flourished, he also saw freedom disappearing. ""There was less internet freedom, there were people watching you,"" he says. ""I was told not to do any shows which were too provocative and to not speak to the media and especially the western media."" The Australian passport holder tried to make a go of it, balancing artistic expression with the need to minimise the extent to which the authorities might become upset with his work. But when he planned to cover a diorama of Tiananmen Square with rotting meat - a clear reference to the crackdown - this became too much for the officials. In 2014, Guo Jian was kicked out the country. ""I was hoping that China would be moving to a better place,"" he says. ""At a government level, I am not very optimistic about the present nor about the future. ""However Chinese people are waking up. People now realise that all the dreams they gave us are just bull."" 'Beijing is much prettier' Human rights groups point to the mass detention of lawyers, the establishment of vast new ""re-education"" camps in the western region of Xinjiang as part of a crackdown on the country's ethnic Uighur Muslims, the explosion in facial recognition surveillance available to the authorities and on and on the list goes. Yet for the majority of Chinese people none of this really touches them. Inside the Birds Nest, 80-year old Cong Ruiying is beaming. She has come to the capital from Jiangsu province with her family. These days the stadium has a nightly light show reliving the music and feeling of the Games. A visit to the Olympic zone is a must for the thousands of Chinese tourists travelling to Beijing every day. Cong Ruiyang didn't get a chance to be here in 2008 and she's excited to have finally arrived. ""It's beautiful,"" she says as the multi-coloured lasers zoom around. I ask what she thinks of the city overall. ""It's become prettier and actually much better."" Does she prefer the China of today or 2008? She smiles, has a bit of a laugh and looks at me like I am some kind of nutcase to even ask such a question. ""Of course it's better now,"" she says.",10年前的这一周，北京奥运会通过电视屏幕传播到全球。,"奥运会主场馆鸟巢是北京最著名的建筑之一。 在中国国内对这场奥运会铺天盖地的宣传中，中国人准备迎接的不仅仅是一场体育盛会，更是“中央王国”瞄准宇宙中心的回归。 至少在当时感觉如此。 在筹备奥运的几年间，这个国家有一种气势，好像没有什么是这里无法实现的。中国经济蓬勃发力，媒体开始挖掘调查报导，成千上万的穷人终于有能力购买电子产品，酒吧和餐厅里24小时弥漫着享乐主义的诱惑。 “每天晚上都有派对，我感觉是这样的，”45岁的建筑师董灏笑着说。 “整个城市，全国上下，不仅变得好玩了，很多事情也变得有可能了。一切都变得更包容、更自由。” 董灏是北京人，曾在纽约读书。2005年以前，你可能觉得像他这样的人会在海外工作，但受奥运会前的潜力吸引，他选择回国。 董灏称，2008年的北京比之前任何时候都“更自由”。 毕竟他是一个建筑师，而北京则有一阵建筑热潮。伴随奥运会一步步临近，各种大型建筑正以惊人的速度、让人赞叹的建筑物一座座拔地而起。 北京首都机场、北京南站、国家大剧院、水立方、当然还有奥运会主场馆鸟巢……起起起！ “所有人都想要刺激的东西，有时候甚至可能是没有道理的刺激，”董灏说。 “有可能不实用，有可能不必要，但这都没关系，我们要有！” 央视大楼有两座角度奇特的塔状建筑连接而成。 董灏表示，一部分由奥运前的狂热带来的独特机遇可能已经湮灭，但现在人们会对过程给予更多关注。 “现在的市场和客户更加成熟。” 董灏补充道，自从见过中央电视台（CCTV）的建筑后，中国人已经很难对其他设计赞叹不已了。 当时在央视大楼施工现场，两座巨型塔不断变高，在高空中以看似不可能的方式对接，我还记得它们最初是由一张巨大的网拼接在一起的。沿着那张网，你可以看到有中国工人在高空中从一端爬到另一端。 这场景看上去很可怕。 在北京建筑奇迹加速的同时，关于施工事故没有确切统计数据，不过这些建筑肯定为曾经贫穷的农民们提供了大量工作机会。 盖房子和拆房子 在当时的北京，有许许多多工人住在工地的宿舍，由于这个群体太过庞大，没人知道到底有多少人曾经住在这种地方。 去年北京市政府开展了一次针对""低端人口""的拆除运动。穷人居住的郊区被夷为平地，他们工作的许多小企业也都消失了。 在北京清理低端人口的大行动中，一夜之间，相关街道几乎被夷为平地。 但也有一些住在北京市区外的劳动者仍在坚守。 为了过上更好的生活，孙景苏在奥运会前从河南来到北京。他现在仍在北京，在鸟巢旁边铺水泥。 “现在活儿没有以前多了，”他说。“以前盖楼房的活儿多，现在都是小活儿，基本上楼房已经饱和了。” “我不知道，”当我问他个人的未来打算时，他这么回答。 “未来肯定是向农村发展。” 孙景苏每天收入超过200元人民币。 除了找工作，体力劳动者目前面临的一个主要问题还有经济承担能力。 孙景苏自豪地告诉我，他每天收入超过200元人民币。这比同类工作的平均工资要高，但同时，在北京有的人一顿午餐就能花掉这些钱。 沿着同一条路多走几步，可以看到魏旭方正在卖水果。 她来自山西，15岁那年她在家收看了奥运会。魏旭方认为，现在的中国人对未来跟10年前一样乐观。 她说，你只需要看看这座城市的街景，就可以欣赏到奥运遗产。“北京是环境很好、特别干净的一座城市，总是有人打扫。” 不仅仅是体育 人们原本期待，奥运会可以让中国老百姓更加健康、更有活力。电视上播放着大量健身节目，大众被鼓励积极参加更多体育活动。 但有人说，这并没有带来预期的结果。 “不能说奥运会给孩子们参与体育有巨大影响，”青少年足球教练姚立伟说，“世界杯的影响更大。” 这位前足球运动员还认为，奥运会之后，中国整体的体育表现并未得到改善。 然而，北京奥运会不仅仅事关体育。 北京奥运会期间，示威在理论上是允许的，但实践中并没有实际意义。 1989年天安门广场流血冲突后，北京曾经尝试申办奥运会，但没有成功。为了确保得到这个机会，北京必须做出一些保证。 有官员表示，他们将在奥运期间允许划出特定的示威地点。但在实践中，中国共产党没有遵守这个承诺。 尽管有所谓的“示威专区”，但需要提前申请，得到许可后方能使用。这种规定使得这些专区永远不可能起到实际性作用。 奥运会期间，针对外国媒体的规定也有变化，记者们可以自由前往其他地区，不需经过地方党员干部允许。 中国媒体仍受国家管控，但开始可以做更多真正的报导。比如，有一家电视台记者卧底采访，揭露了一个廉价使用童工的砖窑，其中许多人是被绑架的。 然而前记者陈婉雯表示，这远远不能被称作黄金时代。 “尽管当局在2008年奥运会前夕放宽了对媒体的规定，但对国内媒体的控制仍然很严，”她说。 这位前香港记者表示，现在情况之所以看上去更加糟糕，是因为中国政府在审查方面更得心应手了。 陈婉雯说，在2008年，当局的手段“没有那么复杂，有一些漏洞可以钻”，“现在的控制更加严格，效率更高，我们可以看到在各个层面都有技术推动监控系统发展。” “有人在监视你” 相比起十年前更自由的那段时期，曾经活跃的艺术圈也受到了审查的打击。 “就像当时许多中国人一样，我希望中国人可以有更好的机会了解世界，有更多的言论自由，”艺术家郭健说。 在澳大利亚生活多年后，满怀对奥运前对祖国的憧憬，他回到中国。 “我认为我们将逐步走向法治社会，我们将再次看到政治改革，中国将拥抱世界。” 但在事业蓬勃发展的同时，郭健也看到了自由的消失。 “网络自由度比较低，有人在监视你，”他说。 “我被告知不要做任何过于挑衅的展览，不要跟媒体，尤其是西方媒体说话。” 郭健在2014年被中国当局驱逐出境。 郭健持有澳大利亚护照，他一度想要放弃这个身份，以降低当局不满，平衡自己的艺术表达。 但当他计划用腐烂的肉覆盖天安门广场的立体模型，很明显是在映射1989年的镇压行动时，中国官员觉得他已经过线了。 2014年，郭健被驱逐出境。 “我希望中国能有更好的未来，”他说。“从政府层面来讲，我对现在和未来都不太乐观。” “然而中国人正在觉醒。人们意识到了，他们给我们灌输的所有梦想都是废话。” “北京变美了” 有人权组织表示：中国有许多律师被关押；在新疆西部，有大量新建的“劳改”营地，这是中国打压维吾尔族穆斯林行动的一部分；官方的人脸识别监控技术呈爆炸式发展……这个清单还有很多很多。 然而对绝大多数中国人来说，这些对他们没有任何触动。 鸟巢内，80岁的聪瑞英满脸笑容。她和家人一起，从江苏来到了首都。 这些天，一场夜间灯光秀在鸟巢上演，让人重温奥运时的音乐，让奥运时的感觉重现。对于每天涌入北京的成千上万中国游客来说，奥运场馆区是必游景点。 鸟巢灯光秀。 2008年时，聪瑞英没有机会来到这里，现在终于来了，她十分兴奋。 “很好看，”各色灯光汇聚之下，她说。 我问道，她是怎么看北京的。 “变美了，好多了。” 她更喜欢今天的中国还是2008年的中国？她微笑着，有点笑出声，看着我，好像我问出这种问题有点无厘头。 “比以前好是肯定了，”她说。 BBC中国博客为您带来BBC驻华记者与中国事务记者的观察。 点击这里阅读英文原文。"
"The 37-year-old mother of six has explained her reasons for having the surgery in the New York Times. She said her doctors estimated she had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer. ""I decided to be proactive and to minimise the risk as much I could,"" she wrote. Her partner, Brad Pitt, praised her choice as ""absolutely heroic"". Risk reduced Ms Jolie said the process began in February and was completed by the end of April. In an article entitled My Medical Choice, she explained that her mother fought cancer for nearly a decade and died at the age of 56. She said she had sought to reassure her children that the same illness would not take her away from them, ""but the truth is I carry a 'faulty' gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer"". She said that once she ""knew that this was my reality"", she had taken the decision to undergo the nine weeks of complex surgery required to have a double mastectomy, followed by reconstruction of the breasts with implants. ""There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful,"" she wrote. Her chances of developing breast cancer have now dropped from 87% to under 5%, she said. She praised her partner, actor Brad Pitt, for his love and support throughout the procedure, and said she was reassured that her children had found nothing in the results ""that makes them uncomfortable"". ""I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity,"" she said. ""For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options,"" Ms Jolie went on to say. ""I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices."" In an interview with the Evening Standard, Brad Pitt said: ""Having witnessed this decision firsthand, I find Angie's choice, as well as so many others like her, absolutely heroic. ""All I want for is for her to have a long and healthy life, with myself and our children. This is a happy day for our family."" Ms Jolie, an award-winning actress and director, is also a long-time supporter of humanitarian causes. She is currently a special envoy for the UN Refugee Agency. During the period she was undergoing the double mastectomy procedure, Ms Jolie visited the Democratic Republic of Congo with UK Foreign Secretary William Hague and attended the G8 summit of foreign ministers in London to raise awareness over sexual violence in conflict. She also helped launch a charity to fund girls' education set up by the Pakistani schoolgirl activist Malala Yousafzai, who survived being shot by the Taliban last October. Ms Jolie has three biological children and three adopted children. Risk factor Emma Parlons, a 38-year-old mother from London who had the operation three years ago, welcomed her decision to raise awareness of the issue. Ms Parlons said her risk of getting breast cancer was the same as the actress's. ""If somebody said your flight across the Atlantic was 86% likely to come down, you wouldn't get on that plane would you?"" she said in an explanation of her reasons for having the operation. Professor Gareth Evans, of the Manchester Breast Centre in Britain, said the two genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer one and two) ""were the first two majorly breast cancer pre-disposing genes that were identified"" and are also linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. ""The risk associated with the genes isn't simply an exact figure like 87%,"" he told the BBC. ""It does depend on other risk factors, and so the risk for someone with a BRCA1 mutation could vary anywhere between 50 and 95% for breast cancer."" Currently, women facing a strong likelihood of developing breast cancer have only two real options - to have both of their breasts removed (a double mastectomy) or hope that it will never actually happen. In January, the drugs watchdog in England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, recommended women at a high genetic risk of breast cancer should be given the option of taking the drug Tamoxifen, or another one called raloxifene, for five years to cut their lifetime risk of the disease.",为预防患乳腺癌，名震英美影坛的好莱坞影星安吉利娜·朱莉（Angelina Jolie)接受了双乳切除手术。,朱莉说，做出动手术的抉择让她感到有力量，她没有觉得她的女性特征受到了任何影响。 今年37岁的朱莉是六个孩子的妈妈。她在《纽约时报》撰文解释了她决定接受手术的原因。 朱莉说，医生的诊断认为，她患乳腺癌的危险几率是87%、患卵巢癌的几率是50%。 她说：“我决定采取预防措施，尽可能减少患癌的危险”。 “我的选择” 在题为《我的医疗选择》一文中，朱莉说，她的母亲与癌症病魔搏斗了近10年，在56岁的时候死于癌症。 朱莉说，她一直安慰她的孩子们，不会让癌症夺去他们的妈妈，但“事实是，我有危险基因BRCA1，它大大增加了我患乳腺癌和卵巢癌的几率”。 朱莉说，手术后，她患乳腺癌的机率从87%降到了5%。 朱莉称赞了她的丈夫，好来坞巨星布拉德·皮特（Brad Pitt）的关爱和支持。 朱莉说，做出动手术的抉择让她感到有力量，她没有觉得她的女性特征受到了任何影响。 她说，对那些读到她的文章的妇女，她希望能帮助她们认识到，她们可以有选择。 朱莉不但是好莱坞影星和导演，还长期致力于人道援助事业。她目前担任联合国的特使。 在接受乳房切除手术和治疗期间，她还与英国外交大臣黑格一起访问了刚果民主共和国，并出席了在伦敦举行的工业八国外长会议，提请关注战乱对妇女的性暴力行为。
"Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter Public services and safety will be carefully managed though data, while devices in our homes will talk to each other and the wider world as part of the ""internet-of-things"". Many of these services will be delivered over what is called 5G. It will be much more than just faster data on our phones, but potentially transformational for our lives - if you believe the hype. But there is a darker fear as well. What if it is also transformational for our security if we end up reliant on a Chinese company to deliver this future? That question risks causing a major divide in the Five Eyes - the intelligence alliance between the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The US is campaigning hard among allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from delivering 5G. ""We have serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere,"" Bill Evanina, head of America's National Counterintelligence and Security Center has said. ""Chinese company relationships with the Chinese government aren't like private sector company relationships with governments in the West."" 'Rigorous oversight' Huawei has always denied being controlled by the Chinese government, or that its work poses any risks of espionage and sabotage. Its founder repeated these assertions in a recent interview with the BBC. But Australia and New Zealand have sounded negative about Huawei's involvement in their 5G networks to varying degrees, and Canada is still deciding. All eyes are now on the UK. In a speech in Brussels on Wednesday, Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, set out the framework for considering the security of 5G based on its experience so far of working with the company. The current oversight regime was ""arguably the toughest and most rigorous"" in the world for Huawei, he said. His officials say they have found ''poor security and engineering"" by the company, but the indications are still that the UK may work with Huawei on 5G. If that is the decision then other countries - not only in the Five Eyes but also the EU and Nato - may well be tempted to follow, using the UK as a reference point because of its track record of scrutiny. There could be consequences, former officials warn. ""Worries about the security of UK networks following their exposure to Huawei may make the Five Eyes partners, and perhaps others such as France, Germany or Japan, less inclined to co-operate with the UK in the future,"" Charles Parton, a former British diplomat, argues in a new paper for the think tank Rusi. ""The maintenance of a 'Five Eyes standard' of cyber-security in telecommunications is a vital strategic and security interest, the loss of which would go far beyond a reduction in intelligence reports exchanged, and might lead to the UK being excluded from work on developing future technologies for intelligence collection."" 'Resilience is key' The UK's special relationship with Huawei came about in the early 2000s, when BT was upgrading its networks and the Chinese firm came in much cheaper than the alternatives - by hundreds of millions of pounds. BT told the government it planned to use the company unless the government was willing to compensate it. Even though Huawei was kept out of the core of the network and sensitive systems, concerns over security and the growing use of Huawei by other companies led - a few years later - to the creation of a ""cell"" to evaluate the security of Huawei products coming into the UK. The cell's last oversight report downgraded the assurance about mitigating the risks associated with Huawei, because of serious problems with security and engineering processes. However, Mr Martin said in his speech, the report said that these were not indicators of hostile activity by China, . The company says it will invest money to deal with these concerns in the coming years, although UK officials say that so far they have not seen ""a credible plan"". Despite that, the indications are that the UK wants to hold out against US pressure and continue to work with the company on 5G. A decision is expected in the next two months by ministers who will need to balance security with costs and the risks to wider relationships. ""Resilience is key,"" Mr Martin said in Brussels. ""There must be sustainable diversity in the supplier market."" That was one signal that even though the UK may work with Huawei, it is cautious about ending up with one dominant player on whom it is dependent. But critics fear that Huawei - possibly with Chinese state backing - is working its way into a dominant position in the long term, particularly by penetrating markets in the developing world and by setting standards for 5G. One of the biggest challenges with 5G is cost. Significant cost In many countries, telecoms companies paid much more for the 5G spectrum than they had expected. They are now looking at the sums and indicating their strong preference for the cheapest vendor - Huawei. Telecoms operators in the UK say the way in which 5G can work in a highly integrated system alongside 4G means that excluding Huawei is not realistic without significant cost and delay, including potentially removing existing hardware, leading to the UK falling behind. Breaking the ties with the company could also have significant consequences for the UK-China relationship which poses challenges with Brexit approaching. But the question will be how the US and the Trump administration reacts if the UK does not follow its line - especially if other countries use the UK as cover to follow and work with Huawei. This at a time when the UK may be looking for a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. It potentially leaves the UK between a rock and a hard place and is one more reason why the Huawei decision is placing strain on the historically close Five Eyes intelligence relationship.",在光明乐观的愿景中，未来我们将生活在“智能城市”：无人驾驶汽车在智能电网上充好电后，会核对最佳路线。,"公共服务和安全保障将通过数据得以细致管理，而我们家中的设备会作为物联网的一部分互相对话，与更广阔的世界交流。 许多这样的服务会通过5G传送。如果你相信宣传，这不仅意味着我们手机上的数据更快，还可能改变我们的生活。 但这也带来了担忧。如果我们未来最终依赖中国公司来传输这些数据，而这种依赖对我们的安全带来彻底改变，这将意味着什么？ 这个问题或许会给""五眼联盟""带来巨大分歧。“五眼联盟”是由美国、英国、加拿大、澳大利亚和新西兰组成的情报联盟。美国正在盟友间大力游说，希望将中国电信巨头华为排除在5G供应商之外。 “我们十分担忧华为对中国政府的义务，以及它对美国和其他地区电信网络完整性的威胁，”美国国家反情报与安全中心总监埃瓦尼纳（Bill Evanina）说。 “中国公司与中国政府之间的关系并不像西方私人企业与政府的关系。” “严格监管” 华为一直否认遭到中国政府控制，也否认其工作存在间谍和破坏活动的风险。该公司创始人最近接受BBC采访时重申了这些说法。 华为创始人任正非：“美国无法扼杀我们” 对华为参与本国5G网络，澳大利亚和新西兰在不同程度上持负面态度，加拿大仍在考虑，现在所有的目光都聚焦在英国。 英国国家网络安全中心负责人马丁（Ciaran Martin）周三（2月20日）在布鲁塞尔的一次讲话中称，根据目前与华为合作的经验，已经制定了测试5G安全性的框架。他说，对华为来说，目前的监管制度“可以说是全球‘最难最严苛的’”。 他手下的官员表示，已经发现华为“安全性和工程技术很差”，但仍有迹象表明，英国可能与华为在5G方面展开合作。 如果英国与华为开展5G合作，那么其他国家——不仅包括“五眼联盟”，还有欧盟和北约——很可能会效仿，因为英国的审查记录可以作为参照。有前官员警告，这可能带来严重后果。 英国国家网络安全中心负责人马丁 英国前外交官帕顿（Charles Parton）在一篇新论文中称：“英国若与华为合作，对英国网络安全性的担忧可能会导致‘五眼联盟’以及如法国、德国或日本等其他国家未来不太愿意与英国合作。” “维持电信网络安全的'五眼标准'是一项至关重要的战略和安全利益，失去该保障将比情报交换报告减少更严重，并可能导致英国被排除在开发未来情报收集技术的工作之外。” “适应力是关键” 英国与华为的特殊关系始于21世纪初，当时英国电信正在升级其网络，而华为的报价比其他家便宜数亿英镑。 英国电信对政府表示，他们计划跟华为合作，除非政府愿意补偿。尽管华为并未进入网络核心和敏感系统，但出于对其安全性的担忧，加上其他公司越来越多地使用华为的服务，数年后英国创建了“The Cell”来评估华为英国产品的安全性。 因为华为在安全以及工艺流程方面存在严重问题，“The Cell”最新一份监管报告调低了华为相关的风险担保级别。 不过马丁在其讲话中说，报告中的这些内容并不是中国进行敌对活动的证据。华为表示，未来几年将投资解决这些担忧。英国官员则表示，他们迄今未看到“一个可信的计划”。 尽管如此，种种迹象表明，英国希望顶住来自美国的压力，继续与华为在5G领域开展合作。预计未来两个月，部长们会做出决定。 “关键看容忍程度，”马丁在布鲁塞尔表示。 “供应商市场必须具备可持续的多样性。” 有一个信号是，尽管英国可能与华为合作，但它对自己依赖的一家主导企业持谨慎态度。批评人士担忧，华为也许有中国政府支持，长期而言会通过打入发展中国家市场和制定5G标准，逐渐占据主导地位。5G最大的挑战之一是成本。 巨大的成本 在许多国家，电信公司为5G技术支付的费用远高于预期。他们现在会研究数字，并表明他们倾向更便宜的供应商华为。 英国的电信运营商说，5G与4G在一个高度集成的系统中工作，排除华为不现实，因为这意味着巨大的金钱和时间成本，最终导致英国处于落后地位。 与该公司断绝关系还可能对中英关系产生重大影响。这会给面临脱欧的英国带来挑战。 问题是，如果英国不跟随美国，如果其他国家效仿英国与华为合作，美国和特朗普政府会如何反应。目前英国可能正寻求与美国达成脱欧后的贸易协议。 这可能会让英国进退两难，这次关于华为的决定也会给历来关系密切的“五眼联盟”带来压力。"
"By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website Under the scheme, 11 Genomics Medicine Centres are being set up in English hospitals to gather DNA samples to help devise targeted treatments for a wide range of diseases. It is focusing on cancer and rare genetic diseases. The aim is to sequence 100,000 genomes within three years in order to develop new tests and drugs. Doctors will offer suitable patients the opportunity to take part in the scheme. They will have to agree to have their genetic code and medical records - stripped of anything that could identify them - made available to drugs companies and researchers. Up to 25,000 cancer patients will have the genetic code of their healthy tissue compared to the genetic code of their tumour. A giant game of spot-the-difference will then take place to identify the precise mutations in DNA that are causing a patient's tumour. This would allow targeted medicines to be developed. Genetic code Previous genetics research has shown how different cancers can be - for example that breast cancer is not one disease but at least 10 - each with a different cause and life expectancy and each needing a different treatment. And the development of targeted drugs such as Herceptin - given only if a patient's breast tumour has a certain mutation - has been possible because of genetics research. Meanwhile, 15,000 patients with rare diseases will have their genome compared with those of their parents and grandparents. Thousands of genetic diseases - which are individually rare but combined affect large numbers of people - could be identified by finding mistakes in the three billion pairs of letters that make up our genetic code. The resulting knowledge could give patients an explanation for a disease that has plagued their entire life. Prof Graeme Black, who will lead the project in Manchester, told the BBC: ""It's possible to sequence an individual's entire genetic make-up, their genome, in merely a few days where five years ago that was completely unimaginable. ""Therefore it's possible for conditions where there's a possibility that it's genetic, that we can identify genetic causes much quicker than had been imagined previously."" Case study Edward Sherley-Price has first-hand experience of just how little is known about some conditions. His 11-year-old daughter Alysia has regular seizures. She was diagnosed with a developmental delay before her second birthday, but the cause was unknown. It took until 2013 for genetic testing to discover what was wrong - a rare genetic mutation in a gene known as STXBP1. The family say getting a diagnosis has given them a renewed sense of optimism. The 100,000 Genomes Project could help people like Alysia by identifying a specific mutation, which lead to taking part in future drug trials. The NHS said it was aiming to be the most scientifically advanced healthcare system in the world. Target treatment The 11 Genomics Medicines Centres will open across England in February at: The 11 centres are just the first wave of the project, which will eventually cover the whole of England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not taking part. The pilots have been under way this year and 3,000 genomes will have been sequenced by January. All the data produced in the 100,000 Genomes project will be stripped of anything that could identify the patient and then be made available to drugs companies and researchers to help them create precision drugs for future generations. The project's leaders say it will be the partnership between the health service, industry and academics that will deliver a new era of genetics-based medicine. 'Devastating diseases' NHS England medical director Prof Bruce Keogh said the impact of genomic medicine will be on the same scale as other British successes including the smallpox vaccine and IVF. He said: ""Our NHS is better equipped for the emerging science that will determine the future practice of medicine than any other Western healthcare system. ""[It] puts us in a position to unlock a series of secrets about devastating diseases, that have remained hidden for centuries, for the whole of human kind."" Life sciences minister George Freeman said: ""We want to make the UK the best place in the world to design and discover 21st century medicines."" Angela Douglas, chairwoman of the British Society of Genetic Medicine, said: ""The challenge of the project will be to embed its outcomes into routine health practice. ""The genetics community looks forward to working with researchers, scientists, associated medical specialists and Genomics England to meet that challenge.""",英国国民保健服务NHS说，一项新的基因工程将有助于揭开一系列重大疾病的发病秘密。,"英国计划项新的基因工程，将有助于揭开一系列重大疾病的发病秘密。 根据NHS的这一计划，将在英格兰各地多家医院设立11个基因医学中心，主要是收集DNA样本，以帮助制定一系列重病的靶向治疗。 这一靶向治疗主要针对癌症和罕见的疾病，包括遗传疾病。 该工程计划在3年内排出100,000组基因的序列，以发展新的测试方式和新的药物。 医生们将向符合条件的患者提供参与这一基因工程的机会。 参与者必须同意让制药公司和研究机构使用自己的基因密码和治疗记录，当然这些基因密码和治疗记录是经过防止识别患者身份处理的。 研究人员将把多达25,000名癌症患者身上的健康组织的基因密码，与他们的癌症肿瘤部分的基因密码作比较。 比较的目的是为了能准确的找出导致癌变的细胞造成突变的DNA，以发展靶向治疗的药物或方法。 过去的基因研究结果显示了癌症类型之多，仅乳腺癌就有多达10种以上，而且各种乳腺癌的起因、存活期和治疗方法都有很大的不同。 比如已经广泛用于某种类型的乳腺癌治疗的药物赫赛汀，就是基于基因研究的基础之上，才使这一靶向治疗的可能性成为了现实。 与此同时，15,000名罕见疾病的患者也将参与这一基因项目，研究人员将把他们的基因密码与他们的父母和祖父母的基因作对比。 对罕见疾病患者的基因研究结果，将可用来解释为什么这些患者会有这样罕见的疾病。 （编译：嵇伟/责编：郱书）"
"By Judith BurnsBBC News education reporter Ucas admissions data from mid-December show applications from English students at their lowest since 2009. The trebling of maximum tuition fees saw a drop in applications for autumn 2012 but university leaders hoped demand would recover in 2013. A Ucas spokesman said it was too early to say whether overall applications would be down. The general deadline for applying to start university in autumn 2013 is 15 January, although people may apply later. These interim figures were collated by Ucas on 17 December, by which time some 265,730 people living in the UK had applied to start degree courses this autumn, down 6.3% on the same point in 2012. Application slump Among students living in England, applications were down 6.5% on 2012 at 229,932. The steepest drop in applications was from students living in Wales, down 11.7% to 11,218. Applications from Scottish students fell by 3.9% while there was a marginal increase in applications in Northern Ireland - up 0.5%. The Ucas spokesman stressed that the December sampling point was a few days before the end of term for many schools and suggested that many applications would have come in after that. 'A snapshot' He pointed out that in previous years up to 40% of applications have come in during the final month before the deadline. Pam Tatlow, chief executive of university group Million+ said: ""The worrying trend of falling university applications continues, according to the most recent statistics published by UCAS. ""We urge the government to step in with a national campaign to promote the value of university for potential students currently considering their options, whether they are about to leave school or considering a university course later in life."" But Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of universities, agreed with UCAS that it was too early in the year to judge overall application figures. ""Let's not jump the gun... It's only right that prospective students are taking their time deciding which universities to apply to and making use of all the information available to them."" Nicola Dandridge of Universities UK said the December figures were ""a snapshot"" but warned: ""We must be concerned about any drops in the numbers applying to university and in particular, we must look closely at how the increase in graduate contributions in England may be affecting the decisions of prospective students. ""The December figures show a drop in numbers across the UK, suggesting that it is not solely a question of tuition fees in England putting students off from applying."" 'Bottom line' University and College Union general secretary Sally Hunt said: ""The bottom line is that hiking up the cost is likely to have an impact on people's decisions when it comes to further study. ""We need our brightest people pursuing their dreams. We simply cannot afford to fall behind other countries that are seeing a rise in the number of students and graduates. More must be done to encourage people to aspire to university and far greater efforts made to support them when they are there."" A government spokeswoman said: ""It is too early to form a definitive picture about university applications for the 2013-14 academic year. Traditionally fewer than 50% of applicants have submitted their applications by this point in the cycle. ""It is important that no one is put off applying to university because they do not have information about the student support available to them. Most new students will not pay upfront, there will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments than they do now once they are in well paid jobs."" Applications to UK universities were at their highest in 2011 but dropped by 6.6% last year when the government increased tuition fees to up to £9,000 a year.",官方数据显示，申请上大学的英国学生人数连续第二年下降。,"申请人数的下降可能会令人再次担心高额的大学学费让一些想上大学的学生望而却步。 英国高等院校联合招生服务中心（Ucas）公布的最新统计数据显示，截至去年12月17日，共有265,730名生活在英国的人申请今秋上大学。 这一人数比去年同期下降了6.3%。 申请人数的下降可能会令人再次担心高额的大学学费让一些想上大学的学生望而却步。 仅在英格兰，申请人数就下降了6.5%，只有229,932人在12月17日前登记报名。 其他欧盟国家申请来英国读大学的学生人数也有所减少，申请率下降了1.9%。 但是，在欧盟以外的希望来英国读大学的海外学生人数上升了0.8%。 最新申请人数的减少是连续第二年出现下滑趋势。去年，英国申请上大学的人数也曾出现大幅下降。 在2011年12月中旬，申请在2012年秋季开始学位课程的学生人数是245,882，比上一年减少了7.6%。 去年秋天开始上大学的英格兰学生是首批支付一年9000英镑学费的学生。 总体来讲，申请上大学的人数现在是自2009年以来最低的。在2009年12月中旬，有266,296名学生递交了大学入学申请。 英国大学组织百万+集团（Million+）首席执行官塔特罗（Pam Tatlow）说，大学申请人数下降的趋势令人担忧。我们敦促政府出面干预，展开一次全国范围的宣传行动，推介大学对目前那些仍在举棋不定的学生所具有的价值，无论他们即将离开学校或考虑在晚些时候再上大学。 与内文相关的链接 相关话题"
"She succeeds Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who announced his retirement last year. Ms Dick, previously the national policing lead on counter-terrorism, said she was ""thrilled and humbled"". But her appointment was criticised by the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was wrongly shot dead during an operation she led in 2005. The Brazilian electrician was killed two weeks after the 7/7 London Bombings when he was mistakenly identified as a terror suspect. A jury later found the Met had broken health and safety laws, but found there was ""no personal culpability for Commander Cressida Dick"". Ms Dick, 56, left the Met for the Foreign Office after 31 years of service in December 2014. Londoners' to-do list for the new chief She was chosen for the commissioner's job ahead of National Police Chiefs' Council chairwoman Sara Thornton, Essex Police chief constable Stephen Kavanagh and Scotland Yard's Mark Rowley. Her appointment means that for the first time all three top policing jobs in the UK are held by women: the Met commissioner, the head of the National Crime Agency and the president of the National Police Chief's Council. Ms Dick's statement said: ""This is a great responsibility and an amazing opportunity. ""I'm looking forward immensely to protecting and serving the people of London and working again with the fabulous women and men of the Met. ""Thank you so much to everyone who has taught me and supported me along the way."" Big decisions and intense scrutiny By Danny Shaw, home affairs correspondent The new commissioner will find that when it comes to leading the Met, there's no off-switch. It's a policing organisation like no other in the UK, with a budget of £3bn, a workforce of 43,000 and responsibility for keeping everyone in London - from Barking to Buckingham Palace, from West Norwood to Westminster - safe. The leader of Britain's biggest and most influential police force will come under pressure to make early decisions: on whether to roll out controversial spit-guards, on how to police the Notting Hill Carnival and if Tasers should be extended to all officers. She'll face intense scrutiny from the media, which has a tendency to escalate stories of local difficulties into ones of national importance. And she'll be expected to provide regular updates to the London Assembly, MPs on the home affairs committee, the mayor of London and the home secretary. Five challenges for the new chief Theresa May said Ms Dick had the ""exceptional qualities"" needed to lead the Met. ""Her skills and insights will be crucial in shaping the Met as the job of police reform continues, co-ordinating the national response to the ongoing threat of terrorism and serious criminality as well as keeping Londoners safe,"" the prime minister continued. ""In addition, I know she will be a champion for the most vulnerable who the police are there to protect."" Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Ms Dick was taking on ""one of the most demanding, high-profile and important jobs in UK policing, against the backdrop of a heightened terror alert and evolving threats from fraud and cyber crime"". Sir Bernard said his replacement would be ""a brilliant beacon for women within and beyond this force"". And London Mayor Sadiq Khan said she was the ""best possible person"" to take the Met forward. ""She has already had a long and distinguished career, and her experience and ability has shone throughout this process."" But Mr de Menezes' cousins Patricia Armani and Alex Pereira said her appointment was ""offensive"" to his memory and sent ""the message... that police officers can act with impunity"". Ms Armani said: ""Our family is disappointed that she has now been appointed for such an important role at a time there are many more threats to public security in the form of terrorism. ""What are the guarantees that more innocent people won't be killed by the police in London?"" Rigby killing Ms Dick's new post commands a salary of £270,648, plus benefits. She first joined the Met in 1983 after a brief spell in accountancy following her graduation from Oxford University. In 2009, she became the first woman to be appointed an assistant commissioner at the force, later becoming the national lead for counter-terrorism across the UK. Her work also included leading the reinvestigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and the police response to the killing of soldier Lee Rigby. In 2014, she left Scotland Yard to take up a highly sensitive and undisclosed director-general post at the Foreign Office. Her other experience includes taking on internal reforms of Scotland Yard and being one of the two senior officers in charge of security at the London 2012 Olympic Games.",周四（2月23日）英国多家媒体头版报道了伦敦都会警察局新任命的女局长克丽丝达·狄克。她是伦敦警察局188年来第一位女长官。,"伦敦警察局自1829年成立以来第一次任命一位女性出任最高长官——克丽丝达·狄克。 《卫报》头版报道说，狄克曾在被称为苏格兰场的伦敦都会警察局担任高级职务，两年前她辞去警队职务到英国外交部工作，负责反恐工作。如今她得到英国内政部长和伦敦市长的支持，重回伦敦警队担任一把手。 《卫报》引述一名警队高层官员说，狄克""鼓舞信心""，既能在艰苦的、男性主导的情况下工作，又能与高级政界人士合作。 《每日电讯报》头版标题称她是：警队第一夫人。 《每日电讯报》还刊登社评呼吁警队：执法吧，不要搞政治。该社评认为，现任伦敦警察局局长伯纳德·霍根·霍伊虽然承诺要向罪行宣战，但是他在任期的很多决定却""有明显的政治味道""。他对发生在过去的性指称启动多次调查，以及对记者和消息人士等的调查""毫无结果""，都显示他""不愿追罪犯，却愿上头条""。 《金融时报》头版也刊登狄克的照片，报道着重她上任后面临的财政压力。报道称，在2020年之前，伦敦警队面临经费削减4亿英镑，但却面临越来越大的恐怖主义危险。 《泰晤士报》报道狄克出任伦敦警察局局长的报道中，提及2005年伦敦警察误杀无辜巴西青年梅内泽斯的那次行动的长官正是狄克，不过她在2007年的审讯中被洗脱责任。"
"Public borrowing dropped to £10.5bn last month, down £0.9bn from a year earlier, although analysts had expected the figure to fall further to £10bn. Borrowing in the current financial year to date (April to August) has reached £33.8bn, which is £4.9bn lower than the same point last year. The ONS added there was no clear sign of the Brexit vote affecting figures. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said he may have to reset fiscal policy to offset any negative outcome from the vote. However, he has dampened down talk that he might reveal an increase in public spending when he reveals his Autumn Statement in November. The ONS said receipts from income and corporation taxes rose strongly compared with a year ago, but VAT receipts rose at their slowest annual pace since March 2015. 'Mixed news' Independent research company Capital Economics said the improvement in public finances ""was unlikely to last"". Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""The improvement in the UK public finances in August was partly due to one-off timing factors and is unlikely to continue due to the economic slowdown as a result of the Brexit vote. ""The effect of the apparent slowdown in GDP growth since the vote will instead hit the public finances in coming months."" In March's Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that the government would borrow £55.5bn in the current financial year Howard Archer from IHS Global Insight said the latest borrowing figures were ""mixed news"" for Mr Hammond. ""On the positive side, this adds to the evidence that the economy has been resilient so far following June's Brexit vote, with tax receipts holding up relatively well overall. ""Nevertheless, the public finances are still off track to meet the March Budget target, which highlights the fact that the chancellor really has limited ability to provide a boost to the economy in November's Autumn Statement if he is to maintain a semblance of fiscal discipline.""",最新数据显示，英国通胀率上个月跌到一年来最低点。,汽油和柴油价格下跌推低了消费物价指数和零售物价指数。 10月份消费物价指数（CPI）从前一个月的2.7%降到2.2%，低于预期的2.5%。 零售物价指数（RPI）从9月的3.2%降到2.6%。 英国国家统计局（ONS）认为，通胀率如此大幅下跌，主要原因是机动车燃油价格急跌，导致交通成本出现2009年7月以来最大跌幅。 今年9-10月间，交通成本下跌1.5%，其中一个重要因素是各大超市争相下调汽油、柴油价格。 同时，民航机票价格也有回落动向。 国家统计局说，另一个推低通胀率的主要因素是教育开支。 数据显示，大学学费上涨对通胀造成的影响不如去年那么大。 食品价格涨幅也从4.8%降到4.3%。 市场观察人士注意到原油价格持续疲软，预计今后一段时间将继续对通胀率构成向下压力。 但英国各大煤气电力公司宣布大幅度提高电费和煤气费，估计将在今后几个月的通胀率中得到体现。 英格兰银行的目标通胀率是2%。 央行行长卡尼曾表示，通胀不降到目标水平以下，央行不会考虑提息。 （编译：郱书 责编：铃兰）
"First Lady Rosario Murillo already has a prominent role as the chief government spokeswoman and is widely seen as sharing power with her husband. She appears on Nicaraguan television almost every day. Critics accuse the first couple of running Nicaragua - which has elections in November - like a personal fiefdom. Power couples: Ten presidential spouses who ran for political office While President Ortega rarely speaks to the media, his wife is regularly seen on TV discussing policy and promoting her own brand of New Age spirituality. Mother of the president's seven children, she is fluent in English and French in addition to being a renowned poet. She also has a reputation for wearing colourfully extravagant outfits and jewellery more commonly seen in the hippy 1960s. Correspondents say many Nicaraguans see Ms Murillo as wielding the most power in her country because of her higher public profile. Husband and wife officially submitted their candidacy papers in the capital Managua, accompanied by the legal adviser of their Sandinista party. Hundreds of Sandinista supporters cheered the couple when they left the building. But opposition supporters are concerned her promotion may herald the rise of a new family dynasty in the impoverished Central American nation.

"BBC TrendingGoing in-depth on social media Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) are attempting to access the previously rebel-held town of Douma, where medical organisations and rescue workers say President Bashar al-Assad's forces dropped bombs filled with toxic chemicals in an attack on 7 April, killing more than 40 people. The Syrian government and its key ally, Russia, say the incident was staged. But the US, UK and France - who support the opposition to Mr Assad - say they are confident that chlorine and possibly a nerve agent were used. Despite the uncertainty about what happened in Douma, a cluster of influential social media activists is certain that it knows what occurred on 7 April. They've seized on a theory being floated by Russian officials and state-owned media outlets that the attacks were ""staged"" or were a ""false flag"" operation, carried out by jihadist groups or spies in order to put the blame on the Assad government and provide a justification for Western intervention. The group includes activists and people who call themselves ""independent journalists"", and several have Twitter followings reaching into the tens or hundreds of thousands. You may also be interested in: The activists call themselves ""anti-war"", but as they generally back the Syrian government's military operations against rebel forces seeking to overthrow Mr Assad and Russian air strikes carried out in support, it might be more accurate to describe them as ""anti-Western intervention"" or ""pro-Syrian government"". According to their narrative, international media organisations across the political spectrum, along with human rights organisations, are somehow covertly aligned with Western governments, Saudi Arabia, the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda and taking part in a secretive plot to take over Syria. The network of activists includes people like Vanessa Beeley. She has more than 30,000 Twitter followers and writes for a news outlet that the website Media Bias/Fact Check calls a ""conspiracy and conjecture site"" that has ""an extreme right bias"". In response to a list of questions, she called BBC Trending's story a ""blatant attempt"" to ""silence independent journalism"" and repeated unsubstantiated claims about alleged chemical weapons attacks. Influential accounts Beeley gives talks to fringe groups and makes appearances on media outlets including state-owned Russian channel RT. But in the online conversation about Syria there are more influential activists, about whom much less is known. Sarah Abdallah (@sahouraxo on Twitter) has more than 125,000 followers, among them more than 250 journalists from mainstream media outlets. Her follower count is comparable to BBC journalists who regularly report on Syria, such as BBC Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen (167,000) and BBC Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet (142,000). More from Trending: In addition to pictures of herself, Sarah Abdallah tweets constant pro-Russia and pro-Assad messages, with a dollop of retweeting mostly aimed at attacking Barack Obama, other US Democrats and Saudi Arabia. In her Twitter profile she describes herself as an ""Independent Lebanese geopolitical commentator"" but she has almost no online presence or published stories or writing away from social media platforms. A personal blog linked to by her account has no posts. Her tweets have been quoted by mainstream news outlets, but a Google News search indicates that she has not written any articles in either English or Arabic. She refused to comment several times when approached by BBC Trending and did not respond to specific requests to comment on this story in particular. White Helmets The Sarah Abdallah account is, according to a recent study by the online research firm Graphika, one of the most influential social media accounts in the online conversation about Syria, and specifically in pushing misinformation about a 2017 chemical weapons attack and the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the ""White Helmets"". The White Helmets operate in rebel-held areas. They have been one of the sources that Western media outlets, including the BBC, have quoted about alleged chemical attacks in Syria. With regard to the incident in Douma, the BBC has not been able independently to verify the group's reports. Graphika chief executive John Kelly says his company's analysis showed distinct patterns emerging. ""When you're looking at these disinformation campaigns, a lot of the same characters show up for every party,"" he told BBC Trending. Graphika was commissioned to prepare a report on online chatter by The Syria Campaign, a UK-based advocacy group organisation which campaigns for a democratic future for Syria and supports the White Helmets. The White Helmets have been the subject of two Oscar-nominated documentary films and have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Graphika found 20 million messages about the White Helmets, split between tweets in support and in opposition. Among the opponents, Kelly says, Sarah Abdallah was ""by far the most influential"", followed by Vanessa Beeley. The firm found that Sarah Abdallah's account was primarily followed by a number of different interest clusters: supporters of pro-Palestinian causes, Russians and Russian allies, white nationalists and those from the extremist alt-right, conservative American Trump supporters, far-right groups in Europe and conspiracy theorists. These groups were instrumental in making the hashtag #SyriaHoax trend after the chemical weapons attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017. That hashtag, pushed by Sarah Abdallah and influential American conservative activists, became a worldwide trend on Twitter. Many of those tweeting it claimed that the chemical weapons attack was faked or a hoax. Beeley said the 2017 attack had ""been debunked by a number of highly respected analysts and experts."" She alleged that evidence ""points to the White Helmets as a propaganda construct"" and asked, via email: ""Why has the BBC never carried out an investigation into the White Helmets?"" Experts from a joint UN-OPCW mission said in October 2017 that they were confident a Syrian Air Force jet dropped munitions containing sarin on Khan Sheikhoun, dismissing statements from Russia that the jet had fired conventional munitions at a rebel chemical weapons depot. Drowned out The difficulty in reporting on the ground in Syria has opened up an information vacuum which has been partially filled by highly partisan sources, according to Scott Lucas, a professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham and editor of news and analysis site EA Worldview, ""None of it is journalism; none of it is really based on solid independent reporting,"" Lucas says. ""It is absolutely right to question all narratives, including official narratives of what is happening,"" he says. ""The key is that you don't actually start with a narrative, you start with the facts and you establish what may not be true and what may even be disinformation. ""The danger we face is, unreliable information is now being taken up by more established - and what we would think of as - more reliable outlets,"" he says. Syria 'chemical attack': What we know And although the activists' follower accounts continue to grow, there is one indication that their influence online might be on the decline compared with last year. In the hours after the alleged attack in Douma, ""Syria"" was a top trending term on Twitter, but the messages by pro-Assad activists were drowned out by reports from a range of news outlets. The hashtag #SyriaHoax was used around 17,000 times in a week (compared to more than 280,000 times in April 2017), and mostly failed to make Twitter's lists of top trends. Do you have a story for us?

"Debbie Martin passed away at the Palomar Medical Centre in Escondido on Sunday, aged 61, the hospital said. Mrs Martin was the sister of Jolie's mother Marcheline Bertrand, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007, aged 56. Her husband, Ron Martin, said the sisters had both had the same mutated BRCA1 gene, which Jolie inherited. ""Angelina has been in touch throughout the week and her brother Jamie has been with us, giving his support day by day,"" he told E! News. ""They both loved Debbie very much and although Angie is not able to come right now, she has sent her love and support, which was very nice."" Mr Martin also praised the actress for electing to have a double mastectomy, telling the Associated Press: ""Had we known, we certainly would have done exactly what Angelina did."" On 14 May, the 37-year-old wrote in the New York Times that she had had the operation after doctors estimated she had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer. ""I decided to be proactive and to minimise the risk as much I could,"" she explained, adding that her chances of developing breast cancer had now dropped to less than 5%.

"Few expected that the little-known vice-president who was elevated to the presidency in the wake of Anwar Sadat's 1981 assassination would hold on to the country's top job for so long. Sadat was assassinated by Islamist militants at a military parade in Cairo, and Mr Mubarak was lucky to escape the shots as he sat next to him. Since then, he has survived at least six assassination attempts - the narrowest escape shortly after his arrival in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, in 1995 to attend an African summit, when his limousine came under attack. Besides his knack for dodging bullets, the former air force commander also managed to keep a hold on power by positioning himself as a trusted Western ally and fighting off a powerful opposition movement at home. It all came to an end in a televised address on 1 February 2011, following mass protests in Cairo and other cities. Mr Mubarak announced he had decided not to stand for re-election later that year. Protests continued and on 10 February he appeared on state television to say he was handing over powers to his vice-president, but would remain as president. The following day Vice-President Omar Suleiman made a terse announcement saying Mr Mubarak was stepping down and the military's supreme council would run the country. 'I have a good conscience' By late May 2011, judicial officials announced that Mr Mubarak, along with his two sons - Alaa and Gamal - would stand trial over the deaths of anti-government protesters. So began a protracted series of court appearances - with the former president often been seen in the dock in an upright stretcher wearing his trademark sunglasses. He has steadfastly argued his innocence - telling a retrial in August that that he was approaching the end of his life ""with a good conscience"". On 2 June 2012 he was found guilty of complicity in the murder of some of the demonstrators who took part in the wave of protests that began on 25 January 2011. Along with his former Interior Minister, Habib al-Adly, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for his crimes. In January 2013 a court upheld an appeal against Mr Mubarak's and Mr al-Adly's convictions and granted retrials. Mr Mubarak and his sons were also ordered to be retried on corruption charges for which they were originally acquitted. Mr Mubarak was released from prison in August that year but placed under house arrest before being transferred to a military hospital. In May 2014, Mubarak was found guilty of embezzlement, and sentenced to three years in prison. Alaa and Gamal were sentenced to four years each. The convictions were overturned in January 2015, but a retrial reinstated the same sentences. An appeals court upheld the sentences a year later, but Alaa and Gamal were freed because of time already served. In November 2014, Mr Mubarak was finally acquitted in a retrial of conspiring to kill protesters during the 2011 uprising. At the same time, he was also acquitted of corruption charges involving gas exports to Israel. In March 2017 Egypt's top appeals court upheld Mr Mubarak's acquittal and he went free, for the first time in six years. A strict personal life Born in 1928 in a small village in Menofya province near Cairo, Muhammad Hosni Sayyid Mubarak insisted on keeping his private life out of the public domain while president. Married to a half-British graduate of the American University in Cairo, Suzanne Mubarak, he was known to lead a strict life with a fixed daily schedule that began at 0600. Never a smoker or a drinker, he built himself a reputation as a fit man who led a healthy life. In his younger days, close associates often complained of the president's schedule, which began with a workout in the gym or a game of squash. He was sworn in as president on 14 October 1981, eight days after the Sadat assassination. Despite having little popular appeal or international profile at the time, the burly military man used his sponsorship of the issue behind Sadat's killing - peace with Israel - to build up his reputation as an international statesman. Egypt's quasi-military leader In effect, Mr Mubarak ruled as a quasi-military leader when he took power. For his entire period in office, he kept the country under emergency law, giving the state sweeping powers of arrest and curbing basic freedoms. The government argued the draconian regime was necessary to combat Islamist terrorism, which came in waves during the decades of Mr Mubarak's rule - often targeting Egypt's lucrative tourism sector. He presided over a period of domestic stability and economic development that meant most of his fellow countrymen accepted his monopolisation of power. But towards the end of his tenure in power, Mr Mubarak felt for the first time the pressure to encourage democracy, both from within Egypt, and from his most powerful ally, the United States. Many supporters of reform doubted the veteran ruler's sincerity when he said he was all for opening up the political process. Ahead of his declaration that he would not to stand again for the presidency, the US had heaped pressure on him to stand aside, calling for an ""orderly transition"" of power to a more democratic system. Mr Mubarak won three elections unopposed since 1981, but for his fourth contest in 2005 - after a firm push from the US - he changed the system to allow rival candidates. Critics said the election was heavily weighted in favour of Mr Mubarak and the National Democratic Party (NDP). They accused the Egyptian leader of presiding over a sustained campaign of suppressing 'History will judge me' The length of his time in power, along with his age and possible successors, had all been sensitive subjects in Egypt until the mass protests allowed the Egyptian people to find a voice. People around Mr Mubarak said his health and vigour belied his age - although a couple of health scares served as a reminder of his advancing years. Rumours about the president's health gathered pace when he travelled to Germany in March 2010 for gall bladder surgery. They flared every time he missed a key gathering or disappeared from the media spotlight for any conspicuous length of time. However much Egyptian officials tried to deny them, they kept circulating, with reports in the Israeli and pan-Arab media. The days of mass protests in Egyptian cities prompted Mr Mubarak to finally name a vice-president. On 29 January 2011, intelligence chief Omar Suleiman was elevated to the role in what was seen as an attempt by Mr Mubarak to bolster his support in the military. Two weeks later Mr Mubarak's three-decade rule was over, and in March he was under arrest. In the past, Mr Mubarak had said he would continue to serve Egypt until his last breath. In his speech on 1 February 2011, he said: ""This dear nation... is where I lived, I fought for it and defended its soil, sovereignty and interests. On its soil I will die. History will judge me like it did others.""",埃及目前的局势如此地似曾相识。2011年2月，执政了30年的穆巴拉克在民众抗议中被迫下台。,埃及局势不稳军方向总统发出最后通牒 而现在，一切仿佛又回到从前：街头民众抗议要求总统下台；军方小心谨慎不偏离民心所向；总统绝不屈服，表示将不向国内和国际压力低头下台；美国总统则促请埃及总统倾听民众的声音。 对美国政府来说，现在与当年一样左右为难：究竟是要埃及局势稳定还是尊重民众的意愿。 与两年前的情况不同也是非常关键的因素是：穆尔西不是穆巴拉克，他是2012年6月在埃及那场公平、自由、竞争激烈的大选中获胜当选的总统。 另外还有一点不同是，抗议者高举的奥巴马和美国大使的头像都被大大地划了个叉。 尽管穆尔西当政后越来越专权，美国一直都坚持表示尊重大选的结果，这么一来也就惹恼了埃及那些近一半没有投票支持穆尔西的民众。 转向 在埃及新的抗议示威中，华盛顿的立场过去几天也在发生转变。埃及前外交官表示，埃及街头的情况在左右着美国的政策。 当年，奥巴马曾多次向穆巴拉克喊话，敦促他倾听民意，警告他不听民意的后果。穆巴拉克没有理睬奥巴马的呼吁，埃及军方最终悄悄介入，导致了穆巴拉克的下台，以及后来的军人看守政府和再其后的穆尔西当选。 现在，尽管华盛顿对穆尔西非常疑虑，但同时也担心他的不妥协会导致军事政变，让过去两年恢复文人政府的所有努力泡汤。 周一，奥巴马致电穆尔西表示“美国致力于埃及的民主进程，不支持任何一个政党或团体”。 奥巴马还告诉穆尔西，“民主并非仅仅限于选举，民主还包括确保政府听到所有埃及人民的声音并代表他们的利益。” 奥巴马希望穆尔西表示出他认真考虑了抗议者的诉求。 平衡 不过，穆尔西似乎对美国方面的“甜言蜜语”无动于衷。穆斯林兄弟会透过穆尔西发出的信号是：宁愿抗争也不放权。 尽管如此，美国方面的方式方法也让埃及反对派更加不相信美国，他们中很多人都认为白宫支持穆斯林兄弟会，不过，反过来证明这一说法并不成立的是，美国当局在穆巴拉克下台前从来没有接触过穆斯林兄弟会。 分析人士指出，华盛顿认为，只要接受了选举结果，就能弥补过去在埃及支持独裁专制政权的错误，消除多年以来埃及人对美国的不信任。但是美国不能理解穆斯林派系的总统上台对埃及人造成的创伤有多大，美国人也不知道埃及人看到美国与这样的总统建立合作关系时有多么吃惊。 2006年，美国布什政府时期曾经推动在巴勒斯坦领土的选举，但因为哈马斯赢得多数议席结果美国不接受那次选举。美国国务院还将哈马斯列为恐怖主义组织。 布什政府的做法在中东地区受到批评，人们认为美国只支持他们喜欢的民主选举结果。 分析人士认为，这次奥巴马政府的做法也过火。在与穆尔西合作与批评他两者之间没有找到平衡。 如今，在埃及继续面临局势不稳甚至血腥暴力之时，美国既担心埃及局势不稳、也担心伊斯兰势力上升、更担心埃及可能发生军事政变。 如此一来，就如2011年时一样，美国军方官员又开始了与埃及军方的电话联系。 美国方面或许希望，即便埃及军方介入政局，也应该以一种保护民主的姿态。根据美国的法律，如果发生政变，美国必须终止对埃及的13亿美元军事援助。
"It said this would ""not significantly alter"" the spread of the virus, which is linked to serious birth defects. In an open letter to the WHO, more than 100 leading scientists had said new findings about Zika made it ""unethical"" for the Games to go ahead. They also said the global health body should revisit its Zika guidance. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said it sees no reason to delay or move the Games because of the mosquito-borne disease. The outbreak began in Brazil a year ago, but now more than 60 countries and territories have continuing transmission. Between February and April 2016, Brazil's health ministry registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus. The number of babies born with Zika-linked defects stood at 4,908 in April. While Zika's symptoms are mild, in the letter the experts say it causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and may also cause a rare and sometimes fatal neurological syndrome in adults. The letter is signed by 150 international scientists, doctors and medical ethicists from such institutions as Oxford University and Harvard and Yale universities in the United States. They cite the failure of a mosquito-eradication programme in Brazil, and the country's ""weakened"" health system as reasons to postpone or move the Olympics in ""the name of public health"". More on the Zika crisis: Microcephaly: Why it is not the end of the world What you need to know Key questions answered about the virus and its spread Travel advice Countries affected and what you should do The mosquito behind Zika What we know about the insect Abortion dilemma Laws and practices in Catholic Latin America ""An unnecessary risk is posed when 500,000 foreign tourists from all countries attend the Games, potentially acquire that strain, and return home to places where it can become endemic,"" the letter says. The biggest risk, it adds, is if athletes contract the virus and returned home to poor countries that have not yet suffered a Zika outbreak. They also express concern the WHO has a conflict of interest because of its partnership with the IOC. The Rio Olympics are due to take place between 5 and 21 August. In a statement, the WHO, which has declared the Zika virus a global public health emergency, said: ""Brazil is one of almost 60 countries and territories which to date report continuing transmission of Zika by mosquitoes. ""People continue to travel between these countries and territories for a variety of reasons. The best way to reduce risk of disease is to follow public health travel advice."" Several public health experts had previously warned that hundreds of thousands of people arriving in Rio would speed up Zika's spread and lead to the births of brain-damaged babies. But on Thursday, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), whose advice is quoted approvingly in the letter, said the threat did not warrant halting the Games. ""There is no public health reason to cancel or delay the Olympics,"" Dr Tom Frieden said. However, he urged the US to act more quickly to prevent pregnant women contracting Zika, amid congressional deadlock over the release of $1.9bn (£1.3bn) in funding. And virology researcher Oliver Brady, from Oxford University, said the risk was comparatively low because the Olympics would take place during Brazil's winter. ""We really think August is about 20 to 40 times lower risk than we see around now or in January where we see these large numbers of cases reported from Rio,"" he told the BBC. The Olympics have never been moved for public health reasons but Fifa relocated its 2003 Women's World Cup from China to the US because of the Sars epidemic.",世界卫生组织（WHO）已经否决了今夏的里约奥运会应该因寨卡疫情而延期或易地举办的建议。,按计划，里约奥运会将在8月举行 世卫表示，延期或易地举办对于病毒的传播情况“不会带来重大改变”。 较早前，超过100名顶尖科学家向世卫发出了公开信，表示关于寨卡病毒的新发现使得如期举行奥运会变得“不道德”。 他们还表示，世卫组织应该重新审议有关寨卡病毒的指引。 寨卡病毒主要由伊蚊传播，被认为可以导致新生婴儿缺陷。 国际奥委会（IOC）在此前已曾表示，看不到任何理由要延期或易地举办奥运会。 寨卡疫情一年前开始在巴西爆发，现在已经有超过60个国家和地区持续有感染的情况。 虽然寨卡病毒的症状通常较轻，但是在公开信中，专家指这种病会导致初生婴儿出现畸形的小头症，并且还可能导致成人出现罕见的神经系统疾病，在一些病例中可能致命。 公开信由150名不同国籍的科学专家、医生和医学伦理学者联合签署，包括牛津、哈佛、耶鲁等高等学府均有学者参与联署。 他们在信中指出了巴西灭蚊措施的不成功，以及该国医疗卫生系统能力被削弱，都是“以公共卫生之名”延迟或易地举办奥运会的理由。 公开信说：“当50万各国旅客来到奥运会的时候，就成了不必要的风险，他们有可能感染病毒，携带回国，病毒在那些地方可能成为疫症。” 信中还说，最大的风险是，如果运动员感染病毒，将之带回尚未爆发寨卡疫情的落后国家。 他们还对世卫组织可能在利益上有冲突而表示担忧，因为世卫与国际奥委会有合作关系。 按计划，里约奥运会将在8月5日至21日进行。 已经宣布寨卡病毒为全球公共卫生紧急状况的世卫组织在一份声明中说：“至目前为止，有近60个国家和地区报告了伊蚊持续传播寨卡病毒的情况，而巴西是其中之一。” “由于很多的原因，人们会继续在这些国家和地区之间出行。降低疾病风险的最佳方法是跟随旅行健康指引。” 有专家认为，巴西国内的灭蚊及医疗卫生系统可能不足以阻止寨卡病毒传播 此前，数名公共卫生专家曾警告，数以十万计的人到访里约，将会加速寨卡病毒的蔓延，导致更多新生婴儿出现大脑缺陷。 但是在周四，美国疾病控制与预防中心（US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention，简称CDC）的负责人表示，寨卡病毒的威胁没有达到要阻碍奥运会进行的程度。 “没有公共卫生方面的理由需要取消或者延期举行奥运会，”汤姆·弗里登博士（Dr Tom Frieden）说。 不过，他同时敦促美国采取更迅速的行动避免孕妇感染寨卡病毒，美国国会目前正为19亿美元（13亿英镑）的相关资金僵持不下。
"By Ana Nicolaci da Costa Business reporter The US has been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade battle on several fronts over the past few months. The one that's creating the most interest is the one with China, as the world's two largest economies wrangle for global influence. Some say President Trump is trying to raise pressure on China ahead of key mid-term elections at home in November. In the latest move, China said on Friday that it would levy new tariffs on more than 5,200 US products if the US goes ahead with its latest threat to impose 25% tariffs on $200bn (£152bn) of Chinese goods. Earlier this year, the US also started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium, including from the European Union, Mexico, and Canada. These countries have retaliated. Here are some of the main sectors finding themselves victims of the trade war so far. Cars and motorbikes The car industry seems to have been the most affected so far, with three major automakers recently warning that changes to trade policies are hurting performance. Ford and General Motors lowered profit forecasts for 2018, citing higher steel and aluminium prices caused by new US tariffs. Fiat Chrysler also cut its 2018 revenue outlook after sales in China slumped, as buyers postponed purchases in anticipation of lower car tariffs. In May, China announced that it would cut tariffs on imported cars from 25% to 15% on 1 July in a move seen as an attempt to reduce trade tensions with the US. But shortly after, on 6 July, it increased tariffs on US-made cars to 40% in retaliation to the US's move to tax $34bn of Chinese products. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's biggest car firm, also recently reported a loss for the first time in three years after sales slowed down in China. Among the reasons, it said many consumers had delayed purchases due to a change in Chinese import duties. European and US car companies are also responding by increasing prices in China. BMW recently said it would raise prices on two of its models from 30 July due to the increased import duty on US-made cars in China. Tesla has also reportedly increased prices on two of its models. However, there has also been a positive impact for China, as Anna-Marie Baisden, head of autos research at Fitch Solutions, points out. ""We have seen a number of carmakers, including Tesla, accelerating plans to invest in local production facilities to avoid import tariffs,"" she says. Other firms in the broader industry are also considering their options. ""Ironically some of the hardest-hit companies are American or producing in the US, even though the tariffs imposed by the US are intended to help domestic companies,"" says Ms Baisden. US motorcyle maker Harley-Davidson plans to shift some production away from the US to avoid the ""substantial"" burden of European Union tariffs, imposed in retaliation to US duties on steel and aluminium. Food and drink Some companies in the food and drinks industry are also lowering their outlooks and putting up their prices to cope with the new status quo. Tyson Foods recently cut its profit forecast, saying retaliatory duties on US pork and beef exports had lowered US meat prices. US spirits and wine giant Brown-Forman has said it will increase the price of Jack Daniel's and other whiskeys in some European countries, according to media reports. Coca-Cola has also said it will increase prices in North America this year to compensate for higher freight rates and metal prices, according to the Wall Street Journal. Other victims Other companies are seeking to do less business with China as a way of avoiding the tariffs. Toymaker Hasbro is moving more production out of China, US conglomerate Honeywell wants to use more supply chain sources from countries outside China and home furnishing company RH expects to cut the amount of goods sourced from China, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, US equipment maker Caterpillar recently said strong demand had allowed it to hike prices to offset $100m-$200m in higher steel and aluminium costs. World economy The International Monetary Fund says an escalation of the tit-for-tat tariffs could shave 0.5% off global growth by 2020. Separate releases recently showed growth in China's manufacturing sector slowing in July and one measure of US consumer sentiment falling due to tariff concerns, according to media reports. Morgan Stanley estimates that a full-blown escalation of the trade dispute could knock 0.81 percentage points off global gross domestic product. This scenario would involve the US slapping 25% tariffs on all goods from both China and the EU, and them responding with similar measures. The bank said most of the effect from tariff hikes on growth would probably be seen only in 2019. Most of the impact - or almost 80% - would come through a disruption of domestic and international supply chains, the bank added.",伴随以美国为主的贸易战不断发展，有一些公司已经感觉到疼痛。,"美国与中国是割裂的两极吗？ 过去几个月，美国在多个战线卷入针锋相对的贸易战。 其中最吸引关注的是与中国之间的纠纷，当今世界最大的两个经济体为争夺全球影响力互不相让。一些人认为，在美国11月中期选举前，特朗普会继续试图给中国施压。 就在上周，中国宣布，如果美国对中国约2,000亿美元的商品征收25%关税，中国也将对5,207个税目的美国商品征收关税。 今年早些时候，美国开始对从欧盟、墨西哥、加拿大进口的钢铁和铝征收关税。而这些国家和地区也进行了还击。 以下是这场贸易战目前为止的“受害者”们。 汽车与摩托车 汽车行业可能是目前为止受影响最大的领域。福特、通用汽车、菲亚特等三家主要汽车生产商最近警告称，贸易政策的改变已经开始影响业绩。 由于美国新征关税导致钢铁和铝的价格上涨，福特与通用汽车已经下调2018年盈利预期。 期待汽车进口关税下调的心态也阻止了中国人的消费，导致菲亚特汽车在中国销量下滑，菲亚特也下调了2018年盈利预期。 今年5月，中国宣布从7月1日起将把进口车关税从25%下调至15%，外界将此解读为减少与美国的贸易争端之举。然而在美国对3,400亿美元中国商品加征关税后，中国将美国进口车关税上调至40%作为回击。 英国最大汽车公司捷豹路虎（Jaguar Land Rover）最近也出现三年来的首次亏损，且中国销量开始放缓。捷豹路虎表示，中国进口关税变化导致消费者推迟购买计划是其中原因之一。 捷豹路虎中国销量出现放缓。 受中国进口车关税影响，欧洲和美国的汽车企业均在中国上调售价。 宝马（BMW）近来表示，由于中国对美国制造汽车增加进口关税，旗下两款车型售价自7月30日起上调。有报道称特斯拉（Tesla）两款车型售价也有上涨。 不过惠誉解决方案（Fitch Solutions）汽车研究部门主管安娜·拜斯登（Anna-Marie Baisden）指出，这对中国也有积极影响。 “我们已经看到，为避免进口关税，包括特斯拉在内的一些汽车制造商在加速推进当地的生产设施投资计划，”她说。 全行业还有一些公司也在考虑其它选项。 “比较讽刺的是，尽管美国征收的关税意在帮助本国企业，但受打击最严重的公司中，有一些是美国公司，或者生产流程在美国的公司，”拜斯登表示。 为反击美国对钢铁和铝征收关税，欧盟决定对美国摩托车征收额外关税，此举导致美国摩托车制造商哈雷戴维森（Harley-Davidson）计划将部分生产线搬出美国，以避免欧盟关税带来的“重大”负担。 食品饮料 为应对新局面，食品与饮料行业的一些公司也在下调预期，提高价格。 泰森食品（Tyson Foods）表示，由于他国对美国猪肉、牛肉征收报复性关税，美国肉价下跌，因此调低本公司盈利预期。 另据媒体报道，美国酒业巨头白富门（Brown-Forman）决定调高杰克丹尼（Jack Daniel's）等威士忌在一些欧洲国家的售价。 《华尔街日报》报道称，可口可乐也表示今年将在北美涨价，以弥补运费和金属价格上涨带来的影响。 受成本增加影响，可口可乐将在北美涨价。 其他受害者 为避开关税，还有一些公司正在尝试减少与中国的生意往来。 根据路透社消息，玩具制造商孩之宝（Hasbro）正在将更多生产线搬离中国，美国互联工业企业霍尼韦尔（Honeywell）计划更多利用中国以外国家的供应链资源，而家具企业RH则打算减少从中国引入的商品数量。 与此同时，美国生产设备制造商卡特彼勒（Caterpillar）近来表示，强劲的市场需求使其可以通过提高价格抵消钢铁和铝成本上涨导致的1亿至2亿美元成本。 世界经济 国际货币基金组织（IMF）指出，如果各国针锋相对的关税争端继续升级，可能导致2020年全球经济增长减少0.5%。 根据媒体报道，最近单独发布的数据显示，7月中国制造业增长放缓，而受关税影响，美国消费者信心指数出现下降。 摩根士丹利（Morgan Stanley）估计，如果贸易争端全面升级，可能导致全球GDP下降0.81个百分点。而所谓的全面升级，即美国对来自中国和欧盟的所有商品征收25%关税，中国和欧盟以类似措施反击。 摩根士丹利表示，关税上调对经济增长的大部分影响可能要等2019年才能显现出来。而其中大部分，或者说接近80%的影响，将是国内和国际供应链中断。"
"The group - headed by Tom Tugendhat, a prominent critic of China's response to the pandemic - aims to ""promote debate and fresh thinking"". He said the China Research Group would not be ""anti-China"". It would ""explore opportunities to engage with"" the country and examine its economic aims, Mr Tugendhat added. ""The coronavirus crisis underlines the urgent need for a better understanding of China's place in the world, and our economic and diplomatic engagement with it,"" said the Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling. ""Beijing's long pattern of information suppression has contributed to the unfolding crisis. The (Chinese Communist) Party are now using the current emergency to build influence around the world."" 'Falsified data' On Friday, Mr Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, accused the Chinese Communist Party of putting its own survival ahead of that of the survival of people during the coronavirus outbreak. He told Radio 4's the World At One: ""The one thing that really marks out the Chinese Communist Party is not that they didn't have sufficient data, but that they deliberately falsified the data."" Despite receiving praise for its handling of coronavirus from the World Health Organisation, many, including US President Donald Trump, have accused the Chinese authorities of manipulating information and failing to adequately warn other countries about its deadly nature. Chen Wen, Minister and First Staff Member of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, defended China's response to the initial outbreak in Wuhan, saying the shutdown of the city had reduced the spread to other countries ""by 77%"". ""Chinese people have paid a high price for that,"" she added. 'Politically motivated' On the alleged spreading of disinformation on the origins of the virus, Ms Chen said it was ""maybe as dangerous as the virus itself, if not even more"" and that ""solidarity"" and ""cooperation"" is the only way to beat the virus. She hit back at calls for an international inquiry into China's handling of coronavirus outbreak, saying it would be ""politically motivated"" and would not do anybody ""any good"". Mr Tugendhat said his new group, which includes eight other Tory MPs, including former cabinet minister Damian Green, would attempt to look beyond the pandemic to examine China's long-term economic and diplomatic aims. In reference to the controversy surrounding the government's decision to allow Chinese technology firm Huawei access to the UK's 5G network, the group will look at the consequences of new technology and who owns platforms. It will also examine China's foreign policy, particularly in relation to the world's poorer regions.",由英国保守党议员组成的一个小组表示，新冠病毒危机结束后，英国需要更好地了解中国的经济野心和全球角色。,图根哈特（Tom Tugendhat）坚称，他和支持者并非“反华”。 这个小组由英国议会下院外交事务委员会主席、保守党议员汤姆‧图根哈特（Tom Tugendhat）牵头，旨在“促进辩论和新思维”。图根哈特曾严厉批评中国对新冠肺炎疫情的应对，称北京在病毒爆发早期淡化疫情。 但图根哈特表示，这个议会的“中国研究小组”不会“反华”。 他还说，该议会小组将“探索与中国接触的机会”，并研究中国的经济目标。 这位来自汤布里奇（Tonbridge）和莫灵（Malling）选区的保守党议员还表示，“冠状病毒危机突显出，我们迫切需要更好地了解中国在全球的地位，以及我们与中国的经济和外交接触。” 图根哈特谴责中共在新冠病毒爆发期间，将自身的政权安危置于人民的生死之上。 他说， “北京长期压制信息透明导致了这场危机的不断发展。中国共产党正在利用当前的紧急状况，在世界各地建构影响力。” “伪造数据” 上周五，身为英国议会下院外交事务委员会主席的图根哈特谴责中共在新冠病毒爆发期间，将自身的政权安危置于人民的生死之上。 他在BBC第四电台节目中表示：“真正让中共受到针对的，不是他们没有掌握足够的数据，而是故意伪造数据。” 尽管中国在处理新冠疫情方面得到了世界卫生组织的赞赏，但包括美国总统特朗普在内的许多人都指责中国当局操纵信息，未能就其严重性向其他国家发出充分警告。 中国驻英国使馆公使、首席馆员陈雯为中国在武汉疫情爆发之初的反应进行了辩护，她称“封城”使病毒向其他国家的传播减少了“77%”。 “中国人为此付出了高昂的代价，”她补充道。 “政治动机” 在被指传播有关病毒来源的虚假信息时，中国驻英国使馆公使陈雯表示，这种说法“可能与病毒本身一样危险，甚至更加危险”，而“团结与合作”是击败病毒的唯一途径。 她回应了对中国应对病毒爆发展开国际调查的呼吁，称这种行为是出于“政治动机”，不会对任何人“有任何好处”。 图根哈特表示，他牵头设立的这个新的小组将要审视的东西，不仅涉及这次疫情大流行，而且包括中国的长期经济和外交目标。这个议会小组还有另外8名保守党议员，包括前内阁大臣达米安•格林（Damian Green）。 英国政府在决定允许中国技术公司华为进入英国5G网络时产生了争议，该小组将关注新技术可能带来的后果，以及谁最终掌控技术平台。 该小组还将研究中国的外交政策，尤其是与世界上较贫困地区的关系。
"By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent Public services and safety will be carefully managed though data, while devices in our homes will talk to each other and the wider world as part of the ""internet-of-things"". Many of these services will be delivered over what is called 5G. It will be much more than just faster data on our phones, but potentially transformational for our lives - if you believe the hype. But there is a darker fear as well. What if it is also transformational for our security if we end up reliant on a Chinese company to deliver this future? That question risks causing a major divide in the Five Eyes - the intelligence alliance between the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The US is campaigning hard among allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from delivering 5G. ""We have serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere,"" Bill Evanina, head of America's National Counterintelligence and Security Center has said. ""Chinese company relationships with the Chinese government aren't like private sector company relationships with governments in the West."" 'Rigorous oversight' Huawei has always denied being controlled by the Chinese government, or that its work poses any risks of espionage and sabotage. Its founder repeated these assertions in a recent interview with the BBC. But Australia and New Zealand have sounded negative about Huawei's involvement in their 5G networks to varying degrees, and Canada is still deciding. All eyes are now on the UK. In a speech in Brussels on Wednesday, Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, set out the framework for considering the security of 5G based on its experience so far of working with the company. The current oversight regime was ""arguably the toughest and most rigorous"" in the world for Huawei, he said. His officials say they have found ''poor security and engineering"" by the company, but the indications are still that the UK may work with Huawei on 5G. If that is the decision then other countries - not only in the Five Eyes but also the EU and Nato - may well be tempted to follow, using the UK as a reference point because of its track record of scrutiny. There could be consequences, former officials warn. ""Worries about the security of UK networks following their exposure to Huawei may make the Five Eyes partners, and perhaps others such as France, Germany or Japan, less inclined to co-operate with the UK in the future,"" Charles Parton, a former British diplomat, argues in a new paper for the think tank Rusi. ""The maintenance of a 'Five Eyes standard' of cyber-security in telecommunications is a vital strategic and security interest, the loss of which would go far beyond a reduction in intelligence reports exchanged, and might lead to the UK being excluded from work on developing future technologies for intelligence collection."" 'Resilience is key' The UK's special relationship with Huawei came about in the early 2000s, when BT was upgrading its networks and the Chinese firm came in much cheaper than the alternatives - by hundreds of millions of pounds. BT told the government it planned to use the company unless the government was willing to compensate it. Even though Huawei was kept out of the core of the network and sensitive systems, concerns over security and the growing use of Huawei by other companies led - a few years later - to the creation of a ""cell"" to evaluate the security of Huawei products coming into the UK. The cell's last oversight report downgraded the assurance about mitigating the risks associated with Huawei, because of serious problems with security and engineering processes. However, Mr Martin said in his speech, the report said that these were not indicators of hostile activity by China, . The company says it will invest money to deal with these concerns in the coming years, although UK officials say that so far they have not seen ""a credible plan"". Despite that, the indications are that the UK wants to hold out against US pressure and continue to work with the company on 5G. A decision is expected in the next two months by ministers who will need to balance security with costs and the risks to wider relationships. ""Resilience is key,"" Mr Martin said in Brussels. ""There must be sustainable diversity in the supplier market."" That was one signal that even though the UK may work with Huawei, it is cautious about ending up with one dominant player on whom it is dependent. But critics fear that Huawei - possibly with Chinese state backing - is working its way into a dominant position in the long term, particularly by penetrating markets in the developing world and by setting standards for 5G. One of the biggest challenges with 5G is cost. Significant cost In many countries, telecoms companies paid much more for the 5G spectrum than they had expected. They are now looking at the sums and indicating their strong preference for the cheapest vendor - Huawei. Telecoms operators in the UK say the way in which 5G can work in a highly integrated system alongside 4G means that excluding Huawei is not realistic without significant cost and delay, including potentially removing existing hardware, leading to the UK falling behind. Breaking the ties with the company could also have significant consequences for the UK-China relationship which poses challenges with Brexit approaching. But the question will be how the US and the Trump administration reacts if the UK does not follow its line - especially if other countries use the UK as cover to follow and work with Huawei. This at a time when the UK may be looking for a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. It potentially leaves the UK between a rock and a hard place and is one more reason why the Huawei decision is placing strain on the historically close Five Eyes intelligence relationship.",在光明乐观的愿景中，未来我们将生活在“智能城市”：无人驾驶汽车在智能电网上充好电后，会核对最佳路线。,"公共服务和安全保障将通过数据得以细致管理，而我们家中的设备会作为物联网的一部分互相对话，与更广阔的世界交流。 许多这样的服务会通过5G传送。如果你相信宣传，这不仅意味着我们手机上的数据更快，还可能改变我们的生活。 但这也带来了担忧。如果我们未来最终依赖中国公司来传输这些数据，而这种依赖对我们的安全带来彻底改变，这将意味着什么？ 这个问题或许会给""五眼联盟""带来巨大分歧。“五眼联盟”是由美国、英国、加拿大、澳大利亚和新西兰组成的情报联盟。美国正在盟友间大力游说，希望将中国电信巨头华为排除在5G供应商之外。 “我们十分担忧华为对中国政府的义务，以及它对美国和其他地区电信网络完整性的威胁，”美国国家反情报与安全中心总监埃瓦尼纳（Bill Evanina）说。 “中国公司与中国政府之间的关系并不像西方私人企业与政府的关系。” “严格监管” 华为一直否认遭到中国政府控制，也否认其工作存在间谍和破坏活动的风险。该公司创始人最近接受BBC采访时重申了这些说法。 华为创始人任正非：“美国无法扼杀我们” 对华为参与本国5G网络，澳大利亚和新西兰在不同程度上持负面态度，加拿大仍在考虑，现在所有的目光都聚焦在英国。 英国国家网络安全中心负责人马丁（Ciaran Martin）周三（2月20日）在布鲁塞尔的一次讲话中称，根据目前与华为合作的经验，已经制定了测试5G安全性的框架。他说，对华为来说，目前的监管制度“可以说是全球‘最难最严苛的’”。 他手下的官员表示，已经发现华为“安全性和工程技术很差”，但仍有迹象表明，英国可能与华为在5G方面展开合作。 如果英国与华为开展5G合作，那么其他国家——不仅包括“五眼联盟”，还有欧盟和北约——很可能会效仿，因为英国的审查记录可以作为参照。有前官员警告，这可能带来严重后果。 英国国家网络安全中心负责人马丁 英国前外交官帕顿（Charles Parton）在一篇新论文中称：“英国若与华为合作，对英国网络安全性的担忧可能会导致‘五眼联盟’以及如法国、德国或日本等其他国家未来不太愿意与英国合作。” “维持电信网络安全的'五眼标准'是一项至关重要的战略和安全利益，失去该保障将比情报交换报告减少更严重，并可能导致英国被排除在开发未来情报收集技术的工作之外。” “适应力是关键” 英国与华为的特殊关系始于21世纪初，当时英国电信正在升级其网络，而华为的报价比其他家便宜数亿英镑。 英国电信对政府表示，他们计划跟华为合作，除非政府愿意补偿。尽管华为并未进入网络核心和敏感系统，但出于对其安全性的担忧，加上其他公司越来越多地使用华为的服务，数年后英国创建了“The Cell”来评估华为英国产品的安全性。 因为华为在安全以及工艺流程方面存在严重问题，“The Cell”最新一份监管报告调低了华为相关的风险担保级别。 不过马丁在其讲话中说，报告中的这些内容并不是中国进行敌对活动的证据。华为表示，未来几年将投资解决这些担忧。英国官员则表示，他们迄今未看到“一个可信的计划”。 尽管如此，种种迹象表明，英国希望顶住来自美国的压力，继续与华为在5G领域开展合作。预计未来两个月，部长们会做出决定。 “关键看容忍程度，”马丁在布鲁塞尔表示。 “供应商市场必须具备可持续的多样性。” 有一个信号是，尽管英国可能与华为合作，但它对自己依赖的一家主导企业持谨慎态度。批评人士担忧，华为也许有中国政府支持，长期而言会通过打入发展中国家市场和制定5G标准，逐渐占据主导地位。5G最大的挑战之一是成本。 巨大的成本 在许多国家，电信公司为5G技术支付的费用远高于预期。他们现在会研究数字，并表明他们倾向更便宜的供应商华为。 英国的电信运营商说，5G与4G在一个高度集成的系统中工作，排除华为不现实，因为这意味着巨大的金钱和时间成本，最终导致英国处于落后地位。 与该公司断绝关系还可能对中英关系产生重大影响。这会给面临脱欧的英国带来挑战。 问题是，如果英国不跟随美国，如果其他国家效仿英国与华为合作，美国和特朗普政府会如何反应。目前英国可能正寻求与美国达成脱欧后的贸易协议。 这可能会让英国进退两难，这次关于华为的决定也会给历来关系密切的“五眼联盟”带来压力。"
"By Reality Check teamBBC News The winning left-wing candidate will now earn a salary equivalent to about $5,707 (£4,310) a month and no other public official will be able to earn more than him. Mr López Obrador said the official residence, Los Pinos, will become a cultural centre. The Mexican politician is certainly not the first leader to make the statement of lowering his or her salary. It's a populist gesture often used to demonstrate that a leader of a country is in touch with the people, putting distance between themselves and the elite, says Dr Philipp Koeker at the Leibniz University, Hannover, who has studied presidential salaries in Europe. Reality Check has looked at some of the countries where this has happened before. Allowances and expenses mean there can be differences between the official salary and what the prime minister or president actually earns so it's not always easy to know the total income. But there are still significant gaps in the basic salaries of leaders around the world. The Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is said to be the highest earner - paid more than $2m (£1.5m) a year. That amount is tied to the highest salaries in the country's private sector. British Prime Minister Theresa May earns about £150,000 a year, less than German Chancellor Angela Merkel who earns closer to £200,000 whereas Chinese President Xi Jinping is said to earn just $22,000 (£16,600) a year. Who else has taken a pay cut? Uruguay's Jose Mujica in power until 2015, labelled the world's poorest president, gave away 90% of his monthly salary, which was about £7,500. Although many leaders have forgone part of their earnings, they've still enjoyed the exclusive perks of the job. However, Mr Mujica drove an old Volkswagen Beetle and chose to live in a farmhouse instead of the presidential residence. Also in the region, Evo Morales the president of Bolivia, reduced his salary to about £1,000 a month when he took power in 2005. He was fulfilling an election campaign promise. In Bolivia, no public sector employee is allowed to earn more than the president, which meant at the time there were pay reviews across the government. In 2015, the then president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, under fire for the country's widespread economic challenges, ordered mass cuts to government jobs and a 10% reduction to her own salary to about $90,000 (£68,000) a year. A 10% cut to the salaries of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his staff was announced in 2015 amid rising food prices and Western sanctions. Mr Putin declared an income of 18.73m roubles (£226,444) in 2017. More than half of this amount came from the sale of a property in the Moscow area. South Africa's new president Cyril Ramaphosa said he intends to cut his salary in half, which means about £100,000 will be distributed through the Nelson Mandela Foundation. A former businessman and one of South Africa's richest men Mr Ramaphosa reportedly has a fortune of more than $400m. The presidential salary in Nigeria was $70,000 (£53,000) before Muhammadu Buhari and his vice president agreed to a 50% pay cut at the beginning of his term in 2015. Going back further, in the 1980s the former president of Burkina Faso Thomas Sankara took a monthly wage of $450 and banned the use of chauffeur-driven cars and first class airline tickets by his ministers, according to the Guardian. Who doesn't take a salary? The current Slovakian president, Andrej Kiska, who entered politics a rich man, donates his entire salary to a charity. In 2013, the Slovakian president had received a monthly salary of more than $9,000 (£6,800). It was the highest in central and eastern Europe at the time, according to an analysis by Dr Koeker. Donald Trump has followed in the footsteps of other US presidents by donating most of his salary to charity and only taking $1 a year. Herbert Hoover and John F Kennedy made the same symbolic gesture. American presidents earn about $400,000 (£320,000) a year. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer told journalists at a news conference in March 2017 that Mr Trump wanted the help of the media to decide where the salary should be donated.

"Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohamed were led away from court after the verdict. Australian Peter Greste was deported back to Australia earlier this year and was on trial again in absentia. The three are accused of aiding the banned Muslim Brotherhood group but they strenuously deny the allegations. The three journalists were originally sentenced in July 2014, with Mr Greste and Mr Fahmy receiving seven years and Mr Mohamed getting 10 years. But their convictions were overturned in January this year and they were freed in February to await retrial. Giving the verdict on Saturday, judge Hassan Farid said the three men were not registered journalists and had been operating from a Cairo hotel without a licence. He handed three-year sentences to Mr Greste and Mr Fahmy but gave Mr Mohamed an additional six months. Reaction: Peter Greste speaks to the BBC It is unclear how long Mr Fahmy and Mr Mohamed will now serve. They were in prison for about a year before being freed. Lawyers for the three journalists are expected to appeal against the decision. The BBC's Lyse Doucet, who was in the court, said the verdict came as a shock to a room packed full of Egyptian and foreign journalists. The expectation was that the journalists would be found guilty, she adds, but that they would be given a lesser sentence and be allowed to walk free. 'Dangerous message' Mr Greste said in a tweet that he was ""shocked"" and ""outraged"" while Al-Jazeera said the verdict was ""yet another deliberate attack on press freedom"". Outside the courtroom, Mr Fahmy's lawyer, Amal Clooney, called on Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi to issue a pardon to the journalists. ""The verdict today sends a very dangerous message in Egypt,"" she told reporters. ""It sends a message that journalists can be locked up for simply doing their job, for telling the truth and reporting the news."" She said she would push for her client, who has given up his Egyptian citizenship, to be deported to Canada.",以“散播虚假消息”罪名被埃及法庭定罪的三名半岛电视台记者被判处三年有期徒刑。,穆罕默德和法赫米 在重审宣判之后，加拿大-埃及双重国籍的穆罕穆德·法赫米，以及埃及籍的巴希尔·穆罕默德两人被带离法院。 澳大利亚籍的彼得·格雷斯特今年早些时候被驱逐出境，已经返回澳大利亚，埃及法庭是在他不在场的情况下对他作出宣判。 宣判法官表示，他们三人在埃及并没有登记作为记者的身份，而且在没有执照许可的情况下从开罗一家酒店里进行工作。 格雷斯特今年早些时候已经被释放 在宣判消息公布之后，美国对此表示“极度失望”，国务院发言人说判决“危害言论自由”。 英国、加拿大、澳大利亚和联合国也表达关切，半岛电视台表示判决违反逻辑和常识。 他们三人被控协助被禁的穆斯林兄弟会，但他们三人否认有关指控。 原本他们三人在2014年7月被判刑，格雷斯特和法赫米两人被判7年徒刑，穆罕默德被判10年徒刑。 但今年1月法庭推翻他们的罪名，后来他们获释等待重审。 （编译：友义，责编：立行）
"Jeremy Hunt told the BBC he was keeping his options open over how the UK could respond, and refused to rule out sanctions. A group of activists occupied Hong Kong's parliament on Monday over a controversial extradition bill. China warned the UK not to ""interfere in its domestic affairs"". Mr Hunt said he would not discuss any potential consequences ""because you don't want to provoke the very situation you are trying to avoid"". ""Of course you keep your options open,"" he added, insisting the UK would not just ""gulp and move on"" if China cracks down on protesters in the former British colony. Mr Hunt said he ""condemned all violence"" but warned the Chinese government not to respond to the protests ""by repression"". Hong Kong was a British colony for more than 150 years, but it was returned to China in 1997 after a treaty was signed by the two countries. The 1984 treaty guaranteed a level of economic autonomy and personal freedoms not permitted on the mainland. Demonstrators argue that a piece of legislation introduced by the city's pro-Beijing leader would make it easier to transfer people to face trial in China. Mr Hunt reiterated that China must honour Hong Kong's high level of autonomy from Beijing. ""The heart of people's concerns has been that very precious thing that Hong Kong has had, which is an independent judicial system,"" Mr Hunt told Radio 4's Today programme. ""The United Kingdom views this situation very, very seriously,"" he added. China's ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office on Wednesday following ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" remarks. Liu Xiaoming said relations between China and the UK had been ""damaged"" by comments by Mr Hunt and others backing the demonstrators' actions. He said those who illegally occupied the Legislative Council building and raised the colonial-era British flag should be ""condemned as law breakers"". He added that it was ""hypocritical"" of UK politicians to criticise the lack of democracy and civil rights in Hong Kong when, under British rule, there had been no elections nor right to protest. Analysis: Will the war of words endanger relations? By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Britain's relations with China are at a low ebb. The question now is whether the damage is lasting. China appears determined to use the Hong Kong protests as an opportunity to push back against what it sees as Britain's illegitimate interference in its former colony. But equally Britain seems determined not to be bullied by China. Mr Hunt says the UK has every right to defend a treaty it signed with China in 1984 guaranteeing Hong Kong's freedoms and relative autonomy. The foreign secretary had no option but to summon the Chinese ambassador to London for a diplomatic dressing down. The danger is that this war of words infects the wider relationship and endangers Britain's strategic trading interest with China, something that will only become more important after Brexit. So Mr Hunt threatens ""serious consequences"" if China fails to honour the so-called Joint Declaration treaty. But he remains tight-lipped about what that might mean, not just because the UK has few diplomatic or economic cards it might wish to play, but also because he does not want to provoke a subsequent clash that might damage Sino-British relations even further. In response to accusations he had sided with the protesters, Mr Hunt said: ""I was not supporting the violence, what I was saying is the way to deal with that violence is not by repression."" ""It is by understanding the root causes of the concerns of the demonstrators - that freedoms that they have had for their whole life could be about to be undermined by this new extradition law,"" he added. Victor Gao, vice-president of the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing, called Monday's occupation of parliament ""anarchism"", adding ""this is to be protested and to be condemned by any government leader with any level of conscience"". Mr Gao urged the UK to condemn the violence. He said the ""crux of the matter"" was ""the UK no longer has a say in [how] Hong Kong should be run and managed"". In 1984, the Joint Declaration, signed by Margaret Thatcher and the then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, set out how the rights of Hong Kong citizens should be protected in the territory's Basic Law under Chinese rule. Since 1997, Hong Kong has been run by China under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". Mr Hunt said: ""It is very important that the 'one country, two systems' approach is honoured."" The foreign secretary would not detail what consequences China might face if it did not honour the treaty, but said the UK had ""always defended the values we believe in"".",英国外交大臣亨特在近日谈及香港民众抗议事件时警告中国不要压制香港民主，并表示否则将有“严重后果”。此言一出立即引发连锁反应，也引起各界的好奇心。,英国外相亨特警告中国不要压制香港民主 外相亨特讲话不久，中国驻英大使刘晓明随即召集记者会指责亨特大臣干涉中国内政，是“殖民者思维”的表现。 英国外交部次长麦克唐纳也紧接着召见刘晓明讨论有关问题。 英国中国外交辩论 为何在中国警告英国干涉内政时英国外交大臣亨特再次警告中国呢？亨特大臣所说的严重后果有可能是什么？ 值得注意的是，亨特目前正在竞选英国保守党党魁一职，如果胜选将出任英国首相。 香港特区拥有自己的法律制度，集会自由和言论自由等权利均受到保护。 BBC广播4台的著名主持人米歇尔·侯赛因早间专访亨特，质询他在内政外交一揽子问题上的态度时谈到目前英中之间的唇枪舌剑。 亨特说，中国的反应并不令人意外。但中方需要理解的是，英国也必须遵守国际承诺。亨特表示，英国签署了关于香港问题的中英联合声明。声明明确写道香港制度50年不变。英方期待中方兑现这个承诺。 侯赛因指出，联合声明规定，香港主权移交中国后，即置于中国中央政府领导之下。 暴力冲击立法会事件令人担心香港法制和言论自由发展。 亨特表示，联合声明给予香港特区高度自治，香港的基本自由权利得到保障，这是主权移交的基础，这也是香港取得全球性巨大成功的基础，即将活跃的商业与对民主自由权利保障相结合的环境。 亨特表示，英国承认香港是中国的一部分。只是想说，希望英方和中方达成的协议能得到尊重保障。 英中关系受影响 侯赛因对亨特指出，中方感到愤怒的是，在有人暴力冲击香港立法会后，你谈论保护自由表态是站到了破坏法律的人一边。中国媒体也指责你为私利破坏中英关系。 亨特表示，不论是他个人还是英国政府，都谴责任何形式的暴力活动。香港支持和平示威活动的民众也对暴力冲击行为感到不安。他并没有支持暴力活动。但他希望表达的是，对待那种暴力活动不应是以暴制暴的镇压，而是理解示威者担忧的根源问题，即他们一直享有的自由可能被送中法案破坏。 关于对暴力冲击立法会的人士的处理会有什么影响，亨特表示，香港有自己的独立司法系统。作为英国外相，他不会去臆测香港司法系统会如何处理暴力冲击者。他所说的严重后果，是指中英双方都达成的国际协议遭到违反。 呼吁维护国际规则秩序 亨特表示，虽然有近日的分歧，中英关系（近年来）总体发展良好。未来也没有理由不能很好发展。但对英国来说，最重要的是一国两制的承诺必须遵守。 亨特强调，中国从以规则为基础的国际体系中获益巨大，在这个体系中达成国际协议的国家相互遵守有关协议，所以如果不遵守中英达成的有关国际协议，当然会对中国，也会对英国造成后果。 亨特表示，不能以暴制暴，需要了解港人担心的根源。 在被追问到底会有什么样的严重后果、英国政府会采取什么行动时，亨特表示，英国外交大臣不会具体说明有什么样的具体措施，这就是美国前总统克林顿所说的战略模糊的含义。不说明具体措施，就是为了避免本希望避免的事情发生。 亨特强调表示，从历史上，英国一直是世界上倡导民主、自由和公民权利国家，这个是个原则性的问题，不能做交易，所以认为目前事态很严重，令人担忧。所以，英国仅要求1984年的中英联合声明精神需要得到遵守。
"He said: ""I killed about three of them... I don't know how many bullets from my gun went inside their bodies. It happened and I cannot lie about it."" His statement came hours after his spokesman denied that Mr Duterte had personally killed anyone. The recent controversy began on Wednesday at the president's palace. He told a group of business leaders gathered there: ""In Davao I used to do it [kill] personally. Just to show to the guys [police] that if I can do it why can't you. ""And I'd go around in Davao with a motorcycle, with a big bike around, and I would just patrol the streets, looking for trouble. I was really looking for a confrontation so I could kill."" Mr Duterte was mayor of the southern city for two decades, during which time he earned a reputation for brutally suppressing crime, and was accused of sponsoring death squads. He first spoke about killing three men in 2015, while still mayor of Davao. He said that the men were suspected of kidnapping and rape. Speaking to the BBC on Friday, Mr Duterte's spokesman Martin Andanar said the president's apparent admissions were simply tough talk and that he was ""not a killer"". ""That is the style of the president, ever since he was a mayor he would talk that way,"" Mr Andanar said. ""We do not take all of those statements literally. We take it seriously, but we don't take it literally."" But hours later Mr Duterte reiterated his earlier admissions. But he denied reports that he had shot people who were kneeling down with their hands tied behind their back. 'Not an addict' Speaking to the BBC after a news conference, Mr Duterte pledged to wage his war on drug dealers ""until the last day of my term"". Nearly 6,000 people are said to have been killed by police, vigilantes and mercenaries in the Philippines since Mr Duterte launched a drug war after being elected in May. Critics say he has encouraged police and vigilantes to shoot drug dealers and users on sight. Mr Duterte denied that he was a drug addict himself, despite using the powerful pain killer Fentanyl. ""I'm not an addict,"" he said. ""Only when it is prescribed. Addiction is only with regularity, my friend."" Mr Duterte has admitted to using the drug, saying he had migraines and issues with his spine. Mr Andanar dismissed claims that the president was suffering from the side effects of Fentanyl, which can cause confusion, anxiety and even hallucinations. ""[Mr Duterte] is healthy,"" Mr Andanar said. ""We've seen him work till the wee hours of the morning. He is in a hurry, [and is] very impatient because our country has been dragged down to the toilet."" The president's admission on Wednesday sparked calls for his impeachment from opposition leaders and rights groups. It was the latest in a series of controversial claims by Mr Duterte since he became president. Senator Leila de Lima, a staunch critic of Mr Duterte, has said his admission could be grounds for impeachment.",菲律宾总统杜特尔特向BBC证实，他担任达沃市市长期间曾亲手杀死三名嫌犯。,"杜特尔特说，他将继续进行反毒品战争，直到任期结束。 他说：""我杀了大约三个……我不知道我枪里射出的子弹有多少射入了他们的身体。这确实发生了，我不能撒谎。"" 仅仅几个小时前，菲律宾总统府发言人刚刚公开否认杜特尔特曾亲手杀过人。 这起""杀人""风波是本周三（12月14日）开始的。 当时，杜特尔特在总统府与一群商界领袖谈话时说：""在达沃，我曾经亲自动手（杀人）。我就是要让他们（警察）看看，我能这么做，你们为什么不能。 ""我就骑着摩托车，一个大摩托，在达沃转悠，在街上巡逻，找茬。我真的是在寻衅滋事，找机会杀人。"" 杜特尔特曾在菲律宾南部的达沃市担任市长长达20年之久。在任期间，他以严酷打击犯罪闻名，据称还曾暗中组织暗杀团杀死涉嫌犯罪的人员。 2015年，杜特尔特还在达沃市长任内时就说过，他曾亲手杀死三个人。他说这三个人涉嫌绑架和强奸。 ""不能字面理解"" 杜特尔特在总统府承认亲手开枪杀人之后，菲律宾反对党领袖和人权组织都呼吁对他进行弹劾。 星期五（12月16日），杜特尔特的发言人马丁·安达纳尔对BBC记者说，杜特尔特总统只是在说硬话，他其实不会杀人。 安达纳尔说：""那是总统的风格，从他当市长时他就这样说话……我们不能把他所有的话都完全从字面上去理解。"" 但是，几个小时之后，杜特尔特就再次重复了他曾亲手杀人的说法。但他否认曾像有些报道所说的，他曾打死双手反绑，跪在地上的人。 在周五的一场记者招待会后，杜特尔特对BBC记者说，他将继续进行反毒品战争，""直到我任期的最后一天""。 自从杜特尔特今年5月就任总统以来，据信已有近6千人在所谓反毒战争中被杀死。"
"I am Chelsea Manning, Pte First Class Manning said in a statement to NBC's Today programme. ""I am a female."" The 25-year-old said he had felt female since childhood, wanted at once to begin hormone therapy, and wished to be addressed as Chelsea. Pte Manning faces 35 years in prison for crimes including espionage. The soldier could be released on parole after at least seven years in jail, his civilian lawyer David Coombs has said. Mr Coombs has asked President Barack Obama to pardon Pte Manning, and has pledged to appeal against the verdict and sentence. Pte Manning will serve the sentence at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and on Thursday, Mr Coombs indicated the soldier was willing to take legal action to force the prison to provide hormone therapy if authorities refused. He said Pte Manning had not indicated whether he wanted to undergo sex reassignment surgery. ""The ultimate goal is to be comfortable in her skin and to be the person that she's never had an opportunity to be,"" he said. Asked why Pte Manning was making this announcement now, the day after sentencing, Mr Coombs said: ""Chelsea didn't want to have this be something that overshadowed the case."" Pte Manning's struggles with gender identity formed a key part of the defence through the weeks-long court martial. Defence witnesses, including therapists who had treated Pte Manning, testified that the soldier had spoken of wanting to transition to being a woman, suggesting that these problems had affected his mental health. Wig and lipstick Pte Manning's former Army supervisor testified that the accused had sent him a photograph of himself wearing a blond wig and lipstick. US military prosecutors, meanwhile, described Pte Manning as a notoriety-seeking traitor and asked for a 60-year sentence in order to deter future intelligence leakers. Pte Manning, who grew up in the US state of Oklahoma and in Wales, joined the Army in 2007 to help pay for university and, according to court martial defence testimony, to shake off a desire to become a woman. The soldier trained as an intelligence analyst and was deployed to Iraq in 2009. There, Pte Manning became disillusioned with the war and felt increasingly isolated from friends and family. In May of that year, Pte Manning initiated what subsequently became one of the largest leaks of classified US government documents ever - hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and battlefield reports from Afghanistan and Iraq.",向维基解密泄密的美军士兵布拉德利·曼宁（Bradley Manning）8月22日发表声明称不愿再当男儿，希望成为一名女性，。,曼宁的律师向法庭呈交的这张2010年的照片上，戴假发，涂口红的“女子”是男扮女装的曼宁。 在一份发给美国全国广播公司（NBC）的 《今日》节目（Today programme）的声明中，曼宁声称“我是女性”，“我叫切尔西·曼宁（Chelsea Manning）。” 他请求立刻获准开始为变性接受荷尔蒙疗程，并请求外界从此用切尔西这个名字相称。 曼宁说自己从孩提时代就觉得自己应该是女性。 美国一个军事法庭周三（21日）判处曼宁监禁35年，至少服刑七年后方可假释。 上诉 他的律师库姆斯已经请求奥巴马总统赦免曼宁，并誓言将对判决提出上诉。库姆斯不是军方律师。 曼宁将在堪萨斯州的利文沃斯堡监狱服刑。 库姆斯周四表示，如果监狱方面不允许曼宁接受变性疗程，他将采取法律手段。 他承认曼宁未曾提及是否要做变性手术。 在被问及为何在法庭判决后次日发表这份声明，库姆斯答曰“切尔西不希望这件事为庭审蒙上阴影”。 25岁的曼宁被控把70万份机密军事和外交文件，以及美军在战场射杀平民的录像泄露给维基解密网。 军事法庭裁决曼宁犯有多项间谍和盗窃罪，但通敌罪指控不成立。通敌罪至多可判终身监禁。 性别困惑和挣扎构成曼宁案的辩护关键。 包括曾为曼宁提供治疗的专业人士作为辩方证人出庭时证实，他确曾表露希望自己是女性，并表示对自己性别的纠结对曼宁的心理和精神健康有影响。 曼宁在美国俄克拉何马州和英国威尔士长大，2009年参军。在接受情报分析训练后，曼宁2010年被派驻伊拉克。 他原来的一名上级军官在军事法庭作证时说，曼宁曾把自己一张戴假发涂口红的男扮女装照片发给他。 （编译：郱书 / 责编：顾垠）
"Of that total, 21% was made up of fruit and vegetables and 41% of bakery items. Using its own data and industry-wide figures, it also estimated that across the UK food industry as a whole, 68% of salad to be sold in bags was wasted - 35% of it thrown out by customers. The retailer is introducing measures to reduce wastage including developing promotions for smaller bags of salad. The latest figures published by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) suggested 15 million tonnes of food went to waste in the UK in 2010. Figures for 2012 will be published next month. Publishing its food waste figures for the first time, Tesco said that, in the first six months of this year, its stores and distribution centres generated 28,500 tonnes of food waste. The largest proportion of that - about 11,700 tonnes - was classified as ""bakery"", and the second largest category, making up around a fifth of the total, was fruit and vegetables. Dairy products and convenience foods such as ready meals each made up 8% of the waste, impulse buys such as confectionery and soft drinks accounted for 6%, and meat, fish and poultry for 5%. The remainder of the waste was split between other categories such as alcohol, cereals and frozen food. Tesco said that, where possible, if food could not be sold it was either donated to poverty charity FareShare, converted into animal feed for livestock, or was recycled into renewable fuel. Prime Minister David Cameron recently praised the FareShare charity and, on Monday, his spokesman told a regular Westminster briefing: ""There will be widespread concern about levels of food that go to waste and that's why the prime minister has noted the excellent work that FareShare does."" Tesco has also given wastage estimates for the 25 best-selling products across the UK food industry as a whole. The figures were based on waste data from Tesco supermarkets, distribution centres, suppliers and producers - combined with Wrap figures on levels of waste in UK homes. It estimated that 24% of grapes were wasted between the vine and the fruit bowl and that a fifth of all bananas were unused - with one-in-10 thrown away by customers. It also suggested some 40% of apples and 47% of bakery items in the UK were wasted. 'No quick fix' Tesco said it addressing the problem of waste by ending multi-buys on large bags of salad, removing ""display until"" dates from fresh fruit and vegetables, using smaller cases in stores, and rearranging 600 in-store bakeries to reduce the amount of bread on display. And it said it was involved in trials with apple growers to reduce pests and disease. Other measures to tackle the problem would include providing simple tips to customers about storing fruit, Tesco said. It said it would also share tips about how to use leftover bread, adding it was working with grape and banana suppliers to improve delivery times and conditions. Matt Simister, Tesco's commercial director of group food, said there was ""no quick-fix single solution"" to tackling food waste. ""Families are wasting an estimated £700 a year and we want to help them keep that money in their pockets, rather than throwing it in the bin,"" he said. ""We're playing our part too and making changes to our processes and in store. ""Ending multi-buy promotions on large packs of bagged salads is one way we can help, but this is just the start and we'll be reviewing what else we can do."" He said Tesco was working with its suppliers to try to cut waste at all stages of the journey from farm to fork. Richard Swannell, director of Wrap, said: ""We welcome Tesco's approach to tackling food waste across their whole supply chain, and by identifying the hot spots they can tackle these areas effectively. ""Food waste is a global issue and collaborative action is essential if we are to successfully reduce food waste and reap the financial and environmental benefits of doing so."" Investigative food journalist Joanna Blythman, meanwhile, said consumers were being ""ripped off"" by supermarket promotions - especially those involving fresh food. ""What we could say to consumers is 'wise up',"" she told the BBC News Channel. ""The minute you walk into the supermarket you may be able to get a few bargains but, more likely than not, you'll be nudged into buying stuff you didn't really want or need and it will go in the bin.""",英国主要连锁超市之一的特易购（Tesco）公布的数据显示，今年上半年它经销的食物中有近3万吨被扔进垃圾桶。,特易购数据显示食物浪费惊人 因为过期而被超市本身和顾客扔掉的食物中包括68%的袋装蔬菜沙拉、近50%的面包糕点，还有40%的苹果。 这是特易购首次公布食物供应链中的浪费数据。 它同时宣布了一系列旨在减少浪费的措施，包括新鲜蔬菜沙拉用小袋包装并取消“买一送一”。 特易购跟踪调查了25种销量最大的食品从入库到端上餐桌整个过程中的“脚印”，并把结果与非政府组织“浪费和资源行动计划”（Wrap）的数据综合分析，得出各类食品的浪费情况。 浪费食物 数据显示，今年前6个月，28500吨食品在特易购的批发中心、超市和顾客家里被扔掉。 例如葡萄，从葡萄园到消费者的水果盘这个过程中，约四分之一进了垃圾桶。与此同时，五分之一的香蕉被扔掉。 特易购指出，每10根浪费的香蕉中有一根是顾客扔的。 虽然解决食品浪费问题没有速效良方，但特易购还是提出了一系列减少浪费的办法。 对付办法 消费者将会发现，特易购超市的大袋蔬菜沙拉和“买一送一”之类减价促销标签都不见了。包装出售的新鲜蔬果都改用小袋、小盒盛放。货架上的面包糕点数量明显减少。 该超市还准备与果农和消费者合作，共同设法延长水果的保鲜时间，减少腐烂，从而减少浪费。 顾客还将看到有关如何保存蔬果的小贴士，以及如何利用未变质的剩余面包的资料等。 Wrap组织对特易购的行动表示欢迎，并指出食物浪费是个全球性的问题，需要各方共同努力才可能减少浪费。 据统计，英国家庭每年因扔掉食品造成的经济损失相当于700英镑。 Wrap上一次在2011年公布的数据显示，英国每年浪费食物估计达1500万吨。 （编译：郱书 责编：顾垠）
"By Padraig BeltonTechnology of Business reporter ""Winter is coming,"" laughs Lin Liu, a 29-year-old Shanghai tech worker. Electric vehicles, industrial robots, and microchip production all slowed recently. Big firms like Alibaba, Tencent, and search engine Baidu have slashed jobs. Overall, one in five Chinese tech companies plans to cut recruitment, says jobs site Liepin.com. ""And I think this slowing down will continue,"" says Ms Liu, who's run a tech start-up and the Slush start-up conferences in Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Nanjing. The US-China trade war is partly why - both nations imposed tariffs on each other's goods in 2018. But China's economy, which has enjoyed double-digit growth in six of the last 15 years, will slow to 6.3% growth in 2019, predicts the International Monetary Fund. This is still double the world's average, but China's slowest growth since 1990. And China's start-up scene, boasting a third of the world's ""unicorns"" - start-ups worth more than $1bn (£769m) - is plotting a ""strategic restructuring"" as the economy and tech sector cool, Ms Liu says. ""What drove things completely insane was too much money,"" argues William Bao Bean, managing director of Chinaccelerator, a Shanghai-based start-up accelerator. There was a ""real push for economic growth from the government"" and big funding from state coffers, he says. This has levelled off. ""Before, you could get $3m with two people knocking and a smile. Now you can get $3m with two people knocking and a smile and six weeks of meetings,"" he says. Dockless bike sharing rivals Mobike and Ofo were pedalling off with investors' money last year in a bitter duel for market share. That sector's now hit the brakes. ""You definitely have a lot more people walking around those bikes than riding those bikes,"" says Gregory Prudhommeaux, who has worked with Shanghai start-ups since moving from France in 2005. Ofo owes one billion yuan ($148m; £114m) in unpaid debts. In December, a Beijing court placed it and chief executive Dai Wei on a blacklist after Ofo defaulted on suppliers' payments. And Mobike lost 4.6 billion yuan in 2018 and won't make a profit until 2021, says China Tonghai Securities, a Hong Kong broker. It quietly doubled its Beijing fees last month, with one yuan now buying you a 15-minute ride instead of half an hour. China's 6,200 online peer-to-peer lending platforms, like Weida and Yirendai, were a thriving bubble two years ago. But 80% have closed or hit major difficulties since, says the Yingcan Group, a Shanghai consultancy. Amid a government crackdown, this number might dip below 300 by the year's end. Belt tightening has been one result, as companies shed ""the coffee machine in the office and the subsidised taxi ride home after 9pm"", says Michael Norris, a Shanghai-based Australian who researches China's tech scene. ""The bar and restaurant scene is slowing down, people are eating out less on expenses,"" agrees Mr Prudhommeaux. Tech companies are also pushing employees harder, resulting in rising complaints about the common ""996"" working week - 9am to 9 pm, six days a week. For companies, ""the feeling at the top end of town is that the easy growth is gone,"" says Mr Norris. One reason is that China's market is more saturated. While only 56% of the population is on the internet, Tencent, Shenzhen's internet giant that last year became Asia's first $500bn-plus company, says this percentage includes most of the people who buy online. More Technology of Business ""When you account for those who are too young or old to own a smartphone, and people who have a little bit of money, we're basically at saturation,"" Mr Norris says. So it's pricier to get customers. This means start-ups are having to link up with China's online giants. ""The cost of user acquisition is really high; start-ups cannot afford it any more,"" complains Ms Liu. It could cost 300 yuan to acquire a new user, but that user may only ever spend 200 yuan, she says. In the last year or so, ""over half the unicorns"" aligned with either Tencent or Alibaba, making ""a bifurcation of the market into clans"", says Mr Bean. For start-ups wanting to train artificial intelligence models on big amounts of data, linking with Tencent, Alibaba, or Baidu creates huge advantages. China has ""a huge amount of data already"", says Shenzhen resident Yang Yang, founder of Unimaker, a 3D printing start-up. And big data helps Chinese start-ups localise and improve to beat overseas companies trying for a foothold. This is how Meituan-Dianping, a Beijing group-buying site, beat off rivals Groupon, Didi Chuxing, Uber, and iQiyi, says Mr Yang. Also, start-ups are selling more to businesses instead of consumers. One or two years ago, ""you'd see virtual reality start-ups targeting customers, like in the gaming industry"", says Ms Liu. ""Now they're targeting businesses, like real estate and medical companies."" But there are advantages to China's tech bubble deflating. For investors, things are ""actually much better in a downturn than a hot period, so good companies have a chance to shine,"" says Mr Bean. When everybody can get money, ""it makes it difficult for the best to stand out"", he says. And increasing protests at the ""996"" working week give start-ups a chance to offer something different. If you ""don't want to be following 996 at big companies, maybe come work for my company,"" says Mr Prudhommeaux. The slowdown may also force companies to focus more, believes Mr Norris. Chinese tech and internet firms are ""rather infamous"" for rambling across very different lines of business, he says. Meituan, for example, is an online food platform that also acquired a bike share scheme. But these non-core businesses drag down the companies' margins, argues Mr Norris. ""There's going to be a refocus on good, competent strategy - the art of choosing what not to do,"" he predicts. So China's sunny gold rush days may be ending, but the coming winter may deliver a cold blast of efficiency that many tech firms need. Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebook",中国一度热得烫手的科技产业正在降温。,科技创业者刘林认为，科技企业的“冬天来了”。 “冬天要来了，”29岁的上海科技产品业者刘林（音）笑说。 电能车、工业机器人和微晶片的生产，在近期全都慢下来了。 像阿里巴巴、腾讯这样的大公司，以及百度这样的搜索引擎公司，都对内裁减了职位。 根据求职网站猎聘网说，每五家中国科技公司当中就有一家有计划裁员。 “而且我觉得这种增长放缓还会继续，”刘林说。他曾经经营过一家初创科技公司，还在上海、深圳和南京举办过Slush创业投资大会。 随着市场饱和，中国的经济增长正在放缓。 中美贸易战是其中一个原因——两国在2018年都向对方的商品加征关税。 不过，据国际货币基金组织（IMF）预计，在过去15年中的六年都有两位数增长的中国经济，在2019年的增幅将下降到6.3%。 这个数字仍然是全世界平均增幅的两倍，但却是中国自1990年以来最慢的增长。 而刘林说，中国号称占世界三分之一的“独角兽公司”——指估值达10亿美元（7.69亿英镑）以上的初创企业——在经济和科技产业都在降温的情势下，正在筹备一场“策略性的重组”。 “令一切完全疯掉的因素是钱太多，”上海一家初创企业加速器中国加速（Chinaccelerator）的董事总经理宾威廉（William Bao Bean）说。 中国加速的宾威廉表示，科技产业过去就是“钱太多”。 他表示，为了推动经济增长，有大量的资金推力来自政府部门和国库。 这种推力现在已经放缓了。 宾威廉说：“过去，你可能是两个人碰一下，谈笑间就得到300万（投资）。现在你要得到300万，可能是两个碰一下，笑一下，再开六个星期的会。” 共享单车的竞争对手摩拜（Mobike）和Ofo小黄车为了争夺市场份额，去年就在一场残酷的对决中烧光了投资人的钱。 这一块市场现在就踩了刹车。 “现在见到这些单车绕开走的人肯定比骑这些车的人要多得多，”格莱戈里·普鲁德霍默（Gregory Prudhommeaux）说。他在2005年从法国搬到中国，与多家上海初创企业有过合作。 摩拜单车在去年亏损了数亿元。 Ofo小黄车欠下了10亿人民币（1.48亿美元；1.14亿英镑）的未偿还债务。 12月，在它未能支付供应商钱款之后，北京一所法院将这家公司及其首席执行官戴威列入了黑名单。 2018年，摩拜单车则损失了46亿人民币，而香港券商中国通海证券（China Tonghai Securities）指，摩拜在2021年之前都不会盈利。 上月，摩拜在北京地区悄悄地将租车金融提高了一倍，现在你付一元租车的时间从过去的半小时变成了15分钟。 两年前，像宜人贷、微贷网这样的P2P网络借贷平台在中国有6200个，是一个膨胀中的泡沫。 不过据上海盈灿咨询公司统计，这些平台在之后有80%已经关闭或者面临重大困难。 在政府的打击下，这类平台到今年末可能会下降到300个以下。 中国初创企业普鲁德霍默表示，科技公司正在重新考虑自己的支出成本。 这样做的其中一个结果就是大家都开始勒紧裤头。在上海研究中国科技行业的澳大利亚人迈克尔·诺里斯（Michael Norris）说，一些公司可能开始撤掉办公室里的咖啡机，以及不再允许员工在9点后打车回家。 普鲁德霍默也说：“酒吧和餐厅的生意也开始沉下来，人们在外面吃饭花的钱变少了。” 科技公司对员工的要求也更苛刻了，于是就有了对越来越普遍的“996工作制”的抱怨——很多科技公司员工的工作时间经常是上午9点到晚上9点，一周工作六天，成为常态。 诺里斯表示，对于企业来说，“站在顶端轻易得到增长的那种优势感已经消失了”。 其中一个原因，中国市场饱和程度在加大。 这里的上网人群只占总人口的56%，而去年成为亚洲第一家5000亿美元公司的互联网巨头腾讯称，这个比例包括了大部分有网购行为的人口。 “当你的目标针对那些年纪太小或太大以至于玩不上智能手机，同时手上又有点钱的人时，我们基本上就是处在一个饱和的市场，”诺里斯说。 于是要找到客户，成本又变得更高。 这就意味着，初创企业不得不与中国的互联网巨头合作。 刘林抱怨说：“收集用户资源的成本真的很高；初创企业已经再负担不起这个了。” 他说，要取得一个新客户，成本可能是300元人民币，但是那个用户会花的钱可能只有200元。 宾威廉说，在过去一年左右，“超过一半的独角兽公司”都和腾讯或者阿里巴巴搭上了线，将一个“市场分支变成了大山头”。 对于想要通过大数据来培养人工智能的初创企业来说，与腾讯、阿里巴巴或者百度联盟会制造巨大优势。 UniMaker创始人杨漾说，初创企业需要通过互联网巨头来获得大数据。 住在深圳的3D打印初创企业UniMaker的创始人杨漾表示，中国“已经有一个庞大的数据”。 大数据帮助中国初创企业完成本土化和提升自己，从而打败试图插一脚的外国公司。 杨漾说，北京的美团点评公司就是这样打败Groupon、滴滴出行、优步和爱奇艺这些竞争对手的。 而且，初创企业卖给公司的业务比卖给客人的更多。 刘林说，一两年前，“你会看到虚拟现实的初创公司以客人为目标，就像博彩行业一样。” “现在，它们的目标是公司，像地产和医药公司。” 勒紧裤头反而会对中国初创企业有利？ 不过，中国科技泡沫萎缩也有它的好处。 宾威廉表示，对于投资者来说，“经济下行其实比火热时期更好，因为好的公司有机会发光”。 他说，当人人都有钱的时候，“最好的公司脱颖而出就会很难”。 而对“996”工作模式越来越多的反抗也给了初创企业以契机，去提供不一样的东西。 普鲁德霍默说，如果你不想在大公司走“996”，“要不就来我的公司吧”。 诺里斯相信，经济放缓可能还会迫使企业更专注。他说，中国科技和互联网公司出了名的喜欢在跨界行业里跳来跳去。 比如美团，就是一个网上饮食平台，但又收购了共享单车业务，还有一个低价酒店连锁品牌。 但是，诺里斯认为，这种缺乏核心业务的状态令公司的收益受损。 他预测：“行业将会重新聚焦到良好的竞争策略上来——选择不做什么，是一种艺术。” 所以，中国的淘金热或许正在过去，但是即将到来的冬天却可能给很多科技公司带来一个它们所需要的冷静期。
"The final column of about 100 armoured vehicles carrying 500 soldiers crossed the southern Iraqi desert overnight. At the peak of the operation there were 170,000 US troops and more than 500 bases in Iraq. Nearly 4,500 US soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqis have died since the US-led campaign began in 2003. The operation has cost Washington nearly $1 trillion (£643bn). US forces ended combat missions in Iraq in 2010 and had already handed over much of their security role. ""(It's) a good feeling... knowing this is going to be the last mission out of here,"" said Private First Class Martin Lamb, part of the final ""tactical road march"" out of Iraq. ""Part of history, you know - we're the last ones out."" As the last of the armoured vehicles crossed the border, a gate was closed behind them and US and Kuwaiti soldiers gathered there to shake hands and pose for pictures. The only US military presence left in Iraq now is 157 soldiers responsible for training at the US embassy, as well as a small contingent of marines protecting the diplomatic mission. The low-key US exit was in stark contact to the blaze of aerial bombardment Washington unleashed against Saddam Hussein in 2003. Tribute US President Barack Obama marked the end of the war earlier in the week, meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. He announced in October that all US troops would leave Iraq by the end of 2011, a date previously agreed by former President George W Bush in 2008. In a recent speech at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, President Obama paid tribute to the soldiers who had served in Iraq. He acknowledged that the war had been controversial, but told returning troops they were leaving behind ""a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq"". However, correspondents say there are concerns in Washington that Iraq lacks robust political structures or an ability to defend its borders. There are also fears that Iraq could be plunged back into sectarian bloodletting, or be unduly influenced by Iran. Washington had wanted to keep a small training and counter-terrorism presence in Iraq, but US officials were unable to strike a deal with Baghdad on legal issues including immunity for troops.",在发动了导致萨达姆·侯赛因被推翻的入侵战争近九年之后，最后一批美军撤离伊拉克。,在近九年的战争之后，最后一批美军撤离伊拉克。 最后一批载有大约500名士兵的百余辆装甲车于夜间从伊拉克南部的沙漠地带撤离，进入科威特。 在最高峰时期，美军在伊拉克的500多个军事基地共驻有17万士兵。 自从以美军为首的多国入侵伊拉克战争于2003年开始以来，一共有近4500名美军士兵和数以万计的伊拉克人丧生。 整个行动使美国耗资近一万亿美元。 现在仍在伊拉克的美军人员仅剩下留在美国大使馆内负责培训任务的157人和少量的担负外交人员保卫工作的海军陆战队士兵。 美国总统奥巴马10月份宣布美军将于2011年底之前全部撤离伊拉克，这一日期是在前总统布什执政时制定的。 奥巴马在最近的一次讲话中承认伊战是一场有争议的战争，但他同时表示，撤离伊拉克的美军在身后留下了一个“稳定的、独立自主的主权国家”。
"The news has prompted headlines around the world, and Politicians and city leaders have taken to Twitter to congratulate him, including the left-leaning mayors of New York and Paris. Congratulations also came from Ahok Basuki Purnama, the governor of Jakarta. He became Jakarta's first Christian governor in 50 years when he was elected in 2014. Jemima Goldsmith, the sister of Conservative party rival Zac Goldsmith, congratulated Mr Khan on his victory. The ex-wife of Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan also appeared to criticise her brother's campaign. 'Role model' for millions The New York Times describes Mr Khan's victory as ""striking"" and leads with the fact that he is London's first Muslim mayor. It described London as a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network. A commentary in German news magazine Der Spiegel describes Mr Khan's win as a ""victory over Islamophobia"", and says London is breaking new ground. ""The mayoral election shows that London is more liberal, clever and tolerant than the Conservative mudslingers would like to think,"" it says. Qatari daily Al-Sharq says: ""Once again, the British capital enters history, this time through the gate of democratic victory by electing a Muslim of immigrant descent as its mayor."" Pakistan's Dawn newspaper says that Khan should see himself as a role model for millions of Muslims living in Europe. With the rise of increasingly popular right-wing parties across the continent, the paper's Brussels correspondent Shada Islam writes that ""Khan's story should help set the record straight on immigration, integration and European Muslims"". History Professor Juan Cole points out that Mr Khan is by no means the first Muslim in charge of a European city. In a popular blog post he traces the history of Muslim rule in Spain, Greece, the Balkans, and Sicily. ""Not to mention that Constantinople/Istanbul is one of the larger European cities... the mayor there is a Muslim,"" he says. Bus drivers 'new elite'? Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, former co-chair of the UK Conservative Party, and Business Secretary Sajid Javid congratulated Mr Khan and pointed out their similar backgrounds. ""Bus drivers are clearly the new Etonians"" quipped writer and conservative activist Tim Montgomerie, referring to the elite public school attended by Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Goldsmith. In France's Le Figaro, London-based French essayist Laetitia Strauch-Bonnart says ""two images of the United Kingdom"" faced each other in this election: The ""exemplary success story"" of Mr Khan's life and ""the billionaire's son"", Mr Goldsmith. ""In order to appeal nowadays, it is better to have a disadvantaged background, a personal history made of difficulties and social mobility,"" she told the paper. ""It's the spirit of the time, and Goldsmith was not on the right side."" Finally, before the result was in, former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted a warning about how Mr Khan could possibly be treated if Republican hopeful Donald Trump was to become US President.",英国工党候选人萨迪克·汗（Sadiq Khan）当选国际大都市伦敦新市长。,英国工党候选人萨迪克·汗（Sadiq Khan）当选伦敦新市长。 萨迪克·汗1970年10月8日出生于一个平民家庭，父母是巴基斯坦裔移民，父亲是一名公交车司机。萨迪克在家里8个孩子中排行第5。 他儿时住在伦敦南部的一个政府廉租房屋里，上的是当地普通的公立中小学。 他在北伦敦大学里学习法律，毕业后成为一名人权律师，代理的著名案件包括起诉伦敦警方种族歧视案，反对英国政府禁止一名国际著名穆斯林组织领导人入境案等。 萨迪克·汗从政后加入英国工党，于2005年在伦敦南部图庭（Tooting）区胜选，当选英国下议院议员，并担任当时英国下议院议长杰克·斯图尔（Jack Straw）的议会事务私人秘书。 2008年，萨迪克·汗加入工党内阁，在布朗政府中曾分别担任负责社区、地方政府和交通事务国务大臣，后升任交通部大臣。工党成为反对党后，萨迪克·汗曾分别担任过影子内阁司法大臣和影子内阁财政大臣，也担任过影阁伦敦事务部长。 萨迪克·汗在竞选中表示，将重点解决伦敦目前住房、交通、公共设施的系列问题，承诺一旦当选将在今后4年里冻结每年不断上涨的伦敦公交和地铁票价，还将招聘更多黑人和少数族裔加入警察部门。 在2016年5月的伦敦市长选举中，萨迪克·汗击败其它4党的候选人，当选第3位通过选举胜出的伦敦市长。 他也是伦敦有史以来第一位当选的穆斯林市长。 萨迪克·汗已婚，有两个孩子。 （编译：立行/责编：董乐）
"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It is 6.1mm (0.24in) thick, and also gains a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. It has an anti-reflective coating on the screen for the first time, and the A8X - a faster version of the processor featured in the firm's latest iPhones. However, some analysts have questioned whether the upgrade will be enough to turn around iPad sales. An upgraded version of the firm's smaller tablet - called the iPad Mini 3 - was also announced. Like its bigger sibling, it gets the company's fingerprint recognition component. But it uses the older A7 processor and has a lower-resolution rear camera. Some of the details were published by Apple, reportedly by mistake, on Wednesday. Apple's last earnings release revealed that it had sold 13.3 million iPads in the April-to-June quarter. That marked a 9% fall on its tally for the same period in 2013, despite the fact the company saw sales of iPhones and Mac computers rise. It also contrasted with an 11% rise in the number of tablet shipments across the market as a whole - with Lenovo and Asus making some of the biggest gains - according to data from IDC. The market research firm said that the iPad remained the bestselling tablet brand, but that its market share had dropped over the year from 33% to 26.9%. Cannibalised sales? One expert suggested that the recent launch of the 5.5in (14cm)-screened iPhone 6 Plus, which shares most of the new iPads' features, could further temper demand. ""Given that Apple's launched larger iPhones, it needs to find a market that the iPad Mini fits into,"" said Jitesh Ubrani from IDC. ""It was a response to the market as a whole moving to smaller tablets. And now that phablets are growing in not just screen size but also in market size, unless Apple carves out a special place for it, we expect sales of the Mini in particular to be cannibalised quite a bit."" Apple's chief executive Tim Cook has told investors he still believes that the tablet market will eventually surpass that of PCs, and has pointed to a recent deal with IBM - involving the two firms co-developing business-centric apps - as a way to get iPad sales on ""a faster trajectory"". Mr Ubrani agreed that targeting businesses had huge potential, but warned that sales to consumers would remain a challenge. ""People who have the old iPad 2 or more recent versions are still happy with these devices - they are still functioning perfectly fine,"" he said. ""There's really no reason to upgrade."" Other new features of the iPad Air 2 include an eight megapixel rear camera that can now capture slow-mo videos at 120 frames per second. The front camera has also been upgraded to allow in more light and take a rapid succession of selfies. In addition, the machine includes a new type of wi-fi chip that supports faster data speeds, including downloads at up to 866 megabits per second (Mbps). ""It is disappointing - particularly to enterprise buyers - that there wasn't a 12.9in [32.8cm] iPad model,"" said JP Gownder from research firm Forrester, who otherwise praised the update. ""In order to return iPad to high growth, form factor innovation will be required."" The new tablets will become available to buy next week at similar prices to before. New iMacs Apple also introduced a new model of its all-in-one iMac computer featuring what it said was the highest resolution display on the market. The computer has a 27in (68.6cm) screen that has a resolution of 5K - 5210 by 2880 pixels - offering about five times the detail of a ""full HD"" 1080p television. That represents four times the number of pixels found in the standard iMac of the same size. The basic model will cost $2,499 (£1,555) and is already available for sale. Lenovo already sells the N308 - an all-in-one Android-powered desktop PC with a 19.5in (49.5cm) screen offering slightly lower 4K resolution, while Panasonic has the Toughpad MB5025 - a 20in (50.8cm) 4K computer that runs Windows 8. Intel and Samsung have also announced plans to manufacture 4K screens for other all-in-one PCs. Otherwise, large ultra-high definition display are still a rarity in the computing sector beyond the use of separate monitors, which may aid demand for the new computer. ""There is a huge difference in quality once you start moving through the different sets of screens,"" remarked Ranjit Atwal, research director at the tech consultancy Gartner. ""Given the amount of consumption people are doing of online video, and the quality of what they can get from services like YouTube and Netflix on 4K TVs, they want to see that replicated on a PC as well."" Apple suggested that people doing visual productivity tasks, such as photo editing, would also benefit from the innovation. Apple also announced an upgraded version of its screenless computer, the Mac Mini, but there was no mention of an update to its Apple TV set top box, which last received a hardware refresh in March 2012. The company also said that the latest version of its operating system for Mac computers - OS X Yosemite - was being made available for download this Thursday.

"The China-based executive, Xinjiang Jin, is accused of helping to terminate at least four video meetings in May and June, hosted by people based in the US. A warrant is out for his arrest. Zoom said it was co-operating with authorities. China has not commented on the case. The California-based company said it had ""terminated"" the employee for violating its policies, and had ""placed other employees on administrative leave pending the completion"" of an internal investigation. The pro-democracy protests and their suppression are strictly taboo in China. What are the allegations? A statement from the US Department of Justice said Xinjiang Jin, also known as Julien Jin, had been charged with ""conspiracy to commit interstate harassment and unlawful conspiracy to transfer a means of identification"". Prosecutors say that from January 2019 he conspired to ""censor the political and religious speech of individuals located in the United States and around the world at the direction and under the control of officials"" in the Chinese government. Among the actions taken on behalf of China's government, prosecutors allege that the 39-year-old and others terminated at least four meetings commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, some of which were attended by dissidents who had participated in and survived the protests. They allege that he fabricated violations of Zoom's terms of service to justify his actions to his superiors. ""Jin willingly committed crimes, and sought to mislead others at the company, to help [Chinese] authorities censor and punish US users' core political speech merely for exercising their rights to free expression,"" acting US Attorney Seth DuCharme in Brooklyn said in a statement. According to the statement, the Chinese authorities ""took advantage of information provided by Jin to retaliate against and intimidate participants"" residing in China or family members of participants based in the country. The statement does not mention Zoom by name, but the company confirmed that its former employee had been charged. ""We learned during the course of our investigation that the China-based former employee charged today violated Zoom's policies by, among other things, attempting to circumvent certain internal access controls,"" it said. It added that the employee ""took actions resulting in the termination of several meetings in remembrance of Tiananmen Square and meetings involving religious and/or political activities"" and ""also shared or directed the sharing of a limited amount of individual user data with Chinese authorities"". Mr Jin is living in China and is not in US custody. He faces up to 10 years in prison. What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989? Pro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square in April 1989 and began the largest political demonstrations in communist China's history. They lasted six weeks, with as many as a million people taking part. On the night of 3 June tanks moved in and troops opened fire, killing and injuring many unarmed people in and around Tiananmen Square. Afterwards the authorities claimed no-one had been shot dead in the square itself. Estimates of those killed in the crackdown range from a few hundred to several thousand. China has never given an official figure for how many people died.",美国司法部对一名前Zoom公司的员工提出起诉，罪名是协助中国政府破坏一系列和六四周年有关的视频会议。,美国司法部指控Xinjiang Jin （又名Julien Jin，指控未提及中文名）在今年5月至6月期间至少四次阻断身在美国的人参加的会议。Jin曾是Zoom在中国的一名员工。 美国司法部已经发出逮捕令。 Zoom表示将配合政府行动。中国方面尚未对此事作出评论。 Zoom公司说，已经和这名员工解除雇佣合同，同时对其他员工开展了内部调查。 在中国，民主抗议和政府镇压是言论的禁区。 创始人袁征坦承今年以来Zoom的使用者一夜之间暴增。 具体指控 美国司法部的声明称，Jin被指控的罪名包括，合谋跨州骚扰罪和非法合谋转移身份识别信息罪。 司法部称，Jin从2019年开始就对身在美国和世界各地的个人政治宗教言论进行审查，他处于中国政府官员控制之下。这名39岁的男子至少阻断了四次和六四事件31周年有关的会议，这些会议的参与人包括当年的参与者和幸存者。 “Jin故意犯罪，而且寻求误导公司其他员工，帮助中国当局审查和处罚美国用户的政治言论，以及他们的言论自由权利，”美国纽约东区联邦代理检察官塞思·杜查姆（Seth DuCharme）在声明中说。 美国司法部称，Jin从2019年开始就对身在美国和世界各地的个人政治宗教言论进行审查，他处于中国政府官员控制之下。（图文无关） 这份声明称，中国当局利用从Jin手上获取的信息，对来自中国的参会者以及一些参会者在中国的家人进行报复和恐吓。 声明并未明确提及Zoom，但该公司确认有一名前员工遭到指控。 “在我们进行调查的过程中得知，一名在中国的员工今天遭到指控，他违反的公司政策包括，试图绕开公司内部的权限控制。” Zoom还表示，这名员工阻断了几次和纪念天安门广场事件有关的政治或宗教类的会议。此外他还向中国当局提供了一些个人用户信息。 Jin目前生活在中国，并未遭到美国政府逮捕。但他的罪名一旦成立，将可能面临最高10年的刑期。 香港政府31年來首度禁止香港紀念六四集會
"The Culture Secretary told the Sunday Telegraph that voters had legitimate fears over ""excessive"" immigration. Mr Javid, elected Conservative MP for Bromsgrove in 2010, criticised migrants who had lived in Britain for many years but still could not speak the language. He also said there was no place for Sharia law in the English legal system. 'Laws and culture' Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, said: ""People want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right. ""People also say, when immigrants do come to Britain, that they should come to work, and make a contribution and that they should also respect our way of life, and I agree with all of that. It means things like trying to learn English."" He added: ""I know people myself, I have met people who have been in Britain for over 50 years and they still can't speak English. ""I think it's perfectly reasonable for British people to say 'look, if you're going to settle in Britain and make it your home you should learn the language of the country and you should respect its laws and its culture'."" Mr Javid spoke amid reports that Sharia courts have been established in cities such as London, Birmingham, Bradford and Manchester. He said: ""Where people want to have their own private arrangements between them, that is a matter for them. But there is no place for Sharia law in British law."" Mr Javid also expressed concern about allegations of a plot by Muslim radicals to ""Islamise"" state schools in Birmingham. He went on to say that the ""vast majority"" of immigrants wanted to integrate with the rest of society in the UK. 'Not new' Mr Javid is the first Asian male in the cabinet, after Baroness Warsi became the first Muslim female in her role as co-chairman of the Conservative Party. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Javid's comments did not represent anything new. Mr Vaz told BBC Radio 5 live: ""It was a Labour government that introduced an English language test for those who wanted to get indefinite leave to enter the country. ""This is not new; it's just interesting because it's been said by the first Asian cabinet minister. Politicians have been saying this of all parties. ""Of course we want people to learn English, of course we want people who come into this country to respect our values. We're not suggesting otherwise."" Mr Javid's interview came a day after the Daily Mail reported that immigrants who could not speak English had been able to buy documents saying they had passed a language test.",英国第一个少数族裔内阁大臣，文化大臣贾维德（Sajid Javid）说，移民必须学英语，并“尊重我们的生活方式”。,贾维德是第一位进入政府内阁的亚裔男性。 在接受《星期日电讯报》采访时贾维德说，对“过量的”移民，选民感到恐慌是正当的反应。 贾维德2010年当选保守党议员。 他对那些在英国生活多年仍不会说英语的移民提出了批评。 他同时说，在英国的法律体系内，绝对没有伊斯兰法的空间。 文化与法律 贾维德是巴基斯坦移民后裔，他说，他认识某些人，在英国生活了50年了，仍不能讲英语。 有报道说，在英国的部分城市，如伦敦、伯明翰、布拉德福德和曼彻斯特，已经出现了一些伊斯兰法庭。 贾维德表示，如果人们愿意私下里解决他们的纠纷，那是他们的事，但英国法律体系内没有伊斯兰法的位置。 他补充说，“绝大多数”移民是愿意融入英国社会的。 贾维德是第一位进入政府内阁的亚裔男性。 （编译：白墨 责编：尚清）

"By Tim HarfordBBC World Service, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy My left-hand little finger holds the shift key, then the other fingers of my left hand clumsily crab sideways across the upper row. Q-W-E-R-T-Y. There's a lesson here: it matters where the keys sit on your keyboard. There are good arrangements and bad ones. Many people think that qwerty is a bad one - in fact, that it was deliberately designed to be slow and awkward. Could that be true? And why do economists, of all people, argue about this? It turns out that the stakes are higher than they might first appear. Find out more: 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources and listen to all the episodes online or subscribe to the programme podcast. But let's start by figuring out why anyone might have been perverse enough to want to slow down typists. In the early 1980s, I persuaded my mother Deb to let me use her mechanical typewriter, a miraculous contraption which would transcend my awful handwriting. When I hit a key, a lever would flick up from behind the keyboard and whack hard against an inked ribbon, squeezing that ink against a sheet of paper. On the end of the lever - called a type bar - would be a pair of reversed letters in relief. I discovered that if I hit several keys at once, the type bars all flew up at the same time into the same spot. Fun for a nine-year-old boy, less so for a professional typist. Typing at 60 words per minute (wpm) - no stretch for a good typist - means five or six letters striking the same spot each second. At such a speed, the typist might need to be slowed down for the sake of the typewriter. That is what qwerty supposedly did. Then again, if qwerty really was designed to be slow, how come the most popular pair of letters in English, T-H, are adjacent and right under the index fingers? The plot thickens. The father of the qwerty keyboard was Christopher Latham Sholes, a printer from Wisconsin who sold his first typewriter in 1868 to Porter's Telegraph College, Chicago. That bit's important. The qwerty layout was designed for the convenience of telegraph operators transcribing Morse code - that's why, for example, the Z is next to the S and the E, because Z and SE are indistinguishable in American Morse code. The telegraph receiver would hover over those letters, waiting for context to make everything clear. So the qwerty keyboard wasn't designed to be slow. But it wasn't designed for the convenience of you and me, either. So why do we still use it? The simple answer is that qwerty won a battle for dominance in the 1880s. Sholes' design was taken up by the gunsmiths E Remington and Sons. They finalised the layout and put it on the market for $125 - perhaps $3,000 (£2,271) in today's money, many months' income for the secretaries who would have used it. It wasn't the only typewriter around - Sholes has been described as the ""52nd man to invent the typewriter"" - but the qwerty keyboard emerged victorious. The Remington company cannily provided qwerty typing courses, and when it merged with four major rivals in 1893, they all adopted what became known as ""the universal layout"". And this brief struggle for market dominance in 1880s America determines the keyboard layout on today's iPads. Nobody then was thinking about our interests - but their actions control ours. And that's a shame, because more logical layouts exist: notably the Dvorak, designed by August Dvorak and patented in 1932. It favours the dominant hand (left and right-hand layouts are available) and puts the most-used keys together. The US Navy conducted a study in the 1940s demonstrating that the Dvorak was vastly superior: training typists to use the Dvorak layout would pay for itself many times over. So why didn't we all switch to Dvorak? The problem lay in co-ordinating the switch. Qwerty had been the universal layout since before Dvorak was born. Most typists trained on it. Any employer investing in a costly typewriter would naturally choose the layout that most typists could use, especially when economies of scale made it the cheapest model on the market. Dvorak keyboards never stood a chance. So now we start to see why this case matters. Many economists argue qwerty is the quintessential example of something they call ""lock in"". This isn't really about typewriters. It's about Microsoft Office and Windows, Amazon's control of the online retail link between online buyers and sellers, and Facebook's dominance of social media. More things that made the modern economy: How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff What leaded petrol says about the limits of regulation? How the plough changed everything How Ikea's Billy bookcase took over the world If all your friends are on Facebook apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp, doesn't that lock you in as surely as a qwerty typist? This matters. The lock-in is the friend of monopolists, the enemy of competition, and may require a robust response from regulators. But maybe dominant standards are dominant not because of lock-in, but just because the alternatives simply aren't as compelling as we imagine. Consider the famous Navy study that demonstrated the superiority of the Dvorak keyboard. Two economists, Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis, unearthed that study, and concluded it was badly flawed. They also raised an eyebrow at the name of the man who supervised it - the Navy's leading time-and-motion expert, one Lieutenant-Commander… August Dvorak. Liebowitz and Margolis don't deny that the Dvorak design may be better: the world's fastest alphanumeric typists do use Dvorak's layout. In 2008, Barbara Bradford was recorded maintaining a speed of 150 words per minute (wpm) for 50 minutes, and reached a top speed of 212 wpm using such a keyboard. But they were just not convinced that this was ever an example where an entire society was desperate to switch to a hugely superior standard yet unable to co-ordinate. And in fact these days, most of us peck away at our own emails, on devices which can actually let you switch your keyboard layout. Windows, iOS and Android all offer Dvorak layouts. You no longer need to persuade your co-workers, other employers and secretarial schools to switch with you. If you want it, you can just use it. Nobody else is even going to notice. Yet most of us stick with qwerty. The door is no longer locked, but we can't be bothered to escape. Lock-in seems to be entrenching the position of some of the most powerful and valuable companies in the world today - including Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. Maybe those locks are as unbreakable as the qwerty standard once seemed. Or maybe they risk being crow-barred off if restless consumers are tempted by something better. After all, it wasn't that long ago that people worried about users being locked in to MySpace.

"BTCC said it would stop buying and selling on 30 September in response to tightening regulation. It comes after authorities banned initial coin offerings on 5 September. The country has seen an explosion of digital currency trading, sparking fears about the financial risks and speculative investing. The price of Bitcoin tumbled sharply following the BTCC announcement late on Thursday but has since regained some ground. Cracking down Chinese authorities expressed concern over the investment risks involved in crypto-currencies and ordered a ban on initial coin offerings, or ICOs, earlier this month. A growing number of tech companies are opting to sell digital ""tokens"" to raise funds because they are quick, easy and unregulated. Then on Wednesday this week, the state-backed National Internet Finance Association issued a warning that virtual currencies are increasingly being used as a tool for illegal fundraising and money laundering. BTCC, one of the world's biggest Bitcoin platforms, said in a tweet Thursday after ""carefully considering"" the directive from regulators, trading on its platform would cease and it would stop registering new users from Thursday. BTCC also runs an international exchange from Hong Kong. More intervention is expected. The BTCC shutdown comes ahead of speculation that the Chinese government plans to completely ban exchanges. Reuters and other media have reported this week, citing sources, that China is planning the suspension, but the regulator has not yet made any such announcement. China's ICO ban, and wider fears of more regulation, has prompted a sell-off that has wiped billions of the value of crypto-currencies since they hit record highs at the start of the month. Currency risk Regulators around the world are in the midst of working out how to address some of the risks around virtual currencies. The UK's financial watchdog warned this week that ICOs are ""very high-risk, speculative investments,"" while the US Securities and Exchange Commission said in July that some ICOs should be regulated like other stocks. Regulators in Singapore, Hong Kong and Canada have also pointed out some of the dangers. Digital currencies are also facing scrutiny from the private sector. This week JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon branded Bitcoin a ""fraud"" and said it was set to ""blow up"". Mr Dimon told an investor conference in New York that if any of his traders were found trading Bitcoin he would ""fire them in a second"", and that Bitcoin was ""worse than tulips bulbs"", referring to a famous market bubble from the 1600s.",在虚拟货币比特币（Bitcoin）的交易报价近日大幅反弹之后，中国国内一些知名交易平台公布不再提供支付服务和禁售。,比特币交易报价最近大幅反弹 中国著名比特币交易平台“比特时代”周三（8日）公布，即日关闭第三方支付接口。此前一天，中国最大销售网站淘宝旺宣布，将从1月14日起禁售比特币等一系列虚拟货币、比特币矿机及挖矿教程等商品。 淘宝在公告中声明，商家应遵守当局《关于防范比特币风险的通知》等规定，又指出“央行明确要求第三方支付机构关闭比特币、莱特币等交易通道”。 淘宝的母公司阿里巴巴正寻求在晚些时间上市。淘宝现在的举动被认为是配合中国政府对虚拟货币的政策之外，也配合阿里巴巴在上市前加紧清理平台上销售的伪冒商品，方便阿里巴巴顺利上市。 擦边球方式 比特币第三方支付早在2013年12月份就已经被叫停。此外，中国中央银行又规定，在今年春节前，比特币第三方支付应当结算完毕并不能开展新的业务。 多个比特币交易平台随即陆续关闭第三方支付服务并纷纷转成人工转账充值。 对于第三方支付被叫停，中国最大的比特币交易平台比特币中国推出“BTCC码”，以擦边球方式继续进行网上充值。做法是买家在淘宝网上购买这种“BTCC码”，再去比特币中国平台上完成充值，就可以得到相应的金额，购买比特币。 不过，随着淘宝网禁售比特币和相关产品，“BTCC码”的命运将成疑问。 （撰稿：田耕 责编：顾垠）
"A report by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Aviation said efforts should be made ""to ensure the UK retains and grows hub capacity"" at Heathrow or a new purpose-built hub airport. It comes as the government rejected calls for a third runway at Heathrow. Chancellor George Osborne said the government understood there was a need for additional airport capacity. On Tuesday, Transport Secretary Justine Greening said the government remained opposed to a third runway at Heathrow, despite calls from Conservative MPs for a change of heart. The coalition agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats rules out any expansion of Heathrow before the next election, while Labour also currently opposes the idea of a third runway at the UK's largest airport. 'Trading nation' But a consultation on future air capacity in south-east England has twice been delayed amid reported divisions within the coalition and Conservative ranks. The chancellor said more airport capacity was needed in the south east but exactly where ""is not a decision you can make right here, right now"". ""Over the next few months we will be talking to people about where that capacity should be,"" Mr Osborne said. ""I am very clear; we are an open trading nation and just as we don't want to shut down our ports or our railways, we don't want to shut down our airpsace."" The All Party Aviation Group, which brings together MPs from across the parties with an interest in aviation but has no formal parliamentary role, said the UK was being left behind on aviation capacity. It has taken evidence from 60 organisations and its chair, Labour MP Brian Donohoe said the findings ""advocate a new direction for UK aviation"". He said: ""In order to achieve the greatest possible economic and social contribution from aviation, we need two things from government: a forward-looking aviation policy that allows for aviation growth; and a new approach to the taxation of aviation. ""Combined, a new approach could not only energise the sector but also provide a firm foundation for the UK's economic recovery. ""In common with all other sectors, aviation must continue to address its carbon emissions and environmental impacts. It has already achieved significant improvements but can and must do more."" The group, which received advice and administrative assistance from the Fair Tax on Flying campaign - an alliance of more than 30 travel organisations who think tax on air passengers is too high - said Airport Passenger Duty is ""a barrier to inward business"". The government should undertake an economic analysis of the impact of the tax ""on growth and employment,"" the MPs said.

"Imports also fell for the month by 16.1% in yuan terms, compared with forecasts for a fall of about 12%. That means the country's trade surplus has risen to 210.2 billion yuan (£21bn; $32.4bn) from 18.6bn yuan in March. Recent economic data from the mainland has shown further signs that China's slowdown is continuing. ""[The surplus rise] was mainly due to further import weakness,"" said Moody's analyst Alistair Chan in a note. ""Imports have slowed on account of the housing slump and reduced demand for commodities, while exports have been softened on account of the uneven global recovery,"" he said. Economist Tony Nash of Delta Economics said there was clearly pressure on China's trade environment. ""But the environment is improving and will continue through the second quarter,"" he said. ""We see some difficulties in the third quarter, with recovery late in the year."" In US dollar terms, China's exports for the month fell 6.4%, while imports fell 16.2%, and the trade surplus rose to $34.13bn. Some official numbers from the mainland are now reported by media in both currencies, because of currency conversion factors based on US dollar and Chinese yuan movements over the last year. China's economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, its weakest for almost 25 years.",中国海关总署10日公布中国6月份出口同比增7.2%，增幅大于5月的7%，但不如市场预期的10%；进口增长5.5%，稍高于市场预期的5.4%，5月萎缩1.6%。,中国海关总署公布中国6月份出口同比增7.2% 同时，中国6月的贸易顺差从5月的359.2亿美元缩小到316亿美元，不如市场预期的369.5亿美元。 中国海关总署发言人郑跃声在北京表示，中国完成全年7.5%外贸增长目标仍是很艰巨的任务，预计下半年中国外贸增长将显着高于上半年，但仍面临诸多不利条件。 分析认为中国外贸增长要达至全年7.5%目标存在困难。 据海关统计，2014年上半年，中国进出口总值12.4万亿元人民币，比去年同期下降0.9%，其中出口6.5万亿元，下降1.2%；进口5.9万亿元，下降0.6%；贸易顺差6306.1亿元，收窄6.5%。 按美元计价上半年进出口，出口和进口值分别同比增长1.2%、0.9%和1.5%。 对今年下半年中国外贸进出口形势判断，中国海关预计今年下半年进出口增速将显着高于上半年；但看到中国外贸仍然面临着严峻、复杂的形势，要完成全年7.5%的预期增长目标，任务十分艰巨。 分析认为中国全年外贸增长达7.5%目标存在困难 至于人民币汇率相对疲软导致外贸表现回暖的问题，发言人郑跃声指出，中国稳步推进汇率市场化改革，有序扩大人民币汇率的浮动区间，增强人民币汇率双向浮动的弹性，特别是人民币汇率单边升值的预期已被打破，出口企业汇率压力也得到了一定的释放。 他建议中国的出口企业应当积极运用汇率的避险工具，降低汇率波动风险，提升中国外贸出口的竞争力。 目前正值中美战略与经济对话进行中，美国财长继续在人民币问题上向中国施压，美国要求中国进一步让人民币升值。 中国财政部长楼继伟在经济对话上指出，美国量化宽松政策有序退出是好事，但对发展中国家存在波动性影响，给中国在内的一些国家在汇率管理上带来一些困难。 楼继伟回应美方提出疑问，指中国在汇率政策是否不需要政府干预。但中国认为，在经济没有完全复苏，资本跨境流动还不是很正常的情况下，难以做到政府示不干预。 分析料增长平稳 中国银行国际金融研究所高级研究员周景彤向BBC中文网表示，剔除去年6月份基数是负的因素，今年6月份中国贸易整体表现算是正常；进口方面，主要与国内稳增长、支持实体经济建设、投资等这方面的需求增加有关系。 他预料，今年下半年进出口可保持平稳增长。根据现在国际及国内形势，6%至7%的出口增速应该说是正常，符合预期。不过实现全年7.5%的外贸增长目标还是有一定的困难。 另外，中国国际经济交流中心研究员王军也认为6月份的贸易数据显示，中国的内需虽有回升，但结合物价指数来看，需求还是偏弱，完成全年的外贸目标难度也比较大。 （责编：萧尔）
"By John SudworthBBC News, Shanghai And in the early part of this year, much of the gossip among the shop owners and stall holders centred on the goings on, and the money to be made, not far away on the other side of the dirty old Huangpu River, at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. ""I hadn't done any stock market investments before,"" Lin Jinxia tells me, ""but I was influenced by all the talk."" Ms Lin lives at the top of seven flights of stairs, the landings of which are littered with dusty old bicycles, in a tiny apartment with her husband and her four-year-old son. They're migrant workers who arrived from Fujian Province five years ago and, through hard graft in their shop selling buttons to a bustling garment industry, they've saved themselves a tidy fortune. Then in May this year they ploughed a large chunk of it into the stock market, investing more than 200,000 RMB ($32,000: £20,000) into four separate stocks. It seemed a sensible enough spread with picks from the electronics, fashion and car-sales industries. But the timing was terrible. They all tanked, collectively standing now at just half of their original purchase price, amounting to a combined loss for Ms Lin and her husband of 100,000 RMB. ""I've lost so much of the money that I've worked so hard for,"" she says. ""Now I'm having to save and cut down on my spending. We don't earn much, it was all money from our hard work."" In China, unlike in the European or US markets, individuals make up around 80% of the investors. Many of them are new and inexperienced, often following whim and rumour to make decisions and so the market is arguably more vulnerable to quick turnarounds in herd behaviour. Having been marching share prices up the hill for well over a year, on 12 June the crowd suddenly veered back down again and three weeks later almost a third of the value - $3.2 trillion - had been wiped away in three short weeks. 'I knew there were risks' Chen Zhihui's small tailors shop can be found - although not that easily - down a passageway close to Lin Jinxia's home. And like his neighbour, he too acted on the advice of all those who had, until recently, been making nice fat paper profits, not realising he was entering the fray at the worst possible moment. ""To me, personally, I knew there were risks,"" he tells me from his tiny workspace with his sewing machine whirring away beside us. He bought just one company, 10,000 RMB's worth of a Chinese steel-maker, only to find his shares suddenly trading at around half their original value. And while his losses are relatively small, Mr Chen is well aware that in almost every other shop and home in this district and beyond, there are others in a similar predicament, or fearing that they soon might be. ""If everyone lost 5,000 RMB it could add up to a big amount,"" he says. For many analysts that explains why the Chinese government has been so keen to stop the market sliding any further. Economic impact Once it saw a buoyant stock market as a key part of its strategic shift to a consumer society with rapidly increasing share ownership having the twin benefits of both recapitalising the country's big debt-laden firms and, at the same time, making the small punter feel richer. Now the Communist party faces the frightening prospect of the very opposite effect; as savings vanish into thin air, millions of investors are simultaneously tightening their belts with potentially chilling impacts for the Chinese economy and beyond. For now, it is only the late arrivals to China's stock market binge that have been burned, with the recent, sharp depreciation in value still comfortably outweighed by longer term gains going back a year and more. But the slew of measures the authorities have unleashed in the past few days are part of an attempt - perhaps futile - to stop things getting any worse. It has been criticised by outside observers, of course, as dangerous political meddling in the workings of the markets and their ability to put a proper price on risk. But then, it could be argued, that exact same charge could be levelled at the attempts to pump up the markets in the first place. Politics not economics Some analysts dismiss the fear that a full blown stock market collapse could precipitate a wider economic shock. ""The stock market is too small, too tiny, completely irrelevant,"" Chen Long, China economist at Gavekal Dragonomics tells me. ""It accounts for just 5% of Chinese household wealth and anyway the market is still up on where it was last year."" Much more could yet be wiped off the value of Chinese shares, it would follow, before anyone needs to panic, least of all the government. So perhaps, if this view is correct, Beijing's actions are motivated by the need to contain the political fallout, rather than the economic. In the middle of an already tricky slowdown in GDP growth the last thing it needs is hordes of mom and pop stock traders taking to the streets. And so far, at least, that part of the strategy might be working with little sign of any anger. Despite her already heavy losses, Lin Jinxia's plan is to hang onto her massively devalued stock in the hope it rises again. ""I believe the government will come up with the right strategies,"" she tells me. Confident investor Liu Changrong is a restaurateur, selling noodles, pork chops and sticky rice a block or so's walk from Mr Chen the tailor. He is either canny or lucky, or both. ""You just need to buy at the right point,"" he tells me. He did exactly that, buying 200,000 RMB worth of shares in a large Chinese conglomerate last year and then selling them all in May, just below their peak. He made a very nice profit indeed, coming out more than 50%. You might think that would be a good place to call it a day. But despite the cautionary tales of his neighbours all around him he's still confident the government will turn things around. ""When the market improves, I'll get back in again,"" he tells me as he puts a big pan of water on to boil.",有着狭窄巷弄、窄小的单间屋，路边摊食物气味扑鼻的上海老城区，在新经济发展的洪流之中渐渐流失，但留存下来的，已足矣维持旧日小区生气勃勃的氛围。,林锦霞和丈夫的投资亏损了一半。 今年上半年，在店主和摊主之间流传的谣言集中谈论污浊黄河另一侧的上海证券交易所内，有赚钱的好机会。 “我以前从来没有投资过股市，但我被这些讨论给影响” ，林锦霞说。 林女士住在和丈夫及四岁的儿子住在七层公寓的顶楼，楼下停满积了灰尘的老旧自行车。 他们是五年前从自福建省来的民工，透过在店里努力将钮扣卖给光鲜亮丽的服装业者，他们终于存到一笔小钱。 而就在今年五月，他们在股市内投下了一大笔钱，投资超过20万人民币（约3万2千美元，2万英镑）买了4只股票。 他们的投资看起来已经够分散风险，选择投资在电子、时尚、汽车销售产业，但他们选了一个糟糕的时机进场。 中小型投资者占了中国股市很大一部分。 他们的股票市值重挫，来到他们原购买价的一半。林女士和丈夫损失共计10万人民币。 “我们损失了长久以来努力工作赚来的钱，我们现在只好缩减日常开销，我们赚得不多，这都是我们的血汗钱”，林女士说。 不同于欧洲或美国市场，在中国，超过80%的投资者人是个体户。 许多个体户投资人是没经验的新手，他们的决策常是跟着谣言或幻想，所以整个市场可以说是在群众行为之下更脆弱更易变动的。 中国股市在攀上高峰长达一年以上之后，在今年6月12日，群众突然改变方向，3.2兆美元，几乎三分之一的市值在短短三周内蒸发。 “我知道股市有危机” 陈智慧的小裁缝店不容易被找到，就在靠近林锦霞的人行道附近。 而就和他的邻居一样，他也过于积极的听从曾大发利市的人的建议投入股市，但他没意识到他在一个最糟糕的时间点进场。 “就我个人而言呢，我知道是有风险在的”，他在狭小的工作坊里边操作纺织机边接受采访。 他只投资了一支钢铁制造商的股票，花了1万人民币。后来发现他的股票价值比他当初买时下跌了一半。 陈智慧说他知道很多邻居都和他一样在股市中赔了钱。 他的损失还算是相对小的。陈先生知道几乎在这区附近的店铺或家庭，几乎都在股市中赔了钱，或恐怕很快就要赔钱。 “如果每个人都损失5千人民币，加起来会是一大笔钱”，他说。 许多分析师解释为何中国政府要积极阻止股市继续下挫。 经济影响 一旦中国政府将活跃的股票市场视为策略性转移至消费社会的关键，快速增加的股民对于负债累累的大公司是一项利多，同时也让小股民们觉得自己赚钱了。 目前中国共产党面临到与计画中相反的可怕前景，随着投资人的钱在股市中蒸发，投资人勒紧裤带减少支出，将可能使中国经济冷却。 现在中国股市终于面临迟来的退烧，最近大幅贬值的价格依然能稍为令人宽慰的，与长达一年以上的获利相抵消。 然而近日当局释出的转换措施只是停止情势更加恶化的一部分尝试，或无用的尝试。 男子躺卧在写着国家主席习近平喊出的”中国梦”的广告牌下，牌上写着”实现伟大复兴，就是中华民族近代以来最伟大的梦想”。 当然这被许多观察家批评是一项对股市而言危险的政治干预。 但值得争论的是，如果策略奏效股市回升，政府投入的开支也会减少一些。 是政治而非经济 有些分析师忽略了一项要素，那就是对于一个成熟的股市崩溃可能引发的更广泛的经济冲击的忧虑。 “中国股市太小，太互不相干” ，龙洲经讯（Gavekal Dragonomics）中国经济学家陈龙接受访问时表示。”中国股市只占中国家庭开支的5%，而且和去年相比，市场还是上升的”。 中国股票的价值至少在政府开始表现惊慌之前，都还不算完全被抹杀。所以如果这个观点是对的，北京方面将会依照政治需要而行动，而不是经济方面。 当前缓速成长的GDP已经让中国经济如履薄冰，政府最不想见到就是大叔大妈级股民因为不满亏损走上街头。目前为止，至少就这一点来看，政府的策略在平抑民怨上还是有点成效。 虽然林锦霞已承受巨大损失，她仍是计画继续持有手上已经大幅贬值的股票，期望股市回温。她表示，”我相信政府会实施正确的策略”。 有信心的投资人 刘长荣是一名餐厅老板，他卖面、猪排和糯米饭，他的店铺就在陈先生的裁缝店附近。 他要不是精明就是幸运，或两者皆是。”你只需要在对的时间买进”，他说。 “当股市回温，我会再进场”，刘长荣说。 他确实在正确的时间进场了。他花了20万人民币买进一个中国大集团的股票，并在五月股价快达到高峰前全数卖出。 他赚进可观的一笔钱，获利超过两倍。 尽管他的邻居们都在股灾中损失，他仍对政府稳定股市的功能深具信心。 “当股市回温，我会再进场”，他一边告诉记者，一边将大炒锅放上炉子。 （编译：刘子维，责编：萧尔）

"The women's teams of Fuzhou and Jimei universities were due to meet for a college league game in the south-eastern Fujian province at the weekend. Team members from both sides bought black hair dye to correct the problem. But one Fuzhou player's hair was deemed ""not black enough"" and the side had to forfeit for having only six players. Before the match, ""multiple players… were rejected from the match for violating a rule which requires that all players do not dye or curl their hair"", the national Global Times reports. ""Athletes are not allowed to dye their hair, grow long hair [for boys], wear weird hairstyles, or wear any accessories,"" states the rule of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, quoted by the South China Morning Post (SCMP). ""Otherwise, they will be disqualified from the competition."" The rules from the organisers, the National Youth Campus Football League (University Division), go further: ""Athletes at all stages shall not have tattoos, dye their hair, wear weird hairstyles, or wear any accessories, otherwise they will be ineligible for the competition."" The decision sparked intense debate on social network Weibo, including users expressing anger and mockery, correspondents say. There was talk about how red tape gets in the way of Chinese football players being able to perform well, and some talk about double standards, with one user saying, ""Women footballers are not allowed to dye their hair, yet male footballers can be tattooed?"" China has been increasingly stepping up regulation since mid-2018 to stop tattoos and earrings being shown on screens.

"A report by the government department which promotes UK businesses put new contracts, sales and foreign investment in the last year down to the Games. But the claims were met with scepticism by some economists and the Federation of Small Businesses. Government estimates put the cost of hosting the Games at £8.9bn. 'Creative accounting' Prime Minister David Cameron said ""a lot of deals were done"" around the time of the Olympics. The report, for the UK Trade and Investment department (UKTI), said the Olympics resulted in: Much of the Olympic park and stadium for the Winter Olympics in Russia was ""designed and built by British businesses"", Mr Cameron told BBC Radio's Test Match Special. ""So there's real jobs, real money in the Olympics if we get it right."" But sports economist Stefan Szymanski said it was impossible to tell how much of the economic activity could be put down to the Games. ""It's almost like a bit of creative accounting. There's no way of testing whether what they're saying is really true."" Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and a former chief economist at the Cabinet Office, said attributing the economic benefits to the Olympics was ""a little far-fetched to say the least"". Business Secretary Vince Cable defended the figures in the report. ""A lot of people were very cynical about this... but as a result of all the work that was done we have this very considerable amount,"" he said. He added there was an ""upward estimate"" that, by 2020, the Games could have benefited the UK by as much as £40bn. 'Thrilling chapter' One engineering firm which was behind the Olympic park on the 2012 site said the Games had boosted its standing with other host countries and governments delivering large-scale transport and urban regeneration projects. Mike McNicholas from the Atkins consultancy said: ""What we saw in the run-up to the games was a huge interest from overseas governments and industry to look at how the Games was delivered."" But for businesses outside London, The Federation of Small Businesses said the impact of the Games had been a disappointment. ""The contracts we were expecting really didn't materialise,"" said national policy chairman Mike Cherry. As well as the financial impact of the Games, the report - Inspired by 2012: The legacy from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games - highlights its influence on sport and regeneration. It also says the Games volunteers inspired more people to take up similar roles in their communities. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations said there had been an ""encouraging"" boost to volunteering. But funding cuts to the voluntary sector left a ""question mark"" over the Games' legacy, executive director Justin Davis-Smith warned. The prime minister said: ""If you go back to when we first won the Olympics in 2005, we've got 1.4 million more people taking part in sport every week."" But BBC sports editor David Bond said in the last year participation had actually dropped by 200,000. Labour's Olympics spokeswoman Tessa Jowell called on the government to reverse the ""damage inflicted"" to school sport funding. The report also found that employment programmes by Boris Johnson the Mayor of London had failed to deliver long-term Olympic jobs for the capital with only a fraction of people going into the jobs predicted. In a message in the report, Olympics legacy ambassador Lord Coe, who chaired Games organiser Locog, said: ""Progress reflected in this report against each of the legacy commitments is a promising start. ""There can, however, be no room for complacency. Just as the Games took 10 years to win, plan and deliver, so legacy must be seen as a 10-year project to realise lasting change."" International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge said: ""The London 2012 Games have definitively served as a catalyst for development and improvements, both tangible and intangible, which would otherwise have taken decades to achieve.""",研究显示，2012年伦敦奥运会给英国经济带来价值99亿英镑的贸易与投资增长。,伦敦奥运会于去年7月下旬到8月初举行，伦敦残奥会于8月下旬到9月初举行。 一份政府报告把去年新签署的商业合同、额外销售与外国投资归功于奥运会的举办。 独立评估单位曾预计在2020年以前，伦敦奥运给英国带来的总收益将在280亿到410亿英镑之间。 去年秋天，英国政府曾预计主办伦敦奥运的费用将达到89亿英镑。 英国商业大臣凯布尔（ Vince Cable）说，“许多人对奥运会给经济带来的贡献表示怀疑，但我们所作的一切导致了今天的这个巨大成就。” 政府的这份报告检验了由于伦敦奥运会和奥运推广活动导致的出口贸易额与外国对英投资额。 经济增长的数据是依据已经签署的合同以及未来商业机会有可能带来的价值。 建造2012奥运公园的一家工程公司Atkins说，伦敦奥运会增强了他们在其他奥运主办国和政府中的声誉，扩大了他们赢得大型交通和城市振兴项目合同的机会。 报告也考虑了那些受伦敦奥运会影响而表示有意在英国投资的公司。 伦敦奥运会于去年7月下旬到8月初举行，伦敦残奥会于8月下旬到9月初举行。 自从伦敦奥运会开幕以来，英国得到了大约25亿英镑新的外国投资，这包括一家马来西亚集团重新开发伦敦巴特西电站的建设项目，中国技术公司华为和一家印度软件公司的投资项目。 报告还说，英国公司赢得价值15亿英镑的海外合同，包括参与其它全球体育赛事如2014年巴西世界杯和2016年里约奥运会和残奥会的建设项目。 报告还说，外交部和英国贸易与投资部发起的与奥运有关的公关推广活动也给英国带来了59亿英镑的额外出口销售额。 餐馆老板、英国餐饮业联合会主席理查德勋爵（Lord Richard）说，奥运会给伦敦作了一个相当好的广告，会让更多人来伦敦。 但是他批评伦敦市长约翰逊和政府鼓励人们在奥运比赛期间远离伦敦市中心的做法，因为此举让当地的餐馆经营惨淡。 他说，“现在可能（对经济）有好处了，但是当时的确让我们损失了不少银子。” BBC体育事务编辑大卫·邦德（David Bond）说，人们应该对政府有关伦敦奥运给经济带来的好处这一评估持谨慎态度。因为它并没有具体说明这99亿英镑的贸易与投资增长中有多少是直接由奥运会促成的。 他说，“也许没有奥运会，这个数字也能达到。” （编译/责编：尚清）
"Mr Hagel, who arrived in the port of Qingdao from Japan, is thought to be the first senior Western official to board the vessel. China bought it from Ukraine in 1998 and has spent 10 years refitting it. It is seen as a potent symbol of China's ambition to modernise its navy, amid a strategic shift in the region. The fact that the US secretary of defence was allowed to step on board the carrier will be seen as a sign that the two countries may be willing to engage in more military co-operation, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Washington has repeatedly called for more transparency from Beijing on its military spending, our correspondent adds. Sea trials US officials said that the defence chief's visit to the Liaoning at Yuchi naval base - which took place after a US request - lasted about two hours. No further details were immediately available and journalists accompanying him on the China visit did not go with him. The carrier was built in the 1980s for the Soviet navy but was never completed. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the rusting hull - then called the Varyag - sat in dockyards in Ukraine. A Chinese company with links to China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) then bought the Varyag, saying it wanted to turn the vessel into a floating casino in Macau. In 2001 the ship was towed to China. The Chinese military confirmed in June 2011 that it was being refitted to serve as the nation's first aircraft carrier. Earlier this year, it completed sea trials in the South China Sea, where China has overlapping territorial claims with several South East Asian nations. Beijing's more assertive stance on this issue in recent years has led to a rise in tensions between China and its neighbours, particularly Vietnam and the Philippines. China is also embroiled in a separate dispute over East China Sea islands that are controlled by Japan. In Tokyo, Mr Hagel addressed regional territorial disputes, saying Chinese authorities should have ""respect for their neighbours"". ""You cannot... redefine boundaries and violate territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations by force, coercion and intimidation, whether it's in small islands in the Pacific or large nations in Europe,"" he said. The Liaoning aircraft carrier has already attracted controversy. Late last year, Mr Hagel criticised China as ""irresponsible"" after the near-collision of a US warship and a Chinese naval vessel in the South China Sea. The US said its guided missile cruiser, USS Cowpens, was operating in international waters on 5 December when the Chinese vessel - which was accompanying the Liaoning - forced it to take evasive action. State-run newspaper Global Times, however, quoted an expert as saying that the US boat had been ""harassing"" the Liaoning as it carried out drills.",美国国防部长哈格尔周一（7日）在访问中国的第一天登上了中国唯一的一艘航空母舰辽宁号参观。,在哈格尔访问中国之前，美国方面向中国提出希望参观辽宁号航母，这一要求得到满足。 一名美国官员说，他们在青岛港登上辽宁舰，在上面逗留了约两个小时。 此前美国官员披露，在哈格尔访问中国之前，美国方面向中国提出希望参观辽宁号航母，这一要求得到满足。 象征意义 北京大学国际关系学院教授朱锋认为，哈格尔访华首日登上辽宁舰具有重要的象征意义。因为辽宁舰是中国的第一艘航母，而哈格尔又是第一位获邀参观辽宁舰的外国军方首脑。 他说：“这个举动在很大程度上向世界表明其实中国不仅愿意进一步深化中美军事交流，而且也愿意在防务交流中增大透明度和相互信任。” 就在哈格尔访华之际，中国军方报纸《解放军报》发表国防大学战略研究所副研究员鹿音的评论文章，指美中发展“新型军事关系”，有助于消除少数国家利用及制造两国矛盾，以谋取一己私利的企图。 文章不点名地指责亚太地区“一些第三方因素”也在干扰美中构建“新型军事关系”。 而哈格尔本人在访华前夕在日本东京发表讲话，以罕见的强硬姿态对中国发出警告，提醒中国作为大国强国不要在南海以及东海主权争端问题上仗势欺人。 第三方因素 对此朱锋表示，哈格尔的强硬表态显示美国防务高层现在对中国在东海和南海问题上的政策变得越来越强硬感到担忧，但这在很大程度上混淆了东海和南海的海洋领土争端问题上的是非和基本事实。 他说，日本将钓鱼岛国有化挑起东海领土争端，而菲律宾也是依仗美国的支持在南海问题上向中国频频发难。 朱锋认为，美国表面上看是主持公道，借东海和南海争端指责中国欺负邻国，但实际上也是利用日本和菲律宾与中国的摩擦坐收各种各样的红利，并乘机敲打中国。 《解放军报》的评论文章还指出，美中两军关系发展长时间呈现“发展、停滞、再发展、再停滞”的循环。 一段时间以来，美国对中国的军力扩张或是强均努力一直存有戒心，这是不是因为美国担心中国的军事崛起最终将打破亚太地区的军事平衡呢？ 新型军事关系 朱锋教授说，美国在这方面的担心实际上是多虑。因为尽管中国军事力量发展很快，但距离美国的军事力量还有很大的差距，特别是美国（在亚太地区）有巨大的军事同盟体系，而中国没有。 他说，中国增强军事力量是为了加强自己的防卫需求，因为随着中国经济的崛起，越来越多的中国人觉得中国正在变得越开越不安全。这是由于中国的崛起的过程实际上也是一种权力的再分配过程，在这个过程中会引发许多对中国的防范、戒备、猜疑，甚至非难。 朱锋说，大国关系永远是一个非常肮脏的关系，美国现在利用这些不稳定因素，利用这些国家向它求助的机会，来继续扮演自己在亚太地区的“老大”形象。 朱锋希望，中美构建大国关系，包括新型军事关系，都不应该受到这些第三方的影响。 他认为，中美防务和军事交流本质上应该成为“避免和防止中美从战略竞争走向战略对抗和冲突的重要阀门”。 他说，越是日本因素成为中美关系中的一个不稳定因素，中美两国越是要保持双方在防务和军事交流中的这种积极合作与对话的势头。 （撰稿：尚清 责编：横路）
"By Sarah Collerton and John HarrisonBBC News But behind the frontline of the pandemic there have been a huge number of people who have been busy doing essential jobs, as outlined by the government. They include those working across the food and transport industries, people providing childcare, working in public service and the financial sector. They have been allowed to travel to work and send their children to school while the rest of us have been in lockdown. We spoke to some of them to find out how lockdown has been. The falconer Matt Forward's job is to keep the pigeons away from Trafalgar Square. Pest management was covered in the key worker list, so throughout lockdown Matt drove himself and his Harris hawk 45 miles to the iconic square early two mornings a week. From 06:00, his ""little boy"" Lighten would fly around for a couple of hours - perching on Nelson's Column and the roof of the National Gallery. His presence alone was enough to keep the pigeons away. ""If I was a pigeon and saw this beast flying around everywhere I wouldn't want to nest and get too comfy,"" he says. Matt, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said he never thought of stopping his job because of lockdown. ""If someone wasn't there doing the job that we do, we'd be overrun,"" he says. Matt is new to the profession - he swapped his work as a plumber for the ""best job in the world"" a few months before lockdown. He saw a ""hell of a difference"" during lockdown, particularly because there were fewer people about, meaning there was less food waste for the pigeons to eat. ""People aren't dropping bags of crisps in Trafalgar Square anymore,"" he says, ""basically food isn't on a plate for them."" But because there is less food around, it's changed the behaviour of the pigeons. They seem a bit braver because they're hungrier, he says. After he finishes in Trafalgar Square, he takes his bird of prey to other places in the capital - London Stadium, museums, hotels. Matt says he loves that, despite coronavirus, people still come up to him to ask him about what he's doing. ""It's not as if I'm walking a dog down the road,"" he says. ""People show a lot of interest in it - that's one of the reasons I love it."" The asparagus farmers Lockdown has been ""a rollercoaster"" on Lunan Bay Farm, in Angus. Perched on the eastern coast of Scotland, the farm produces free range goat meat, honeyberries and other niche products. But a third of its business comes from asparagus - which has just a six-week season, running from early May until the middle of June. ""Covid hit us right before our asparagus started,"" says Jillian McEwan, who runs the farm with her husband Neil, a fifth-generation farmer. ""It is a high-intense time because it is such a short season."" As food producers, they also qualified as key workers, but were faced with a race to pick - and then sell - their asparagus right in the middle of lockdown. ""We were able to booster our workforce with people who had been furloughed or had been made redundant,"" Jillian says. They ended up with a team of 10-15 pickers, who all had to be equipped with masks, gloves and aprons. The farm usually uses lightweight tractors in the asparagus fields, with pickers filling baskets on a platform pulled behind it. But to ensure social distancing they needed a much larger platform, meaning a heavier tractor was required. Jillian worries about the impact the heavier machinery could have in the coming years. ""By compacting the ground it will have an impact on next year's crop. So there were a lot of consequences of Covid for us."" The farm has 15 acres of asparagus and harvested 7,500kg in the six weeks from 4 May. But then came the challenge of finding new customers to sell it to while it was fresh. The 70-plus restaurants who usually take most of it were all closed. Instead they've turned to small farm shops and independent retailers. Much of their asparagus has been delivered to people as part of veg boxes. ""It actually proved to be quite successful for us. We could have actually sold three times the amount of asparagus we produced."" The lock keeper ""I have 62 volunteers that help me run manage the locks,"" says Alex Goode, site manager at Foxton Locks, in Leicestershire. ""I went down to zero at the start of lockdown."" As a key worker, the operation of the area became Alex's responsibility during lockdown. Located on the Leicester section of the Grand Union Canal, Foxton boasts the longest and steepest set of staircase locks in the UK. It is a set of 10 individual locks, split into two by a passing area. In the height of summer it can see 30-45 boats pass through every day. With all but essential travel stopped on the canal system at the beginning of lockdown, that number fell to between one and four a day. Yet boaters still needed to pass through the locks. ""People who are living on their boats, it is their house, they still needed to get to areas where they could empty their toilets and fill up their water. Other people needed to move around to get to sick relatives, or to get somewhere to moor for lockdown."" Working mainly from home, he created a next day booking system, where all the boats wanting to pass had to register for a set time the following day, giving Alex time to arrive, unlock the locks, and make sure coronavirus protocols were being stuck to by boaters. Alex would also perform a daily safety check to make sure there was no damage or vandalism to the lock - or to the tow path, where locals came for their daily permitted exercise. He says about 10-15 boats a day now pass through Foxton and he is looking forward to the canal volunteers returning at the beginning of July. The speech therapist ""It resembled something out of ET,"" says Caitlin Rehal. The 37-year-old specialist speech and language therapist is describing the personal protective equipment she had to wear to see a 102-year-old patient. Neither were suspected of having coronavirus, but such PPE is just one of the changes Caitlin has seen in her profession since the pandemic hit. ""It was almost impossible to engage with this patient while wearing all of this gear,"" she said. ""It was very hard to get her to know I was a person trying to speak to her. My impression was it was as if a bin was speaking to her… like something was talking but perhaps it shouldn't be."" Caitlin says that as the PPE guidance has changed she hasn't been required to wear the ""ET"" outfit again - now a surgical mask, gloves and an apron are deemed suitable to see patients. As a specialist health key worker, she has continued to work at Tunbridge Wells Hospital, in Kent, during the pandemic, treating people struggling to communicate or swallow, which affects their eating and drinking. She says her team regularly sees patients who have had a brain injury, a fall, or those with dementia, Parkinson's or multiple sclerosis. And now Covid-19 - because it affects the respiratory system, it can have an impact on the way people swallow, she says. ""Overall we have had fewer patients but of those patients some of them are much higher risk. So it's been a bit of an adjustment,"" she says. It's also meant many of the patients her team treats have been younger than usual - aged in their 50s and 60s, rather than 70s and older. But because she has asthma, Caitlin has been unable to work with many of those higher risk patients. She can't see anyone suspected of having coronavirus, even with elaborate PPE. She says she's grateful for the support of her colleagues when she felt ""she wasn't able to pull her weight"". ""Their understanding and appreciation of the work I was able to do, in lieu of being able to be on the high-risk wards with them, was very important for my emotional health in a very stressful period.""

"Donald Tusk said there was ""presently no consensus"" within the EU about David Cameron's desire to restrict in-work payments for four years. Mr Tusk has written to EU leaders warning that uncertainty over the UK's future in the EU was ""destabilising"". The PM said he was encouraged the UK's reform agenda was being ""taken on"". But former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling warned that the UK's future in the EU was now ""in the balance"". Last month David Cameron set out his goal of a ""new settlement"" for the UK in the EU, made up of four key objectives: In his letter, Mr Tusk described the PM's plans as a ""significant and far-reaching agenda"". Of the four strands to the UK's demands, he said welfare reform was the most ""delicate"" and would require ""substantive political debate"" at this month's EU summit. Mr Cameron is attempting to reduce co-called ""pull factors"" for migrants in an attempt to reduce immigration figures. Mr Tusk wrote: ""This is certainly an issue where we need to hear more from the British prime minister and an open debate among ourselves before proceeding further."" On the demand to protect the interests of countries like the UK which are members of the EU but not of the euro currency, Mr Tusk said non-eurozone countries could have a mechanism to raise concerns, but appeared to rule out a ""veto"" right. 'Honest broker' On the question of the founding principle of ""ever-closer union"", he does not offer a view one way or the other on the UK's request to be exempted from that goal. Mr Tusk said the idea of ""ever closer union"" allowed countries to integrate at different levels and that there was a ""largely-shared view"" on the importance of national parliaments. The European Council president said good progress was being made in the talks, describing his role as that of an ""honest broker"" and saying all states had to show ""readiness for compromise"". He added: ""Uncertainty about the future of the UK in the European Union is a destabilising factor. That is why we must find a way to answer the British concerns as quickly as possible."" Mr Cameron said ""of course"" the whole renegotiation was difficult and said he hoped for a successful conclusion. His official spokeswoman said Mr Tusk's letter ""marks another step forward in the renegotiations"". UK's EU referendum in-depth Q&A: What Britain wants from Europe Guide to the UK's planned in-out EU referendum BBC News EU referendum special report The PM, who has not ruled out campaigning to leave if his demands are refused, has already said a deal will not be reached by Christmas. Mr Tusk recently said this month's EU summit should ""pave the way"" for a deal by February. 'Compromise' Robert Oxley, from the Vote Leave campaign, was dismissive of the PM's demands. ""The one thing you could not describe these reforms as is ambitious,"" he told the BBC. But Lucy Thomas, of Britain Stronger In Europe, said it was a ""really good agenda for reform"" which ""the rest of Europe wants to see as well"". However, Mr Darling suggested that Mr Cameron's demands would have little impact on the final result of the referendum and those, like him, who wanted the UK to remain in the EU were not starting the campaign in ""a great place"". ""What I do say is if we don't start making the argument soon in a way that impinges on the consciousness of the people of this country, the risk is you are leaving it awfully late."" Meanwhile Syed Kamall, leader of the British Conservatives in the European Parliament, suggested there would have to be a compromise on the deal, saying ""that's the way business is done in this town"". ""You are going to see a compromise of some form, but both sides will be pushing as hard as possible. I know the British Government will definitely be pushing for all four of their demands but let's see what the compromise is at the end of the day,"" he told BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth.",欧洲理事会主席塔斯克表示，尽管英国首相卡梅伦要求针对欧盟移民进行福利制度改革，但这一要求与欧盟“存在巨大政治分歧”。,欧洲理事会主席塔斯克表示，欧盟领导人和英国首相卡梅伦在英国提出的改革目标上存在巨大分歧。 英国首相卡梅伦急切希望能将欧盟移民申请工作福利的年限延长到四年，但塔斯克说，目前欧盟和卡梅伦的要求“不存在任何共识”。 在塔斯克写给其他欧盟领导人的信中，他警告英国在欧盟问题上的不确定性会对欧盟起到“动摇作用”。 但英国首相卡梅伦称，英国希望改革欧盟的议题能被讨论本身就“令人鼓舞”。 前英国政府财相、工党的达林警告说，英国是否将继续留在欧盟的命运现在“悬而未决”。 卡梅伦在上月提出了与欧盟谈判的四大目标，但塔斯克形容这四大核心目标是一个“重要且影响深远的议题”。 卡梅伦提出的四大核心目标包括： 但塔斯克认为，这四项要求中的福利制度改革“最敏感”，需要在本月举行的欧盟峰会上“进行持久的政治辩论”。 英国首相卡梅伦希望能减少英国对欧盟移民的“吸引力”，从而减少移民数量。 英国首相卡梅伦希望借欧盟福利制度改革，以减少英国对欧盟移民的吸引力。 塔斯克在信中写道：“我们肯定需要听取英国首相就这个议题的更多细节内容，并且在进入下一步程序前展开公开辩论。” 在有关保护包括英国在内的非欧元国家利益问题上，塔斯克认为，非欧元国家应该有表达意愿的机制，但似乎他并不认同让非欧元国家也享有“否决权”。 “野心太大” 欧洲理事会主席塔斯克在有关免除英国加入一个“前所未有紧密联盟的”欧盟问题上不置可否。 他指出，所谓“前所未有紧密的联盟”将允许欧盟各国在不同水准上变得更加紧密，并说各国自己议会的重要性也得到“广泛认同”。 他补充说：“英国在是否继续留在欧盟的不确定性是一个会起到动摇作用的因素。正因为如此，我们必须尽快找到回复英国诉求的答案。” 英国首相卡梅伦表示，与欧盟的谈判“当然”是困难的，但他希望能有一个成功的结局。 卡梅伦的发言人说，塔斯克的表态“标志着谈判又向前推进了一步”。 英国首相卡梅伦日前提出了和欧盟谈判的四大核心目标。 此前声称若条件不能满足将站到脱离欧盟这一方来的卡梅伦说，他估计在圣诞节前不会有实质结果。 塔斯克曾说，本月的欧盟峰会将为欧盟与英国在二月份达成协议“铺平道路”。 在英国主张脱离欧盟的一方强调卡梅伦的目标“野心太大”，但主张留在欧盟的一方表示，这些目标是“促成改革的好议题”。 曾在前英国工党政府担任财相的达林认为，卡梅伦无论谈与不谈，都不会对英国全民公决结果产生任何影响。
"The woman, Yujing Zhang, 32, told security she was at the Florida club to go to the pool, according to a criminal complaint filed in US District Court. ""Due to a potential language barrier issue,"" staff believed she was related to a club member and let her in. Mr Trump was in Palm Beach at the time of the incident on Saturday 30 March. Ms Zhang - who was described in the affidavit as an ""Asian female"" - is charged with making false statements to a federal officer and illegally entering a restricted area. According to the court documents, upon entry to the club Ms Zhang changed her story, telling a front-desk receptionist she was there to attend a ""United Nations Chinese American Association"" event. The receptionist, who knew that such an event had been scheduled, became suspicious of Ms Zhang. The suspect was transported off the property for further questioning. She told agents she had been instructed by a friend, identified only as ""Charles"", to travel from Shanghai, China, to Palm Beach to attend the purported United Nations event, but did not provide any more details, according to court documents. She said ""Charles"" had encouraged her to attempt to speak to a member of the president's family about Chinese-American economic relations, said the affidavit. Secret service agent Samuel Ivanovich said Ms Zhang carried four mobile phones, a laptop, an external hard drive and a thumb drive containing a computer virus, but no swim suit. In the court document, Mr Ivanovich notes that Ms Zhang ""freely and without difficulty conversed"" in English, becoming ""verbally aggressive"" with authorities as the investigation progressed. The Secret Service said in a statement that it ""does not determine who is invited or welcome at Mar-a-Lago; this is the responsibility of the host entity. ""The Mar-a-Lago club management determines which members and guests are granted access to the property."" Ms Zhang's lawyer has so far declined comment.

"Security plans will be reviewed and any necessary lessons learned, the home secretary said in a Commons statement.

She said those who had attacked Paris ""represent no-one and they will fail"" to divide free countries such as Britain and France. ""France grieves but she does not grieve alone. People of all faiths, all nationalities and all backgrounds around the world are with you and together we will defeat them,"" she said. Analysis By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner The announcement on Monday that Britain's intelligence and security agencies are to be given a massive boost in resources has taken some there by surprise. Expecting a modest boost in the coming Strategic Defence and Security Review, they have now been told they are to get a 15% increase in headcount, raising their numbers by 1,900. For MI5, the Security Service and MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service, this will take some time to absorb, perhaps years. They will need to find, recruit, vet and train new intelligence officers largely from scratch. But for GCHQ, the government's secret listening station in Cheltenham, it will be relatively easier for them to recruit already-qualified IT analysts and linguists from the commercial marketplace. Deploying extra aviation security officers should also show results fairly quickly. They will be expected to assess security in overseas airports used by large numbers of Britons where security is suspected of being lax. Mrs May said police and emergency services had been prepared for the possibility of a ""marauding gun attack"" in the UK since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, but plans would be reviewed in light of Friday's events. ""As soon as the attacks took place, we took steps to maintain the security of the UK,"" she said. ""The police have increased their presence on some streets and at some locations, and they will be intensifying their approach at events in big cities."" The UK's Border Force had intensified checks on people, goods and vehicles entering the UK - and was carrying out ""targeted"" security checks against passengers and vehicles travelling to France, the home secretary added. She also said she would be lobbying her European counterparts for tighter gun laws across the European Union. In other developments: Mrs May said that in recent months, ""a number of serious plots"" had been disrupted in the UK, adding there could be ""little doubt"" that the threat posed by IS militants was evolving. More than 750 people are thought to have travelled from the UK to Syria and Iraq, and approximately half of those have returned, she said. The terror threat level in the UK has been at ""severe"" - meaning an attack is highly likely - since last August. Earlier, Mr Cameron said world leaders had agreed to do more to share intelligence and cut off funding for terrorists, as the Paris attacks ""underlined the threat we all face"". Speaking at the G20 summit in Turkey, he said the gap between Russia and the West's position on Syria ""has been enormous"", but now ""everyone recognises the need for compromise"". Meanwhile in the UK, officers from the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command unit are interviewing people returning from France who may have information. The Met is also appealing for any potential witnesses to contact its anti-terrorist hotline, on 0800 789 321. Main attack sites: Bataclan concert venue, 50 Boulevard Voltaire, 11th district - 89 dead when stormed by gunmen, three of whom were killed; another gunman died nearby La Belle Equipe, 92 rue de Charonne, 11th district - 19 dead in gun attacks Le Carillon bar and Le Petit Cambodge restaurant at rue Alibert, 10th district - 15 dead in gun attacks La Casa Nostra restaurant, 92 rue de la Fontaine au Roi, 11th district - five dead in gun attacks Stade de France, St Denis, just north of Paris - explosions heard outside venue, three attackers and a bystander killed",英国内政大臣特里莎·梅称，英国大城市的各项活动以及英国边境都将“加强安保措施”。,巴黎连环袭击后，英国加强了各地的安保措施。 特里莎-梅在英国议会发表的声明中说，安保措施将再次被评估，过往的教训也将被汲取。 她同时呼吁在欧洲实行更加严格的枪支管制法律。 伦敦大都会警方此前透露，他们正在英国全境调查600起涉恐案件。 英法足球热身赛将于周二晚在伦敦温布利体育场举行。威廉王子将以英格兰足总主席的身份出席，伦敦市长约翰逊也将计划出席。 伦敦警方负责人特里在一份声明中说：“我们希望前来观看比赛的民众知道，现场增强的警力为的是确保他们的安全。” 他指出，警力增强“仅仅是预防措施”，而“并非针对特定情报作出的安排”。 法国国家队队长洛里斯赛前表达了有些法国国家队球员对参加这场热身赛的担忧，并承认是法国足协要求他们必须参加这场比赛。 英格兰国家队在周二晚与法国国家队在温布利体育场进行热身赛。 他说：“我们尊重法国足协的决定，法国的国家荣誉高于法国国家足球队。” “他们不会得逞” 英国内政大臣特里莎·梅在英国议会发表讲话时确认，为英国情报部门MI5、MI6和GCHQ额外增加招聘的1900名安保情报官员，将得到特别拨款的支持。资金投入总额将增加15%。 她说，发动巴黎连环袭击者“不代表任何人”，他们企图分裂诸如英国和法国这样的自由国家的阴谋“一定不会得逞”。 她说：“法国不是一个人在悲痛。全世界不同信仰、不同国家和不同文化背景的人都和法国民众在一起。我们一定会打败袭击者。” BBC安全事务记者加德纳认为，额外注入的资源将极大鼓舞英国的情报和安保部门，但这些部门大部分都需要假以时日，才能培养出新一批的情报官员。 早些时候，在土耳其参加G20峰会的英国首相卡梅伦说，与会的全球领导人都同意要为共享情报和切断恐怖分子的资金来源，做出更多努力。 卡梅伦说，周五在巴黎发生的连环袭击“说明了这是我们都要面对的威胁”。 （责编：路西）
"By Kelly-Leigh CooperBBC News Under the initiative, proposed by Environment Southland, cat owners in Omaui will have to neuter, microchip and register their moggies with local authorities. After their pet dies, cat lovers in the community will then not be allowed to get any more. It sounds extreme, but it may be something more communities should be considering: after all, cats are responsible for the death of billions of birds and mammals each year - and, according to some, it is all our fault. Dr Peter Marra, the head of the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Centre, has authored journals and books on the issue. Contrary to preconceptions about him, he insists he is not anti-cat or against cat ownership. ""Cats make wonderful pets - they're spectacular pets! But they shouldn't be allowed to roam outside - it's a really obvious solution,"" he told the BBC. ""We would never let dogs do that. It's about time we treat cats like dogs."" In Omaui, officials say the measure is justified because cameras have shown roaming cats preying on birds, insects and reptiles in the area. ""So your cat can live out its natural life at Omaui happily doing what it's doing. But then when it dies, you wouldn't be able to replace it,"" bio-security operations manager Ali Meade explained. Under the plan, anyone not complying would receive a notice, before officials would remove the pets - but only as an ""absolute last resort"". The initiative is part of the regional council's proposed regional pest management plan, which was opened for consultation on Tuesday. John Collins, chairman of the Omaui Landcare Charitable Trust, championed the ban to protect ""high-value"" nature reserves there. 'We're not cat haters, but we want our environment to be wildlife-rich,"" he said, the Otago Daily Times reports. How big a problem are cats? The debate about cat populations and local eco-systems is not unique to Omaui. Conservation scientists have long warned about the impact of feral and outdoor cats on the global eco system - and they've been ranked among the 100 worst non-native invasive species in the world. Dr Marra says 63 species extinctions around the world are now linked to the booming cat populations. The problem is exacerbated in areas with very sensitive eco-systems, like New Zealand. ""It sounds extreme,"" he says. ""But the situation has got out of control."" He believes cat-lovers around the world need to embrace a ""different mind-set"" toward the animals. He believes they should be adopted where possible, then neutered and exercised at home using toys, or in a controlled environment - for example, on a leash. ""This predicament is not the fault of cats - it's humans' fault,"" he insists. Because of their popularity on social media and in memes, the global pet population shows no sign of abating. ""They are just cute - everything about them, which makes this whole thing more difficult."" Accurate estimates are hard to ascertain, but in the US there are about 86 million pet cats - roughly one in every three households. Unquantifiable amounts live stray or feral, meaning huge casualties in the environment. It is estimated that as many as four billion birds and 22 billion mammals are killed by cats in the US every year. Even in the UK, populations are on the decline, and experts blame cats. The Mammal Society says that about 55 million birds are falling casualty each year. 'Natural-born killers' It's not the first time cats have been painted as a menace in New Zealand - a country boasting a feline in almost half its households. They're a hot issue in Australia too, where feral and outdoor cats are blamed for millions of native species' deaths every night. The nation has been funding grassroots culling initiatives since 2015, boasts the world's largest cat-proof fence and has even considered introducing a national curfew for domestic cats. Councils and state governments have been taking the cat problem into their own hands - forcing cats to stay indoors at night, implementing household quotas and mandatory identification and neutering. Nevertheless, initiatives against felines remain controversial. Last year animal rights groups laid particular scorn at one Queensland local council who were offering $10 bounties for feral cat scalps. In Omaui, residents told local media they were ""shocked"" and ""hoodwinked"" by the proposed ban and have vowed to resist it. Nico Jarvis, a local resident who says her three cats help combat rodents in her house, compared the proposal to a ""police state"". ''It's not even regulating people's ability to have a cat. It's saying you can't have a cat,'' she told the Otago Daily Times. Paw Justice, a New Zealand-based non-profit that focuses on animal abuse, posted about the plan on Facebook, questioning the evidence behind it. Cat-lovers on the group's Facebook page reacted angrily to the news and pointing out that poisons, cars and humans also damage native species. Local residents have until the end of October to register their submissions to Environment Southland's plan.

"BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie has been asked to talk to staff about the shelved broadcast last December. The discussion will be fed back to the BBC Trust chairman, Lord Patten. The corporation has always said the decision to drop the film was taken for ""editorial reasons"". A statement from the BBC said: ""This is not a review. The director general has simply asked Ken MacQuarrie to talk to members of the Newsnight team who had emailed him."" Newsnight editor Peter Rippon has previously insisted it was his decision to drop the story following newspaper reports that he was ordered to drop the investigation. Writing in a BBC Editors blog, he said: ""It has been suggested I was ordered to do it by my bosses as part of a BBC cover-up. It has also been suggested that we deliberately withheld information from the police. ""Both these allegations are totally untrue and, despite consistent strong denials, keep getting repeated."" He said some of his team ""disagreed strongly"" with the decision but that others ""agreed equally strongly"". ""However, those who disagreed accepted my decision. There were no rows of any kind as has been reported,"" he said. The Metropolitan Police is now leading an inquiry into claims of abuse against the Leeds-born presenter and is pursuing 120 separate lines of inquiry. A further two forces have referred a total of three new complaints to Scotland Yard, it has emerged. Hospital assaults Fresh allegations about Savile are continuing to emerge. On Friday, a woman told the BBC that Savile abused a 12-year-old girl during a visit to a children's home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in the 1970s. She said the victim told her Savile indecently touched her after they went upstairs together. Meanwhile, several hospitals are investigating allegations that Savile preyed on children during visits to wards as part of a catalogue of abuse. Leeds General Infirmary has received two complaints of sexual assault by Savile dating back to the 1970s. It is also claimed he groped patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire, where he was a volunteer fundraiser. The Conservative Party chairman, Grant Shapps, said on BBC One's Question Time that there were questions to be answered and ""the BBC knows that"". He described the number of people who had come forward with claims of abuse as ""disturbing"". He also said he would be in favour of the Honours Forfeiture Committee looking at whether or not it could strip Savile of his knighthood, despite the Cabinet Office previously stating there were currently no legal arrangements in place to remove honours posthumously. Part of the reason is that an OBE or a knighthood expires when a person dies. Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint, who also appeared on the programme, said there should be a close look at the BBC ""as an institution"" and whether there was more it could have done. Meanwhile, the Sun claimed Savile assaulted a 17-year-old patient during a visit to Broadmoor as a hospital fundraiser in the 1970s. The claim is being investigated by its NHS trust. But West London Mental Health NHS Trust said it had not been approached by police or any former patients or their representatives with any allegations. The BBC will also hold an inquiry into allegations Savile abused girls while working for the corporation after the police investigation is completed. A figure from outside the corporation will run it.",BBC旗舰节目《新闻之夜》（Newsnight）的很多工作人员对于该节目组对前电视节目主持人吉米·萨维尔（Jimmy Savile）进行调查的计划被取消提出了质疑。,对萨维尔性侵犯的指称不断付出水面。 总裁乔治·恩特威斯尔（George Entwistle）已经要求一名资深官员对此进行内部答疑。 BBC苏格兰区总监肯·麦克库阿雷（Ken MacQuarrie）被告知就去年12月取消对萨维尔的调查节目与员工进行谈话。 而有关的会谈内容将会被上报到BBC信托主席彭定康。 BBC一直都表示，取消播放该节目是出于编辑原因。 BBC发表声明说，这不是一个评估审查，总裁只是要求麦克库阿雷与《新闻之夜》工作人员进行谈话。 有报道称，该节目总编辑彼得·里蓬（Peter Rippon）被迫停止调查，但随后他坚持说取消有关节目是自己的决定。 在谈及有关的决定时，他说，我们工作组的一部分成员对于（停止调查的）决定非常不认同，但是也有其它的成员非常认同。 他说，然而那些不认同这个做法的同事接受了我的决定。没有向报道中所说的出现争执。 伦敦警察署现在已经开始就萨维尔性侵犯指称进行调查。 而有关萨维尔性侵的指称仍然在继续浮出水面。 周五，一名妇女对BBC表示，萨维尔在1970年代前往一家儿童院的时候曾经性侵犯了一名12岁的女童。 与此同时，有多家医院正在调查有关萨维尔在探访时对一些儿童进行性侵的指称。 之前BBC已经承诺在警方完成了一切调查之后将会就他在工作期间对很多女子性侵的指称进行彻查。 上周，陆续有女性出来指控萨维尔在事业如日中天时曾性侵犯包括少女在内的多名女性，有些甚至发生在BBC楼内。 与内文相关的链接 相关话题
"By Celia HattonBBC News But behind the scenes, much larger deals are helping to move money at an unprecedented rate. Wealth is flowing from the mainland, through currency dealers in Hong Kong and beyond. The leaked Mossack Fonseca documents have revealed to us how the families of China's leaders keep money offshore. And now, a full analysis of the files by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shows that nearly one third of the firm's business came from its offices in Hong Kong and China - making China the firm's biggest market and Hong Kong the company's busiest office. Destabilising the economy? Mossack Fonseca's booming China business is evidence of an even bigger trend: the reliance of China's wealthiest people on offshore investments. Around $1tn (£700bn) left China last year, draining the country's foreign reserves. It is a shift that could destabilise the entire Chinese economy. And the relatives of China's leaders are among those who have stashed their wealth abroad. At least seven current and former leaders were found to have links to offshore companies set up by the Panamanian law firm, including the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, and two other top leaders. Many of these names have circulated in connection with offshore banking before, in past media reports. However, the leaked files come at a tricky time for China's leadership. Owning offshore companies is not illegal in China but the existence of these secretive financial structures raises all sorts of questions for the families of China's leaders. China's Communist officials are supposed to lead ""clean"" lifestyles that discourage them from profiting from their ruling positions, according to the party's constitution. And importantly, their families are not supposed to profit from their ties to the top. Willy Lam, a political analyst with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, says Xi Jinping has portrayed himself as ""a purist in terms of morality and frugality"". Stashing vast sums in offshore accounts ""definitely goes against the teachings of Xi Jinping and also well-known conventions of the Communist Party"", he says. ""As to whether the offspring of senior cadres have obtained their wealth illegally, it's difficult to say because the Chinese legal system is very opaque."" Capital flight The files tell us more than we ever knew before about how the Chinese elite's money is stored abroad. Long email chains reveal that Mossack Fonseca repeatedly helped politically connected clients to become offshore company shareholders without exploring their backgrounds, as they are required to do under international law. For example, Mossack Fonseca helped Deng Jiagui, the brother-in-law of Chinese President Xi Jinping, to create three offshore companies located in the British Virgin Islands. However, the firm failed to investigate Mr Deng's high-profile political connections when helping him to acquire his companies, in 2004 and again in 2009. It is unclear what the companies were used for though one had been dissolved and the other two were dormant by the time Mr Deng's powerful relative, Xi Jinping, took the helm of the Communist Party in 2012. But the irony cannot be overlooked: since coming to power, Xi Jinping has unleashed an intense anti-corruption campaign on the Communist Party. More than 300,000 officials were punished for violating the party's anti-corruption laws in 2015 alone. What is happening at Mossack Fonseca is being replicated elsewhere too. Rich Chinese are using Hong Kong as a gateway - to protect their wealth by moving it overseas. ""People are worried about keeping their money in China for two reasons,"" explains Andrew Collier, an independent China analyst based in Hong Kong. ""One is that the Chinese economy is slowing. The second reason is that the leadership has been trying to clean up corruption and there's some sense that some people are trying to move their money offshore because they're worried about the safety of their capital within China."" Hong Kong has become a focal point for those who want to stop money leaving China. Last month, China's anti-corruption office acknowledged that most money flowed through Hong Kong and vowed to stop the practice, though that might be an impossible task. 'There would be panic' Around $600bn of the money that left China last year was transferred in defiance of Chinese banking controls. Every Chinese citizen can only transfer $50,000 a year outside the country. Anything more than that is often moved illegally. Some people use complex money transfers to get their cash out. One illegal currency changer we spoke to explained how he helped clients secretly transfer money abroad by keeping vast reserves of money in dozens of ""zombie"" accounts spread across China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and the Philippines. He uses bank accounts that are still under the names of dead people to ensure they cannot be traced back to him. ""I receive my client's money into one account in one country and then transfer the currency they need into a different account in another country,"" he explains, smiling. However, he says he will not accept any more business from clients who want to take Renminbi out of China. ""I have too much Renminbi already,"" he says, frowning. What would happen if China cracked down on currency traders like him and actually enforced their own rules more tightly? ""Panic. There would be panic."" Money mules The movement of capital is fuelled by anxiety. ""People do not have faith in the ability of the financial and economic decision-making team to put things right,"" Willy Lam explains. ""So if they have one or two million US dollars, it would be stupid for them not to at least park half of that wealth overseas. Simply because there is very little faith in the future of the party."" Those who cannot access big-time currency traders sometimes rely on money mules to carry thick stacks of cash across the border. We met one man who works as a mule, who confirmed he was busy carrying money for his anxious clients. ""If my customers want to immigrate or invest in a business overseas, they need my help,"" he explained. ""Sometimes I strap the money on to my body or I carry a small bag. Customs officers always target people with lots of luggage or those who look nervous, so I just try to act normal."" So why does it matter if China's richest people move their wealth out of the country? Once money leaves China, it has to go somewhere. This massive flow of money is driving up real estate prices worldwide. According to juwai.com, a real estate website that connects mainland Chinese clients with foreign sellers, Chinese buyers spent more than $52bn on foreign property last year. In Hong Kong, visitors from mainland China splash out on luxury items. This is replicated around the globe: China's richest people - perhaps even those at the very top - are spending and storing their money elsewhere. They are protecting themselves but they are making China more vulnerable. Panama Papers - tax havens of the rich and powerful exposed",在香港银行大楼的背景下，有一排排的兑换外币的店铺，进行着快速和匿名的一些交易。,这个景象的背后，是数额更大的资金以史无前例的速度在转移。内地的财富经过香港或海外的外汇交易商外流。去年，有大约一万亿美元资金从中国外流，令外汇储备缩水。 这一变化可能会动摇中国的整体经济。 莫萨克·冯赛卡（Mossack Fonseca）泄露出来的文件，让我们了解到中国领导人的家人如何把钱转到海外。 至少7名现任和前任领导人与这家巴拿马公司所设立的离岸公司有牵连，包括中国国家主席习近平和另两名领导人。 这项丑闻涉及的中国现任及前任领导人家族成员： 现任领导人： 前任领导人： 这些名字此前在与离岸银行相关的报道中出现。但是，新文件泄露的时机对中国领导人来说比较棘手。 拥有离岸公司在中国并不违法，但这些隐秘金融机构的存在给中国领导人的家庭提出了各种疑问。 根据党章，中国共产党的官员应该“廉洁”，不能从以权谋私，他们的家属也不能从与高层的关系中获利。 香港城市大学政治评论员林和立说，习近平把自己塑造成“一个在道德和廉洁上纯粹的人”。 他说，在海外帐户上存放着大量的资金“明显与习近平的要求和共产党的传统相悖”。 “至于高官子女是否非法取得财富，这很难说，毕竟中国司法体系太隐晦。” 莫萨克·冯赛卡公司帮助习近平的姐夫邓家贵在英属维尔京群岛上设立了三家离岸公司。（资料图片） 资本逃逸 巴拿马文件透露了更多的关于中国权贵阶层海外资金状况。大批的电子邮件显示，莫萨克·冯赛卡（Mossack Fonseca）公司没有按照国际法的要求，在没有做背景调查的情况下，长期帮助一些有政治关系的客户成为离岸公司的股东。 比如，莫萨克·冯赛卡帮助习近平的姐夫邓家贵在英属维尔京群岛上设立了三家离岸公司。 但是，莫萨克·冯赛卡在2004年和2009年帮助邓家贵购买公司的时候，并没有调查邓与中共高层的关联。 尚不清楚这三家公司是被用来做什么的，尽管其中一家已解散，另两家在习近平2012年担任中共中央总书记后成为休眠公司。 这其中的讽刺意味很明显：自从习近平上台后，他在党内展开了密集的反腐运动，仅2015年，就有超过30万官员因违反反腐条例被惩处。 在莫萨克·冯赛卡发生的事情也在别的地方被复制。富有的中国人利用香港作为跳板，将资金挪到海外，以便保护他们的财产。 在香港的独立中国分析员安德鲁·科利尔（Andrew Collier）说：“把钱放在中国通常有两点担心。第一，中国经济放缓；第二，中国领导层试图清理腐败，有些人担心钱放在中国不安全，因此要把资金挪到海外。” 香港成为中国封堵资金外流的焦点。上月，中国反贪官员表示，外流的资金大多途经香港，并表示要阻止这一势头，尽管这可能很难做到。 “出现恐慌” 尽管中国的银行加强管控，去年大约有6.5亿美元的资金离开中国。中国公民每年只能五万美元的外汇额度，超过这个限额的资金转移就是违法。有些人利用复杂的转帐来将资金转移出境。 一名非法外汇交易员告诉我们，他是如何通过在中国、香港、越南和菲律宾的大批“僵尸”账户将资金秘密转到海外。 他利用那些已去世的人的名下账户，来确保无法追查到他自己。 他笑着说：“我将客户的钱存到某个国家的某个账户，然后兑换后将钱存到另一个国家的另一个帐户。” 但是，他不再接受那些试图把人民币从中国转移到海外的生意了。 他皱着眉头说：“我已经有了太多的人民币。” 如果中国对他这样的人采取打压，更严格地执法会怎么样呢？ 他说：“恐慌，那就会有恐慌。” 北京国际机场。（资料图片） 钱骡 资本流动的背后是焦虑。 林和立说：“人们对金融和经济决策团队的能力没有信心。如果他们有一、两百万美元，不在海外存放一半的资金那就是愚蠢的，因为他们对党的未来没有什么信心。” 那些无法得到大牌外汇交易员服务的人，就依靠“钱骡”来帮助他们把钱弄到海外。我们见到了一名钱骡，他告诉我们他业务繁忙，帮助焦虑的客户把钱挪到海外。 “如果我的客户想移民，或者在境外投资，他们就需要我的帮助。” “有时我把现金绑在身上，或者装进一个小袋子里。海关人员经常针对行李很多的人、或看上去紧张的人来检查，所以我就尽量保持镇静。” 中国最富裕的人把钱转移到海外有何影响呢？ 钱一旦离开的中国，就必须有一个去向。 大量资金外流推高了全球的房价。根据从事华人海外购房生意的居外海外房产网（juwai.com）介绍，中国买家去年花费520亿美元购买境外房产。 在香港，来自内地的中国人挥重金购买高端房产。这在其它地方也是如此——中国最富裕的人在各地存放和消费他们资金，也许包括最高层的人。 他们试图保护自己，但这让中国变得更脆弱。 （编译：高毅 责编：路西） 网友如有评论，请用下表： 网友反馈 今天沒看到愛國人士說西方媒體妖言惑眾搗亂中國

"Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere also announced plans to speed up the deportation of foreign criminals. He announced extra personnel, equipment and surveillance powers for the police. But he rejected banning the public wearing of the burka (the Islamic full veil). And he resisted pressure to ease medical confidentiality. Some of his conservative Christian Democrat (CDU) colleagues have urged a burka ban but Mr de Maiziere said it would be ""problematic"" and ""you cannot ban everything that you reject"". Mr de Maiziere was responding to recent attacks linked to militant Islamists. Two terror attacks by Islamist migrants shocked Germany last month - in Wuerzburg and Ansbach. Citizenship debate ""I propose that German citizens who are fighting with terror militias in other countries, and take part in combat operations there, if they have a second nationality - and only then - they would lose German citizenship,"" he told a news conference. There was a move in France recently to deprive jihadists of their French citizenship, but it did not get through parliament. German media report that the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) - the CDU's coalition partners - strongly oppose any general ban on dual citizenship. The Greens are also against the idea. ""My proposals are limited to the points that can lead to more security rapidly,"" Mr de Maiziere said. One of the new measures is to make ""promoting terrorism"" a criminal offence. On deportation, Mr de Maiziere said there would be no tolerance of foreign offenders who used false identities in order to stay in Germany. Key election issue - the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin writes: Germany hasn't experienced a major coordinated terror attack on the scale of Paris or Brussels - yet. A senior intelligence source has told the BBC that his agents are investigating hundreds of reports that Islamic State (IS) has sent so-called hit squads into the country, disguised as refugees, and that the risk of such an attack is very high. Political reaction to that threat will dominate campaigning ahead of next year's general election. Already it has ignited a fierce debate, which extends well beyond domestic security. Some of Mr de Maiziere's fellow conservatives - who are losing votes to right-wing populists - want him to ban burkas and outlaw dual citizenship altogether. Why is doctors' confidentiality an issue? The duty of doctors to respect patient confidentiality is enshrined in the German constitution. And German privacy laws are very strict. But Mr de Maiziere said he would meet senior doctors to discuss how they could more easily tip off police when they suspected a patient was a terror risk. In three major cases the perpetrators were found to have been mentally unstable: German doctors who breach patient confidentiality can face up to a year in prison or be forced to pay a fine. Frank Ulrich Montgomery, the head of the German Medical Association, said: ""Patient confidentiality protects patients' privacy and is a basic right under the constitution."" What is going on in Germany? German press concern at spate of violence What drives individuals to commit mass killings? How will surveillance be improved? Mr de Maiziere is expected to attract broad support for creating 4,600 new national security jobs, including 3,250 more police, and for improving police equipment. Germany is also likely to introduce more video surveillance in urban areas, a special police cyber defence unit and powers to investigate suspects as young as 14. There will be a big push to intercept terror networks that use the ""darknet"" to plan attacks or obtain weapons, the minister said. It is an area of cyberspace invisible to ordinary internet users.",根据新的反恐建议，具有双重国籍的德国人如果在海外参加伊斯兰极端组织作战将失去德国公民资格。,德国内政部长托马斯•德迈齐埃宣布说警察将增加人员，设备和监视权力 德国内政部长托马斯•德迈齐埃宣布了加速遣返外国罪犯的新计划。他宣布说，警察将增加人员、设备和监视权力。 不过他说，不会禁止公共场合穿伊斯兰女性的罩袍。他也顶住了要求放开医疗隐私的压力。 不过托马斯•德迈齐埃在基民盟的一些同僚则敦促全面禁止穿伊斯兰女性的罩袍。但是德迈齐埃说那样会带来问题。“你不能反对什么就禁止什么，”他说。 德迈齐埃是针对最近同伊斯兰激进主义相关的暴力攻击作出上述回应的。上月两次由伊斯兰移民发动的攻击震惊了德国。 此前，法国也采取行动剥夺那些圣战者的法国国籍，但是法国国会并没有通过这个建议。 德迈齐埃说，他的建议仅限于那些能够迅速加强安全的措施。其中一个新措施就是将“支持恐怖主义”刑事入罪。 在德国面临明年大选以及更早的地区选举的时候，安全问题已经成了紧迫的政治议题。 德国媒体报道说，中间偏左的社民党及其联合政府伙伴基民盟都强烈反对禁止双重国籍的禁令。绿党也反对上述禁令。 医疗隐私 德国宪法规定了医生尊重患者的隐私。但是内政部长托马斯•德迈齐埃说，他会同高级医生会谈讨论，在发现患者构成恐怖主义风险的时候如何能够更容易地向警察通报情况。 在三次重要的恐怖案件中，肇事者都有精神不稳定的问题。 在德国，医生侵犯患者隐私权可能会面临长达一年的监禁，或被迫支付罚款。 德国医疗协会的负责人富兰克·蒙哥马利说，患者隐私应该受到保护，这是宪法规定的基本权利。 对于遣返问题，马斯•德迈齐埃说，不会容忍利用假身份滞留德国的外国罪犯。 德国巴伐利亚情报部门的负责人对BBC记者说，德国遭受主要恐怖袭击的可能性很大。 他说，他们的特工正在调查数百件关于所谓“伊斯兰国”组织派遣人员伪装成难民进入德国的情报。 到目前为止，德国还没有遇到像法国发生的那样的大规模暴力攻击。去年在巴黎，伊斯兰激进主义者杀死147人，上月在尼斯85人死于暴力攻击。
"Ralls Corp, a private Chinese firm, had acquired four wind farm projects near a US naval facility earlier this year. This is the first foreign investment to be blocked in the US for 22 years. It comes as the US lodged a trade dispute against China just weeks ahead of November's presidential election. The move forces Ralls Corp to divest its stake in the projects, which were located near restricted airspace used by the military base. The president's order came after an investigation into the wind farms by the US Committee on Foreign Investments (CFIUS) said there was no way to mitigate the national security risks posed by the Chinese company's plans. The White House order said: ""There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Ralls Corporation... might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States."" The order also targeted Sany Group, the company that makes the turbine generators. The military has said it uses the Oregon base to test unmanned drones and other equipment for electronic warfare. The aircraft fly as low as 200ft (60m) at speeds of as much as 300mph (500km/h). Correspondents say the development could disgruntle China, whose trade advantage over the US has become a focus of Mr Obama's battle for re-election against Republican contender Mitt Romney. Mr Romney has repeatedly accused the president of being too lenient with what he has called China's unfair trade practices. Earlier this week, the Romney campaign released a video claiming that China is stealing American ideas and jobs, and accusing Mr Obama of doing little to stop it. Mr Romney has said that on his first day in office he would use an executive order to label Beijing a currency manipulator. The Obama campaign has in turn claimed that Mr Romney outsourced jobs to China during his time as a private equity chief. Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, Mr Obama has highlighted his record with China, reminding voters that he filed more trade cases against Beijing in one administration than his predecessor, George W Bush, did in two terms. This month, the Obama administration filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against Chinese subsidies for its car industry. The Obama campaign has also criticised Mr Romney for investing in Chinese firms.",美国总统奥巴马发出行政命令，以威胁国家安全为由，禁止中国三一重工在美国兴建数个风电场。,Ralls Corp.是三一集团掌控的美国公司，但是一直受到美国政府的怀疑。 三一集团在美国的子公司—Ralls Corp.原定在俄勒冈州兴建大约4个风能发电电场。 白宫在针对该公司发出的行政命令中，禁止包括经理人员、员工、所有人等该公司的代理人或者代表人进入原定兴建地点。 命令称有可信的证据令白宫相信三一集团及Ralls Corp.会采取对美国国家安全造成威胁或者不利的行动。 据了解，Ralls Corp.兴建风能电场的地点都是在当地美国海军武器训练设施的限制空域范围之内。 先前美国的外资审查委员会以可能危及国家安全为由下令Ralls Corp.停止兴建工程，而一般也很少见需要美国总统出面下令禁止外资购买美国企业或者机票乃至外资投资特定项目。 前一次类似的情况是老布什总统在任期间，于1990年下令禁止中国资金购买美国的一家航空科技厂商。 在美国外资审查委员会发出禁令之后，Ralls Corp.曾经在本月初聘用小布什政府时期担任司法高官的克莱门特等人作为法律顾问，就外资审查委员会的决定提出诉讼。 在外资审查委员会同意让Ralls Corp.有条件暂时复工之后，该公司收回了诉讼。 虽然在命令中，白宫并未详细说明会如何危及美国国家安全，但是美国的媒体报道说，这个俄勒冈州的海军武器训练基地是训练和测试美国海军电子作战飞机的主要场所。 与内文相关的链接
"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The government wants the UK to become a world leader in driverless technology. It will publish a code of practice in the spring which will allow the testing of autonomous cars to go ahead. Self-drive pods that will be tested in Milton Keynes and Coventry have been unveiled for the first time. The government promised a full review of current legislation by the summer of 2017. That review will involve a rewrite of the Highway Code and adjustments to MOT test guidelines, potentially taking into account whether a higher standard of driving should be demanded of automated vehicles. It will also look at who would be responsible in the event of a collision and how to ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians. The Department of Transport report acknowledged that true driverless cars may be some way off and that current tests of the technology will need to include a qualified test driver to supervise the vehicle. ""Driverless vehicle technology has the potential to be a real game-change on the UK's roads, altering the face of motoring in the most fundamental of ways and delivering major benefits for road safety, social inclusion, emissions and congestion,"" said transport minister Claire Perry. The government is providing £19m to launch four driverless car schemes in four UK locations. To mark the launch of the review, Ms Perry and Business Secretary Vince Cable highlighted some of the trials that they are funding, including a fully autonomous shuttle in Greenwich and a BAE System-developed Wildcat vehicle, which will be tested in Bristol. Self-drive pods that will be tested in Milton Keynes and Coventry were also unveiled for the first time. Prof Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ""These trials are not just about harnessing technology to make our travelling lives easier and safer, they also involve getting the regulation right. ""Alongside the hi-tech innovation you need policy decisions on long-term, low-tech matters such as who takes responsibility if things go wrong. As and when these vehicles become commonplace, there is likely to be a shift from personal to product liability and that is a whole new ball game for insurers and manufacturers."" But the Institute of the Motor Industry (IMI) said that it was concerned that, while the government is pushing ahead with making driverless cars a reality, the service and repair sector did not yet have the skills and infrastructure in place to deal with the new technology. IMI chief executive Steve Nash is calling on businesses to take steps to address this sooner rather than later. ""We believe the government is yet to fully [realise] the pressures we are under,"" he said. Driverless cars around the world Smartphone app The Lutz Pathfinder pod, which is being led by the UK's Future Transport Systems innovation centre, will be tested on the pavements of Milton Keynes later this year. It is a two-seater, electric-powered vehicle that is packed with 19 sensors, cameras, radar and Lidar - a remote sensing technology that measures distance by illuminating a target with a laser and analysing the reflected light. In a panel behind the seat is the computing power equivalent to two high-end gaming computers. Three pods will drive themselves on the pavements and pedestrianised areas of the city initially and, if successful, a fleet of 40 vehicles will be rolled out. These vehicles will be able to talk to each other as well as being connected to a smartphone app to allow people to hail them. Alongside the trials in Milton Keynes and Coventry, Bristol will host the Venturer consortium, which aims to investigate whether driverless cars can reduce congestion and make roads safer. Its members include the insurance group Axa, and much of its focus will be on the public's reaction to the technology as well as the legal and insurance implications of its introduction. Greenwich is set to run the Gateway scheme. This will be led by the Transport Research Laboratory consultancy and also involves General Motors, as well as the AA and RAC motoring associations. It plans to carry out tests of automated passenger shuttle vehicles as well as autonomous valet parking for adapted cars. In addition, a self-drive car simulator will make use of a photorealistic 3D model of the area to study how people react to sharing the driving of a vehicle with a computer. Research undertaken by Virgin last year suggested that 43% of the British public wouldn't feel comfortable with the presence of driverless cars on the roads. A quarter of those surveyed said that they would not get inside such a car.",英国交通部的一份报告确认说，有必要修改现行的交通规则和汽车维修检查规定，以便无人驾驶汽车在英国上路行驶。,政府希望英国能够领衔世界无人驾驶汽车技术。 政府希望英国能够领衔世界无人驾驶汽车技术。 英国政府将在今年春季公布新的规则，批准自动驾驶汽车的测试。 英国的米尔顿·凯恩斯和考文垂都推出了将上路测试的自动驾驶汽车模型。 政府承诺将在2017年夏季之前全面评估现行的交通法律法规。 这将包括重新修订交通规则，修改汽车路检（MOT）测试规定，有可能对自动驾驶汽车提出更严格的驾驶标准。 它也将考虑撞车时的责任问题，以及如何确保司机和行人的安全。 英国交通部的报告承认，真正意义上的无人驾驶汽车上路还要相当一段时间，目前的测试阶段还需要一名合格的测试司机来监督汽车行驶情况。 英国交通部长克莱尔·佩里说“无人驾驶汽车技术有让英国道路改头换面地潜力，它将彻底改变汽车驾驶，让道路更安全，社会更包容，大幅减少排放和路面拥堵。” 英国政府出资1900万英镑在4个城镇推出无人驾驶汽车计划。 （编译：立行 /责编：李莉）
"Clarkson has apologised and asked for forgiveness after a clip of him reciting the nursery rhyme Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe was published by the Mirror. Although he mumbles the offending word, the presenter clearly begins by saying the letter ""n"". Responding to the row, the BBC issued a strongly-worded statement. ""Jeremy Clarkson has set out the background to this regrettable episode. We have made it absolutely clear to him the standards the BBC expects on air and off. ""We have left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this."" Clarkson initially denied using the racist term, telling his 3.3 million Twitter followers: ""I did not use the N-word. Never use it. The Mirror has gone way too far this time."" But the newspaper responded by posting a clip of the incident - which was filmed in 2012 and never broadcast. On Thursday night, Clarkson released a video statement ""begging forgiveness"" for the error. This time, he admitted he had appeared to ""mumble"" the offensive word despite attempting not to. ""I was mortified by this, horrified. It was a word I loathe."" ""I did everything in my power to ensure that that word did not get in the programme that was transmitted."" Editor of The Voice newspaper George Ruddock said that, if it was clear Clarkson had used the offensive term, ""the BBC should take some action"". ""If you were in a normal workplace and that was used, it would certainly call for disciplinary action,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. ""How often is he going to keep apologising for these things?"" Labour MP Jim Sheridan, who sits on Parliament's culture, media and sport committee, also noted this was not Clarkson's first offence, and called for him to be sacked. He said: ""Already he's insulted nations, he's insulted disabled persons, he's insulted people with mental illness. Every time he apologises, and every time the BBC say that they've told him to cut it out, and he's not doing it."" ""His whole career is littered with apologies, and I doubt very much if indeed he is sorry."" Downing Street condemned any use of the word, saying that David Cameron - a friend of Clarkson's - would ""certainly not"" use it. The prime minister felt it was ""absolutely right that there has been an apology,"" his spokesman said. But he refused to comment on whether Clarkson should lose his job, saying: ""His view is that in terms of actions and the like, that's for the BBC"". Former BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland also rebutted calls for Clarkson to be sacked, despite acknowledging ""a serious error of judgment"". ""He shouldn't be sacked. I tell you who should be sacked, and that's the person who released the clip to the Daily Mirror in order to give the whole thing a wider circulation than it deserved"". ""It's a word that wasn't broadcast. He's apologised and, really, that should be the end of the matter"". ""Do you think he's a racist? I suspect not. I think he's sloppy in his use of language."" Production notes On Friday, Clarkson spoke to The Sun, where he writes a column, and attempted to explain the incident. ""I wish to God my attempts to cover up that word were better,"" he said. ""I was simply mumbling - saying 'ner ner' or something similar. Anything but the n-word. ""It was my mistake and I apologise for not covering it up. But if you look closely at the footage, you can see what I'm trying to do."" He also showed the newspaper production notes for the Top Gear episode, in which he attempted to have the offensive word removed. The 54-year-old told producers: ""I didn't use the N-word here but I've just listened through my headphones and it sounds like I did. ""Is there another take?"" Although the clip was never broadcast on the BBC Two show, the corporation said it had received more than 300 complaints following recent media coverage. Previous incidents It is not the first time the Top Gear presenter has been accused of racism. The BBC apologised in 2011, after an episode in which co-presenter Richard Hammond called Mexicans ""feckless [and] flatulent"" and Clarkson joked they would not receive complaints because the Mexican ambassador would be asleep. Apologies were also made for an episode broadcast in March, in which Clarkson used the word ""slope"" as an Asian man crossed a newly built bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand. The use of the word - which is a derogatory term for people of Asian descent - led to complaints and the threat of legal action from Equal Justice, a law firm specialising in discrimination cases.",英国广播公司BBC汽车节目Top Gear主持人之一杰罗米·克拉克森（Jeremy Clarkson）否认自己在其中一集节目中使用了种族歧视的字眼。,克拉克森经常发表一些引起争议的评论 《每日镜报》报道，这位主持人在节目中使用儿歌进行调侃时使用了带有种族歧视的字眼，不过之后在BBC播出的节目中这个词被编辑删除。 克拉克森在推特上发表了一份视频做出了回应，他说自己厌恶这个词。 他在视频中表示，对于听起来有些像歧视的词语，自己感到“震惊”并且指出，对于听起来很像，自己“请求谅解”。 在早些时候的推特中，他指出，“我没有使用这个词，从来没有用过，《镜报》这次过分了。” BBC发表声明指出，“克拉克森对这期节目的背景做出了解释，我们非常清楚地告知他BBC在镜头前和镜头后的要求。他非常清楚我们对这个情况多么重视。” Top Gear节目的另外一名主持人詹姆斯·梅在推特上为克拉克森做出了辩护，他指出，“克拉克森不是种族歧视者。我也不会和种族歧视者一起共事。” 就在几天之前，Top Gear节目的制作人对于克拉克森在泰国和缅甸的节目中的一个玩笑话略带有一点歧视味道而做出了道歉。 克拉克森经常会发表一些引起争议的评论。他曾经在接受采访时说，罢工工人应该被枪毙。而且他也表示那些卧轨自杀的人是自私之举。 另外克拉克森在印度和墨西哥两期节目中的评论也引起很多人的投诉。 (撰稿：林杉 / 责编：郱书）
"Heavy overnight snow in some parts of the country led to wintry conditions for voters, particularly in the Highlands. A record number of people have already cast their ballots - with more than a million having registered to vote by post. Votes will not be counted overnight after the election because of Covid. Instead, counting will start on Friday morning, with the final result expected on Saturday. Scotland's party leaders all turned out at polling stations on Thursday morning. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, who had already voted by post, was in Glasgow, which was where Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar and Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie cast their votes. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross was at Alves Hall in Moray, while Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie - who had also voted by post - was at Strathpeffer Community Centre near Dingwall. The election is seen as being crucial to the future of the UK as the result could impact on whether or not there is a second referendum on Scottish independence. But it will also decide who forms the next Scottish government, which has considerable powers over areas such as health, education and income tax. The pandemic means polling stations will feel different to normal - with voters being expected to wear face coverings and use hand sanitiser when they arrive. The Electoral Commission has also recommended that voters bring their own pen or pencil to fill out their ballot papers - although clean pencils will also be available for use. Physical distancing measures will be in place and there may be a one-way system in operation, depending on your polling place. The Electoral Commission has also warned voters that they may have to queue to enter the building as there will be a limit on the number of voters allowed inside at any one time. Anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 or who is in self-isolation will be able to apply for a proxy vote up until 17:00 on polling day. How do I vote in the election? Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election and have not been legally excluded from voting (for example because they are serving a prison sentence of longer than 12 months). People have two votes - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 Constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party.

"By Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News, Venice The protest formed quickly and without warning - a flash mob, designed to call urgent attention to the 6,000 Venetians who rely on the cruise industry for work. After 15 minutes they are gone. This year, international travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus are forcing cruise companies to delay most tours until 2021. That's meant the ships that usually tower high above Venice's historic bell towers and basilicas have been noticeably absent. Environmental campaigners have welcomed the change. They've been calling for cruise ships to be banned from Venice for years because of concerns about pollution and continual damage to the fragile foundations of the city. Traditionally known as La Serenissima, Venice is no longer ""'the most serene"" but rather one of the most polluted ports in Europe, according to the green campaign group Transport and Environment. Supporters of the cruise industry say the Italian government in Rome must now come up with a long-term plan - such as a new cruise terminal, outside the Venice lagoon - that will protect the city, but also guarantee the ships' future in the area. Antonio Valecca is a porter with the baggage company Portabagagli del Porto di Venezia, which has been transporting tourists' luggage from ships to Venice's hotels for the past 80 years. ""When the coronavirus is finished, we need to bring the cruise ships back to Venice,"" he says. ""This is the moment for the government to make a decision."" Because of the continuing debate, the world's second-largest cruise firm, Royal Caribbean, has already announced that next summer, its cruise liners won't be calling at Venice. Instead, they will be docking at Ravenna, 150km (90 miles) to the south. Passengers who want to visit Venice will be taken there on buses. The protesters say other cruise ships could be permanently diverted to ports at Genoa or Trieste. ""We're really worried about that,"" Mr Valecca says. Baggage handler Vladimiro Tommasini who led the recent protest says the workers he represents are tired of waiting for the government to act. ""We are here today to protest because we've been waiting eight years for a solution regarding the passage of cruise ships in Venice,"" he says. ""We ask that cruise tourism has to be compatible with the structure of our city and the lagoon. We now ask for answers from the government."" Eight years ago, 33 people died when an Italian cruise ship, the Costa Concordia, capsized and sank off the coast of Tuscany after hitting an underwater reef. The accident prompted the Italian authorities to introduce a law banning the largest cruise liners from Venice - those over 96,000 tonnes. Smaller vessels were limited to five ships per day. But the law was thrown out soon after at appeal. Matters came to a head again last summer, when the 60,000-tonne MSC Opera lost control and crashed into a dock and a tourist boat in Venice, injuring two passengers. Mobile phone footage of the incident shows the ship's horn blaring as bystanders dwarfed by the 13-deck vessel shout ""Get back!"" and run from the incoming hull. But despite mounting pressure, city authorities and the national government in Rome have failed to come up with a plan for the ships' future, and Venice remains divided. Opponents of the cruise industry say the pandemic has shown what the future could look like, if the cruise liners were banned for good. On the same day as the port workers' protest on the train station steps, a climate camp is being held in a disused industrial site in Marghera, about 20 minutes' drive across the bridge from Venice. Banners calling for an end to fossil fuels have been hung on the walls of a large warehouse where young people are listening to speakers making rallying calls for climate justice. Flags painted with ""no grandi navi"" (no big ships) fly outside the camp. Environmental activist Sofia Demasi is part of the No Grandi Navi committee and the international climate movement, Fridays For Future. ""Big cruise ships create a lot of pollution, a lot of problems for a city that should not be an example of the climate crisis, but of the fight against the crisis,"" she says. No Grandi Navi leader Tommaso Cacciari says that as well as the pollution, the ships are damaging the city's foundations, by creating underwater waves that cause erosion. ""The stones of Venice are not concrete, they are not kept together by cement. It's kept together by mud and sand, materials that are very mobile,"" he says. ""And so it causes erosion of the structure of the city. And that's a big problem."" But the environmentalists face a tough campaign against a cruise industry with powerful political allies. Italy is home to one of the world's largest shipbuilding firms, Fincantieri. Last month, the company delivered the latest member of its fleet - a 145,000 tonne mega-ship called the Enchanted Princess, ordered by the Carnival Corporation, the world's largest cruise firm. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte sent his congratulations in a video message. Carnival Corporation CEO Arnold Donald joined the ceremony by video link from Florida. ""We are facing extremely challenging times within our industry,"" he told the socially-distanced crowd at Fincantieri's Monfalcone shipyard. ""We thank you prime minister and your government for your ongoing support."" Mr Donald said Carnival Corporation had been one of the largest foreign investors in the Italian economy, pointing to the €30bn ($35bn; £27bn) that Carnival has spent on Fincantieri ships over the past 30 years. ""Gathering here today helps us to focus on the joy that sailing the oceans brings to millions of guests each year,"" he said. ""It also reminds us of the vast numbers of people whose careers and livelihoods depend on the maritime industry."" It is not yet clear who will win the argument over the future of cruise ships in Venice, but the pressure is mounting on the authorities to reach a decision.

Additional reporting by Vera Mantengoli",“工作！工作！工作！”在威尼斯市圣露西亚中央火车站的台阶上，正在示威的行李管理员、轮船清洁工以及码头保安人员这样喊着。,这场示威组织得很快，没有任何警告就发生了——一批“快闪族”有计划地迅速为依赖邮轮产业获得就业的6000名威尼斯人获取关注。15分钟后，他们就散了。 今年，因新型冠状病毒疫情造成的国际旅游限制正在迫使各家公司将大部分旅行团延迟到2021年。 这意味着，平常停泊在威尼斯历史悠久的钟楼和教堂后面的那些巨大轮船，这段时间都看不见了。 环保倡议人士对这种转变表示欢迎。他们多年来一直在呼吁威尼斯禁止邮轮业务，以减少污染以及对这座城市原本已经脆弱的基础产业的破坏。 作为传统上被形容为“La Serenissima（最祥和的）”的城市，威尼斯现已不再是“最祥和”的地方；据绿色倡议组织运输环境联合会（Transport and Environment）所指，它现在更像是欧洲污染最严重的港口。 邮轮产业的支持者称，罗马的意大利政府现在必须制订长远的计划——比如在威尼斯泻湖之外设立一个新的停泊站，这样即可以保护城市，也能保证这个区域邮轮产业的未来。 邮轮产业工作者呼吁政府立即就威尼斯港口的未来作出决策。 安东尼奥·瓦莱卡（Antonio Valecca）是行李寄存公司威尼斯港口行李（Portabagagli del Porto di Venezia）的一名看门人。这家公司在过去80年来一直服务游客，将他们的行李从船上送到威尼斯的酒店。 “等新冠疫情结束的时候，我们需要将邮轮带回威尼斯，”他说，“这是政府要做决定的时刻。” 由于这场持续的辩论，世界第二大邮轮企业皇家加勒比国际邮轮（Royal Caribbean）已经宣布，他们明年夏天的邮轮不会前往威尼斯。 邮轮会转而停靠在南面150公里（90英里）的拉文纳港（Ravenna）。想前往威尼斯的乘客将要从那里乘坐巴士。 示威者表示，邮轮可能会永久地转移到热那亚或者的里雅斯特（Trieste）的港口。 “我们实在是很担心这个，”瓦莱卡说。 威尼斯一家书店挂着“不要大船”的旗子。 领导最近这次示威的行李管理员弗拉迪米罗·托马西尼（Vladimiro Tommasini）表示，他所代表的工人已经厌倦了等待政府行动。 “我们今天来到这里抗议，是因为我们已经为威尼斯邮轮业前景的解决办法等待了八年，”他说。 “我们要求邮轮旅游业必须和我们城市以及泻湖的结构相适应，我们现在要求政府给予答案。” 八年前，一艘意大利邮轮歌诗达协和号（Costa Concordia）在发生触礁事故后，于托斯卡纳海岸倾侧并沉没，33人死亡。 该事故促使意大利当局引入新法案，禁止来自威尼斯的最大邮轮（9.6万吨以上）行驶，较小的船型则被限制在每天五班，但是法案在上诉之后不久又被废除。 去年夏天，这一问题的冲突再次出现。6吨的歌剧号（MSC Opera）邮轮失控，撞进了威尼斯一个码头并撞到一只游艇，两名乘客受伤。 拍下该起事故的手机影片显示，船的号角正在吹响的同时，路人在喊着“退后！”并跑着躲开冲过来的这艘高13层的船。 但是尽管压力越来越大，城市当局以及罗马的全国政府仍然未能为邮轮业的未来制订计划，而威尼斯当地的意见则仍然两极。 邮轮业的反对者称，全球大流行疫情已经显示了，如果邮轮被永久禁止的话，未来可以是什么样子的。 港口工人在火车站台阶抗议的同一天，从威尼斯过桥20分钟车程之外的马格拉，一个废弃的工业地带正在举办一个气候活动营。 威尼斯市内的一些墙壁上，近日贴上了海报，声称新冠疫情与邮轮有关。 呼吁结束使用化石燃料的横幅挂在一个大仓库的墙上，年轻人在那里听演讲者大声呼吁气候正义。 写着“no gradi navi（不要大船）”的旗帜在营外飘扬。 环保活动人士索菲娅·德马西（Sofia Demasi）是“No Grandi Navi”委员会的成员，也是国际气候运动组织“星期五为未来”（Fridays For Future）的一员。 “大邮轮给一个城市造成大量污染，大量的问题，这个城市不应该是气候危机的一个样本，而应该是对抗危机的榜样，”她说。 “No Grandi Navi”的领头人托马索·卡奇亚里（Tommaso Cacciari）说，除了污染，这些船还在破坏这个城市的基石——它造成水下波，会形成侵蚀。 “威尼斯的石头不是混凝土，它们不是用水泥黏合的。它是用泥和水固定在一起的，这些物质非常容易流动，”他说。 “所以这会造成城市地质结构被侵蚀，这是一个大问题。” 环保活动人士索菲娅·德马西：“没有邮轮的威尼斯是一个不一样的地方，而我们很快乐。” 但是，环保人士面对的是与当权者有政治联系的邮轮产业，这是一个困难重重的倡议运动。意大利也有世界上最大的造船企业芬坎蒂尼集团（Fincantieri）。 上月，该公司推出了一款最新的船型——14.5万吨的巨型船，叫做“奇缘公主号”（Enchanted Princess），那是世界最大的游轮公司嘉年华邮轮公司（Carnival Corporation）订造的船。 意大利总理朱塞佩·孔特（Giuseppe Conte）通过视频讯息发出了祝贺。 嘉年华邮轮公司的首席执行官阿诺德·唐纳德（Arnold Donald）则从佛罗里达州通过视像连线参加了仪式。 “我们正在面对我们这个行业内极端困难的时期，”他在芬坎蒂尼集团在蒙法尔科内的船厂内向守着社交距离的人群说。 “我们感谢您，总理，还有您的政府持续的支持。” 嘉年华邮轮公司14.5万吨重的奇缘公主号，近日由意大利造船企业芬坎蒂尼公司交付。 唐纳德表示，嘉年华邮轮公司是意大利经济当中最大的外国投资者之一，指出在过去30年，嘉年华公司在芬坎蒂尼生产的船上投资了300亿欧元（350亿美元；270亿英镑）。 “今天齐聚这里，让我们可以好好地感受这种快乐，海上航行每年带来数以百万计的客人，”他说。 “这也提醒了我们，有大量的人职业和生计都依靠海事产业。” 如今尚不清楚谁将会在这场有关威尼斯邮轮业未来的辩论中取胜，但是要求当局作出决定的压力正在累积。 今年，能够来到威尼斯的访客，有机会看到这个城市在邮轮到来之前原本的样子。 “如果你现在在运河附近漫步，你会看到差别。没有邮轮，威尼斯就是一个不一样的地方，而我们很快乐，”索菲娅·德马西说。 *维拉·曼登戈利（Vera Mantengoli）参与报道。
"Nick RobinsonPolitical editor Few can doubt it now. It is over 100 years since a national election has been won by a party other than the Conservatives and Labour. What's more the UK Independence Party did it by winning seats not just in every region of England but in Wales and Scotland too. The impact of the result will be immediate. David Cameron will face pressure to harden up his promise to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU and to reduce immigration to win back the many Tory voters lost to UKIP. Ed Miliband will face an inquest into why before the votes of Londoners were counted Labour were only neck and neck with the Tories. And Nick Clegg will face demands to explain what can save his party if it is not a change of leadership. Alex Salmond will have to confront the fact that he failed in his aim of ensuring that Scotland was a UKIP-free zone. However, he'll use the result to urge Scots to break free from the anti European forces which topped the poll in England. Only Nigel Farage can be totally satisfied today although he knows all too well that winning a national election which he described as a ""free hit"" on the political establishment is much easier than winning a single seat in Westminster. A year ago few took that prospect seriously. They do now.",一场政坛地震？在英格兰地方选举结果揭晓后，还有些人不太相信这个说法。,英国独立党领袖法拉吉对选举结果感到完全满意。 但是，在英国全国的欧洲议会选举结果出炉之后，没有人能继续怀疑，英国政坛确已发生“地震”。 一个除保守党和工党之外的政党在一场全国性选举中获胜，这是一个世纪以来的第一次。 而且，英国独立党不仅在英格兰的每一个地区都赢得地方议会席位，而且在威尔士和苏格兰也有斩获。 这次选举的影响马上就会浮现。 因为很多保守党支持者此次转投独立党，保守党籍的英国首相卡梅伦将面临更大的压力，履行减少移民数量和就英国与欧盟的关系重新展开谈判的承诺。 工党的表现也大大落后于预期。许多党员质问工党领导人米利班德，为什么工党未能在伦敦以外地区超越保守党，而只能与其并驾齐驱？ 身为联合政府副首相的自由民主党党魁尼克·克莱格处境更为艰难，党内已经有要他下台的呼声。他将不得不说明，如果不换党魁，他有什么办法可以拯救自由民主党。 追求苏格兰独立的苏格兰首席部长萨蒙德也不好受。他此次选举的目标是力阻英国独立党打进苏格兰政坛，但是没有实现。不过，萨蒙德会利用这次的选举结果，呼吁苏格兰人选择独立，以脱离反欧盟势力甚嚣尘上的英格兰。 只有英国独立党领导人法拉吉会对选举结果感到完全满意。但他一定明白，赢得地方和欧洲议会选举和赢得英国议会席位不是一回事，后者要艰难得多。 一年以前，没有几个人相信英国独立党有可能赢得威斯敏斯特议会的议席。但现在，人们不得不认真考虑这个可能性了。 （编译：秦川 责编：尚清）
"The hugely oversubscribed sale was priced at 330p a share, valuing the 500-year-old firm at £3.3bn. At one point, the price hit 459.75p. Private investors received 227 shares each. In all, more than 225 million shares were traded on Friday. Business Secretary Vince Cable told Channel Four News he could have charged a higher price for Royal Mail shares. Asked if he could have raised the sale price when he saw the level of demand for shares, Mr Cable said: ""I could have done and I could have joined the speculators and spivs. ""I'm not interested in doing that,"" he said. The shares are listed officially next Tuesday, but City institutions began conditional dealings on Friday. Some 10 million shares were traded in the first 30 seconds when the market opened. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown reported that its website was having ""intermittent problems"" due to the ""unprecedented interest"" in Royal Mail. Tom McPhail, the firm's head of pensions research, said it was ""extremely sorry for the delays"", but was making ""significant progress in clearing the backlog"" and hoped to have all systems running normally again soon. ""We have experienced demand this morning which has gone off the scale,"" he said. ""We now have six times the normal number of staff working on our dealing lines. We know we are not the only broker affected by such problems this morning."" The price rise is likely to fuel debate over whether the sale of Royal Mail has been undervalued. Mr Cable has insisted that the taxpayer has not been short-changed by the privatisation. But the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, Billy Hayes, described the sell-off as ""a tragedy"" and predicted that it would make ""not one scintilla of difference"" to employees' intention to vote for strike action next Wednesday. Mr Hayes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is a sham, really. The company has been undervalued. ""It's basically David Cameron rewarding his mates in the City. Vince Cable, one of the cleverest men in British politics, has made one of the stupidest decisions he is ever likely to make as a politician."" 'Froth and speculation' Mr Cable told the Today programme that the bulk of the shares had gone to ""long-term stable investors"" in the UK. He said any volatility in the Royal Mail share price over the next week or so was of little consequence. ""What matters is where the price eventually settles in three or six months' time"". Mr Cable said: ""You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO [initial public offering] of this kind. ""The bulk of the shares have gone to long-term institutional investors, stable investors, some overseas investors, but mainly British pension funds and insurance companies who are there for the long term. ""The objective of the exercise, which fits in with what we want for the Royal Mail, is to make sure it has stable, long-term investors."" Voting in the strike ballot will close on 16 October. Under the current rules on industrial action, the earliest possible date for a strike is 23 October. In the flotation prospectus, Royal Mail warned that labour unrest posed a potential risk for the share price. Mr Cable said a strike was not in the interests of Royal Mail. 'Dazzling debut' City analysts said the price rise was driven by big institutional investors' demand for the stock. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, said investment funds were ""queuing up to make big purchases"". Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, called the surge in Royal Mail shares a ""dazzling stock market debut"". But he said factors such as the threat of industrial action, a lack of adequate capital and unclear growth strategy could weigh down the stock price in the future.",英国皇家邮政股票周五开始有条件交易，股价一度达到每股456便士。这比招股价330便士高出38%。,尽管工会威胁举行大罢工，但绝大部分皇家邮政的员工还是决定接受公司的股份。 上市的30秒钟内，就有1000万股成交。 股票上市一小时后，股价稍微回落至444便士。 因私人投资者认购需求非常旺盛，英国皇家邮政削减了机构投资者的认购配额，资金量较大的个人投资者的认购额也被削减。 下周二，皇家邮政股票将正式开始在伦敦证券交易所交易。 首日有条件交易皇家邮政股价大涨预计会进一步引发皇家邮政是否被低估的争论。 皇家邮政上市是英国政府在过去20年来最大规模的私有化行动。 英国政府希望透过私有化来集资推动邮政现代化，改善皇家邮政的竞争力。 历史悠久 皇家邮政于1516年由英王亨利八世创立，1969年由中央政府改组成国有企业。 皇家邮政私有化计划已讨论多时，2009年因环球金融危机导致英国经济不景气，被工党政府喊停。保守党—自民党联合政府三年前重启计划。 虽然英国政府已在2006年开放邮政业，结束皇家邮政维持了350年的垄断地位，但其市场份额仍然最大。 市场人士指出，皇家邮政招股将是继1980年代保守党首相撒切尔夫人主政期间的国企上市浪潮以来，英国最大的一次私有化活动。 不过，皇家邮政旗下的邮局已在去年分拆成为英国邮局有限公司（Post Office Ltd），并将维持其国企身份，不会跟随皇家邮政私有化。 编译/责编：李莉
"By Reality Check teamBBC News They make up one-third of the total international body in the US and pay significant sums to study at top institutions. However, there is growing pressure in the US to place restrictions on foreign students, particularly Chinese, amid tensions between the two countries over a range of issues, most prominently trade. China has suggested students travelling to the United States may face heightened risks. Rising tensions The US government has been targeting specific groups of students or academics who they feel pose national security risks or are involved in alleged intellectual property theft. Last year, the US State Department shortened visas for Chinese students studying some courses, over fears of spying and intellectual property theft. Republican members of Congress are also introducing legislation to ban anyone sponsored or employed by the Chinese military from receiving student or research visas. For its part, China last week issued an unprecedented warning to its students and academics, urging them to ""raise their risk assessment"" following an increase in delays and visa rejections for study in the US. Analysts suggest China wants to discourage students from studying in the US to increase pressure, as part of the growing trade war. The rejection rate of students seeking to study in the US this year on Chinese government scholarships was 13.5% in the first quarter of 2019, according to official Chinese statistics. That compares with 3.2% in 2018. It's a significant rise, but covers only a fraction of the total number of Chinese students who go to America. Over the past decade the number of Chinese students enrolled in US colleges has more than trebled. In the 2017-18 academic year, there were 360,000 Chinese students enrolled in the US to take up courses. This has made them an important source of revenue for American academic institutions. On the whole, most private universities will not charge extra for international students, but there might be added fees for administrative costs. At public universities run by state governments, foreign students will typically pay the same as American students who are from out of state. Overall, international students contributed 28% of all tuition fees to public universities in 2015, according to Deserve, a company providing financial services to students. And with around one-third of these foreign students coming from China, that's a sizeable proportion of revenue generated from this source. The amount Chinese students and their families contribute to the US economy continues to rise. This is estimated to have been $13 billion in 2017-2018, a figure that includes tuition fees and living expenses, according to NAFSA: Association of International Educators. Studying in the US remains a highly attractive option for Chinese students. ""There is a perception among Chinese parents that the education system isn't as good as elsewhere"", says Mary Gallagher, director at the Lieberthal-Rogel Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan. By way of comparison, the number of American students travelling to China to study is small, with just under 12,000 enrolling in 2017-2018.

"By Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News, Venice The protest formed quickly and without warning - a flash mob, designed to call urgent attention to the 6,000 Venetians who rely on the cruise industry for work. After 15 minutes they are gone. This year, international travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus are forcing cruise companies to delay most tours until 2021. That's meant the ships that usually tower high above Venice's historic bell towers and basilicas have been noticeably absent. Environmental campaigners have welcomed the change. They've been calling for cruise ships to be banned from Venice for years because of concerns about pollution and continual damage to the fragile foundations of the city. Traditionally known as La Serenissima, Venice is no longer ""'the most serene"" but rather one of the most polluted ports in Europe, according to the green campaign group Transport and Environment. Supporters of the cruise industry say the Italian government in Rome must now come up with a long-term plan - such as a new cruise terminal, outside the Venice lagoon - that will protect the city, but also guarantee the ships' future in the area. Antonio Valecca is a porter with the baggage company Portabagagli del Porto di Venezia, which has been transporting tourists' luggage from ships to Venice's hotels for the past 80 years. ""When the coronavirus is finished, we need to bring the cruise ships back to Venice,"" he says. ""This is the moment for the government to make a decision."" Because of the continuing debate, the world's second-largest cruise firm, Royal Caribbean, has already announced that next summer, its cruise liners won't be calling at Venice. Instead, they will be docking at Ravenna, 150km (90 miles) to the south. Passengers who want to visit Venice will be taken there on buses. The protesters say other cruise ships could be permanently diverted to ports at Genoa or Trieste. ""We're really worried about that,"" Mr Valecca says. Baggage handler Vladimiro Tommasini who led the recent protest says the workers he represents are tired of waiting for the government to act. ""We are here today to protest because we've been waiting eight years for a solution regarding the passage of cruise ships in Venice,"" he says. ""We ask that cruise tourism has to be compatible with the structure of our city and the lagoon. We now ask for answers from the government."" Eight years ago, 33 people died when an Italian cruise ship, the Costa Concordia, capsized and sank off the coast of Tuscany after hitting an underwater reef. The accident prompted the Italian authorities to introduce a law banning the largest cruise liners from Venice - those over 96,000 tonnes. Smaller vessels were limited to five ships per day. But the law was thrown out soon after at appeal. Matters came to a head again last summer, when the 60,000-tonne MSC Opera lost control and crashed into a dock and a tourist boat in Venice, injuring two passengers. Mobile phone footage of the incident shows the ship's horn blaring as bystanders dwarfed by the 13-deck vessel shout ""Get back!"" and run from the incoming hull. But despite mounting pressure, city authorities and the national government in Rome have failed to come up with a plan for the ships' future, and Venice remains divided. Opponents of the cruise industry say the pandemic has shown what the future could look like, if the cruise liners were banned for good. On the same day as the port workers' protest on the train station steps, a climate camp is being held in a disused industrial site in Marghera, about 20 minutes' drive across the bridge from Venice. Banners calling for an end to fossil fuels have been hung on the walls of a large warehouse where young people are listening to speakers making rallying calls for climate justice. Flags painted with ""no grandi navi"" (no big ships) fly outside the camp. Environmental activist Sofia Demasi is part of the No Grandi Navi committee and the international climate movement, Fridays For Future. ""Big cruise ships create a lot of pollution, a lot of problems for a city that should not be an example of the climate crisis, but of the fight against the crisis,"" she says. No Grandi Navi leader Tommaso Cacciari says that as well as the pollution, the ships are damaging the city's foundations, by creating underwater waves that cause erosion. ""The stones of Venice are not concrete, they are not kept together by cement. It's kept together by mud and sand, materials that are very mobile,"" he says. ""And so it causes erosion of the structure of the city. And that's a big problem."" But the environmentalists face a tough campaign against a cruise industry with powerful political allies. Italy is home to one of the world's largest shipbuilding firms, Fincantieri. Last month, the company delivered the latest member of its fleet - a 145,000 tonne mega-ship called the Enchanted Princess, ordered by the Carnival Corporation, the world's largest cruise firm. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte sent his congratulations in a video message. Carnival Corporation CEO Arnold Donald joined the ceremony by video link from Florida. ""We are facing extremely challenging times within our industry,"" he told the socially-distanced crowd at Fincantieri's Monfalcone shipyard. ""We thank you prime minister and your government for your ongoing support."" Mr Donald said Carnival Corporation had been one of the largest foreign investors in the Italian economy, pointing to the €30bn ($35bn; £27bn) that Carnival has spent on Fincantieri ships over the past 30 years. ""Gathering here today helps us to focus on the joy that sailing the oceans brings to millions of guests each year,"" he said. ""It also reminds us of the vast numbers of people whose careers and livelihoods depend on the maritime industry."" It is not yet clear who will win the argument over the future of cruise ships in Venice, but the pressure is mounting on the authorities to reach a decision. This year, visitors who do make it to Venice have the chance to see the city as it was, before the cruise ships came. ""If you walk near the canals now, you can see what the difference is. Without cruise ships, Venice is a different place and we're happy,"" says Sofia Demasi. Additional reporting by Vera Mantengoli",“工作！工作！工作！”在威尼斯市圣露西亚中央火车站的台阶上，正在示威的行李管理员、轮船清洁工以及码头保安人员这样喊着。,这场示威组织得很快，没有任何警告就发生了——一批“快闪族”有计划地迅速为依赖邮轮产业获得就业的6000名威尼斯人获取关注。15分钟后，他们就散了。 今年，因新型冠状病毒疫情造成的国际旅游限制正在迫使各家公司将大部分旅行团延迟到2021年。 这意味着，平常停泊在威尼斯历史悠久的钟楼和教堂后面的那些巨大轮船，这段时间都看不见了。 环保倡议人士对这种转变表示欢迎。他们多年来一直在呼吁威尼斯禁止邮轮业务，以减少污染以及对这座城市原本已经脆弱的基础产业的破坏。 作为传统上被形容为“La Serenissima（最祥和的）”的城市，威尼斯现已不再是“最祥和”的地方；据绿色倡议组织运输环境联合会（Transport and Environment）所指，它现在更像是欧洲污染最严重的港口。 邮轮产业的支持者称，罗马的意大利政府现在必须制订长远的计划——比如在威尼斯泻湖之外设立一个新的停泊站，这样即可以保护城市，也能保证这个区域邮轮产业的未来。 邮轮产业工作者呼吁政府立即就威尼斯港口的未来作出决策。 安东尼奥·瓦莱卡（Antonio Valecca）是行李寄存公司威尼斯港口行李（Portabagagli del Porto di Venezia）的一名看门人。这家公司在过去80年来一直服务游客，将他们的行李从船上送到威尼斯的酒店。 “等新冠疫情结束的时候，我们需要将邮轮带回威尼斯，”他说，“这是政府要做决定的时刻。” 由于这场持续的辩论，世界第二大邮轮企业皇家加勒比国际邮轮（Royal Caribbean）已经宣布，他们明年夏天的邮轮不会前往威尼斯。 邮轮会转而停靠在南面150公里（90英里）的拉文纳港（Ravenna）。想前往威尼斯的乘客将要从那里乘坐巴士。 示威者表示，邮轮可能会永久地转移到热那亚或者的里雅斯特（Trieste）的港口。 “我们实在是很担心这个，”瓦莱卡说。 威尼斯一家书店挂着“不要大船”的旗子。 领导最近这次示威的行李管理员弗拉迪米罗·托马西尼（Vladimiro Tommasini）表示，他所代表的工人已经厌倦了等待政府行动。 “我们今天来到这里抗议，是因为我们已经为威尼斯邮轮业前景的解决办法等待了八年，”他说。 “我们要求邮轮旅游业必须和我们城市以及泻湖的结构相适应，我们现在要求政府给予答案。” 八年前，一艘意大利邮轮歌诗达协和号（Costa Concordia）在发生触礁事故后，于托斯卡纳海岸倾侧并沉没，33人死亡。 该事故促使意大利当局引入新法案，禁止来自威尼斯的最大邮轮（9.6万吨以上）行驶，较小的船型则被限制在每天五班，但是法案在上诉之后不久又被废除。 去年夏天，这一问题的冲突再次出现。6吨的歌剧号（MSC Opera）邮轮失控，撞进了威尼斯一个码头并撞到一只游艇，两名乘客受伤。 拍下该起事故的手机影片显示，船的号角正在吹响的同时，路人在喊着“退后！”并跑着躲开冲过来的这艘高13层的船。 但是尽管压力越来越大，城市当局以及罗马的全国政府仍然未能为邮轮业的未来制订计划，而威尼斯当地的意见则仍然两极。 邮轮业的反对者称，全球大流行疫情已经显示了，如果邮轮被永久禁止的话，未来可以是什么样子的。 港口工人在火车站台阶抗议的同一天，从威尼斯过桥20分钟车程之外的马格拉，一个废弃的工业地带正在举办一个气候活动营。 威尼斯市内的一些墙壁上，近日贴上了海报，声称新冠疫情与邮轮有关。 呼吁结束使用化石燃料的横幅挂在一个大仓库的墙上，年轻人在那里听演讲者大声呼吁气候正义。 写着“no gradi navi（不要大船）”的旗帜在营外飘扬。 环保活动人士索菲娅·德马西（Sofia Demasi）是“No Grandi Navi”委员会的成员，也是国际气候运动组织“星期五为未来”（Fridays For Future）的一员。 “大邮轮给一个城市造成大量污染，大量的问题，这个城市不应该是气候危机的一个样本，而应该是对抗危机的榜样，”她说。 “No Grandi Navi”的领头人托马索·卡奇亚里（Tommaso Cacciari）说，除了污染，这些船还在破坏这个城市的基石——它造成水下波，会形成侵蚀。 “威尼斯的石头不是混凝土，它们不是用水泥黏合的。它是用泥和水固定在一起的，这些物质非常容易流动，”他说。 “所以这会造成城市地质结构被侵蚀，这是一个大问题。” 环保活动人士索菲娅·德马西：“没有邮轮的威尼斯是一个不一样的地方，而我们很快乐。” 但是，环保人士面对的是与当权者有政治联系的邮轮产业，这是一个困难重重的倡议运动。意大利也有世界上最大的造船企业芬坎蒂尼集团（Fincantieri）。 上月，该公司推出了一款最新的船型——14.5万吨的巨型船，叫做“奇缘公主号”（Enchanted Princess），那是世界最大的游轮公司嘉年华邮轮公司（Carnival Corporation）订造的船。 意大利总理朱塞佩·孔特（Giuseppe Conte）通过视频讯息发出了祝贺。 嘉年华邮轮公司的首席执行官阿诺德·唐纳德（Arnold Donald）则从佛罗里达州通过视像连线参加了仪式。 “我们正在面对我们这个行业内极端困难的时期，”他在芬坎蒂尼集团在蒙法尔科内的船厂内向守着社交距离的人群说。 “我们感谢您，总理，还有您的政府持续的支持。” 嘉年华邮轮公司14.5万吨重的奇缘公主号，近日由意大利造船企业芬坎蒂尼公司交付。 唐纳德表示，嘉年华邮轮公司是意大利经济当中最大的外国投资者之一，指出在过去30年，嘉年华公司在芬坎蒂尼生产的船上投资了300亿欧元（350亿美元；270亿英镑）。 “今天齐聚这里，让我们可以好好地感受这种快乐，海上航行每年带来数以百万计的客人，”他说。 “这也提醒了我们，有大量的人职业和生计都依靠海事产业。” 如今尚不清楚谁将会在这场有关威尼斯邮轮业未来的辩论中取胜，但是要求当局作出决定的压力正在累积。 今年，能够来到威尼斯的访客，有机会看到这个城市在邮轮到来之前原本的样子。 “如果你现在在运河附近漫步，你会看到差别。没有邮轮，威尼斯就是一个不一样的地方，而我们很快乐，”索菲娅·德马西说。 *维拉·曼登戈利（Vera Mantengoli）参与报道。
"Under the treaty, a UN body sets lower international rates for packages from certain countries, a move originally designed to support poorer nations. But the US says the discounts put American businesses at a disadvantage. Officials said they hoped the notice of withdrawal would set the stage to agree a better deal. ""We're looking for a fair system,"" a senior administration official told reporters. ""We do hope that ultimately we achieve a negotiated outcome."" The BBC's Asia business correspondent Karishma Vaswani says the move to pull out of the treaty is aimed at forcing the Chinese to give up the developing nation status they had when they first entered the pact back in 1969. How does the system currently work? International mailing rates are governed by the Universal Postal Union (UPU), a unit of the United Nations that traces its roots back to the 1870s. It subsidises shipments from developing countries while setting higher rates for wealthier nations, including the US. But the White House said China - a major global exporter - was now the biggest beneficiary of that system. The US wants changes to the postal treaty to allow countries to set their own rates for parcels weighing under 2kg (4.4lbs). They are already allowed to do so for bigger packages. The rise of international online shopping has led to a huge increase in the number of small parcels being sent via the postal system. American firms say it can cost significantly more to post an item within the US than it does to send the same item to the US from China. What is the US argument? The bid to overhaul the treaty is part of US President Donald Trump's combative ""America First"" approach to trade, which has led to tariffs on billions of dollars in goods, attacks on existing trade treaties and criticism of multilateral agreements. He has frequently singled out China, which exports more goods to the US than any other country. Officials said the discounts strain the finances of the US Postal Service, facilitate the shipment of counterfeit goods and distort pricing within the US, leading to higher fees for domestic companies. Due to lower rates, foreign packages cost the US about $300m (£228.5m) each year, according to administration estimates. The process of withdrawing from the treaty takes at least a year and the White House said it would be willing to remain in the UPU if negotiations were successful. The US Postal Service and companies such as Amazon and FedEx have complained about the discounts for foreign shippers for many years.",美国宣布计划退出一项144年历史的国际邮政协议，白宫指该协议允许中国以不公平的低价格邮寄货物。,"美国方面表示，现行国际邮政协议中的费用制度对美国不利。 这一项由联合国制定的协议下，从特定国家寄出的国际邮递包裹能享受较低的邮费，这种规定的原意是为了给较贫穷的国家提供支持。 不过，美国声称，这些邮费折扣令美国公司处在不利地位。官员表示，他们希望退出协议的决定能够为更好的协议建立基础。 万国邮政联盟（Universal Postal Union）总干事比什尔·侯赛因（Bishar A. Hussein）对美国的决定表示遗憾。 美国一名高层官员向媒体表示：“我们在寻求一个公平的体系，希望最终我们能够达成一个协商之下的结果。” 官员表示，协议为两公斤以下的邮包设立了邮资限制，但是美国希望修改协议，允许各国能够像对待大邮包一样，自行制定小型邮包的邮费。 跨国境网上购物的兴起，令通过邮政系统寄送的小型包裹数量增多，而美国企业表示，在美国国内寄送一件物品，成本可能比从上海寄送类似的包裹到美国费用更高。 低邮费“令中国受益” 试图推翻这项协议的举动，是美国总统特朗普“美国优先”的竞争性贸易措施的一部分。他的这种主张下，美国不仅对数以十亿美元计的产品加征关税，而且对一些现有的贸易协定和多边协议发起批评和攻击。 在相关议题上，特朗普经常提到每年对美国出口数十亿美元商品的中国。 美国官员指，这样的邮政折扣条款对美国邮政署（US Postal Service）造成了财政掣肘，也助长了伪劣产品的流通，并且影响美国国内的产品定价，从而导致美国本土企业需要花费更多的费用。 据美国政府估算，与国际邮政价格优惠有关的境外包裹邮寄每年令美国损失大约3亿美元（2.285亿英镑）。 协调世界各国邮政服务的邮政总联盟成立于1874年，四年后更名为万国邮政联盟，其目的是统一各国不同的邮政服务和规定。自机构成立以来，国际邮递价格一直由万国邮政联盟监管。 如今美国担心的是，万国邮政如何制定不同国家邮政部门之间对跨境来往包裹的收费。 低价格的邮费制度是为了帮助一些较贫穷的国家控制成本。但是白宫表示，中国作为一个全球出口大国，现在已经是这个体系的最大受益者。 退出万国邮政协议至少要一年之后才会生效，由此就给重新商讨相关条款创造了条件。 低廉国际邮费的“秘密” BBC中文网驻华盛顿记者 冯兆音 根据全国公共广播电台（National Public Radio, 简称NPR）的报道，一只在中国生产、免邮费邮寄到美国的陶瓷马克杯在电商网站上的售价是5.69美元，而仅仅是把在美国本地产的类似商品送到仓库对街的运费，就要6.3美元。 为什么一只杯子穿越万里的运费，反而低于本地运费？这与万国邮政联盟的邮费制度息息相关 - 寄件者只需支付中国邮政将杯子运到美国某地物流中心的费用，由于这一段路程有规模化运输，成本相对较低；而人力成本较高的“最后一里路”，从物流中心分发杯子、送到收件人门前的费用则由美国邮政署承担。 美国邮政署的数据显示，在美国国内运送两公斤包裹的费用，是从中国向美国运同重量包裹的国际邮资的四倍。这就是千千万万中国制商品能低价运至美国的“秘密”。 目前，美国退出万国邮政联盟的决定受到国内小商品生产商的欢迎。在中期选举前夕，特朗普借此向目标选民强化了他的政府致力保护“美国制造”的形象。 而美国“退群”会否引起其他成员国退出万国邮政联盟，又将如何影响市场总值23亿美元的跨境电商行业，依然有待观察。 价格在调整 另一方面，有官员表示，美国国内又将会开始重新制定邮政价格的程序，最快有可能在六个月之后生效。 官员称，修改后的规定有可能令来自中国的邮寄包裹费用上升40%到70%。 虽然这有可能会提高消费者从中国购买商品的邮递费用，但官员表示，这些成本比不上结束“经济扭曲”之后带来的好处。 美国邮政署以及像亚马逊（Amazon）、联邦快递（FedEx）等公司均为外国发货人享受的邮费优惠（正式名称为“终端费”）而抱怨多年。 此前，为了应对美国的担忧，万国邮政联盟已经开始调整这项每四年调整一次的费用。根据美国政府在2017年就相关问题发表的报告指，至2021年，预计“只有发展程度最低的国家”才会保持相同的费用。 各方反应 万国邮政联盟总干事侯塞因在周三（10月17日）发表声明表示，对于美国的决定感到遗憾，同时乐意与美国官员继续对话。 他表示，万国邮政联盟仍将继续致力于为全部192个成员国制定最好的协议。 特朗普的决定或会更彰显美国与中国近期在广泛贸易领域上的紧张关系，不过美国邮政署以及其国内邮政行业机构则对决定表示欢迎。 全美制造商协会（National Association of Manufacturers）主席蒂蒙斯（Jay Timmons）在一份声明中指，现时的国际邮政协议“已经过时”，并且间接帮助了“伪劣商品和危险药物”从中国“涌入”美国。 联合包裹速递服务公司（UPS）则表示，美国政府“走了正确的一步”。 这是特朗普就任总统之后以“美国优先”为由与一系列国际组织或协议割裂的又一举动。 上任第一周，特朗普就宣布美国退出《跨太平洋伙伴关系协定》（TPP），之后又先后退出巴黎气候协议和联合国教科文组织等。"
"The government has been accused of brutally oppressing citizens while ruthlessly pursuing the development of nuclear weapons. In the past year it held its fifth nuclear test, launched several missiles and - most believe - assassinated its leader's half-brother using a chemical weapon. Most recently, it has conducted its first test of what it claims is an inter-continental ballistic missile, a move that - if verified - increases the threat it can pose to its enemies and ratchets up international tensions. But why is North Korea such a problem - and why can no solution be found? A potted history The US and the Soviets divided Korea into two at the end of World War Two. Reunification talks failed and by 1948 there were two separate governments. The 1950-53 Korean War entrenched the split. North Korea's first leader was Kim Il-sung, a communist who presided over a one-party state, and the grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-un. It remains one of the world's poorest nations. Its economy is centrally controlled, its citizens have no access to external media and, apart from a privileged few, no freedom to leave. Most worryingly, it has conducted five nuclear and multiple missile tests that demonstrate progress towards its ultimate goal of building a nuclear missile. So what about negotiations? There have been several rounds. The most recent, involving China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and the US, initially looked promising. Pyongyang agreed to give up its nuclear work in return for aid and political concessions. It went as far as blowing up the cooling tower at its plutonium production facility at Yongbyon. But then things faltered. The US said North Korea was failing to disclose the full extent of its nuclear work. Pyongyang denied this, but then conducted a nuclear test. So, since 2009, there have been no meaningful discussions. John Nilsson-Wright, senior fellow for north-east Asia at think-tank Chatham House, says that North Korea, judging from its recent provocations, is not interested in negotiating at the moment. ""This is because Kim is determined to push forward on military modernisation, so rationally it is in his interests to delay."" But economic pressure would work, right? The UN and several nations already have sanctions in place against North Korea, targeting its weapons programme and financial ability to function abroad. Meanwhile food aid to North Korea - which relies on donations to feed its people - has fallen in recent years as tensions have risen. But these measures do not seem to be slowing down North Korea's ability to move forward on the military front. China is widely seen as the nation most able to impose economic pain on North Korea. Experts say targeting the intermediaries that keep North Korea moving - like Chinese banks - would make a real impact, as would targeting the oil that Pyongyang imports from China. This is some movement on this. A Reuters report in late June, citing unidentified sources, said China's state oil giant had suspended sales to Pyongyang, though it suggested the decision was commercial. The US, meanwhile, has imposed sanctions on a Chinese bank accused of laundering North Korean money. But the key problem is that China does not want to take actions that would destabilise the government in North Korea and potentially unleash chaos on its border. So, John Nilsson-Wright says, China has been trying to play the role of honest broker, lobbying the US to talk to Pyongyang. But the US, Japan and South Korea have made it very clear that the North must show a real willingness to compromise before talks become an option. Is there a military option? Not a good one. It is generally thought that military action against North Korea would lead to very high military and civilian casualties. Finding and eliminating North Korea's nuclear stockpile would be hard - experts suspect assets are buried deep underground. Moreover the North is heavily armed, with an arsenal of missiles putting Seoul (and beyond) in range, chemical and biological weapons, and about one million troops. ""The risk is that it provokes a counterattack that is massively costly to South Korea,"" says Dr Nilsson-Wright. What about assassination? In the past South Korea has talked overtly about a ""decapitation"" strategy - a targeted attack to remove Kim Jong-un and his leadership. This could be a tactic to deter North Korea from further provocations or to force it back to the negotiating table, says Dr Nilsson-Wright. The strong view in Seoul, he says, is that the only way to get the North back to the negotiating table is to make the government feel so insecure that it feels it has no choice. There are also big questions around who might fill the vacuum if a ""decapitation"" went ahead. The elite have a vested interest in the survival of the Kim government and there is no political opposition. How about a gradual opening? For a while some thought that the way to bring North Korea into the international community was to help it open up gradually, through small economic reforms, using the model of China's transformation after the death of Mao Zedong There were signs Kim Jong-il - the leader's late father - may have been interested in this approach, as he made several trips to Chinese industrial zones. The key supporter of this, however, was thought to be Chang Song-thaek, the leader's uncle. But Kim Jong-un had him executed in December 2013, calling him a traitor who planned to overthrow the state. Kim Jong-un has not yet visited China - in fact, he has not visited any foreign country since becoming leader in 2011. And while he has talked of economic growth, the military programme appears to be his priority. Could a credible opposition emerge? This is very unlikely. One-party rule is absolute in North Korea. Citizens are encouraged to worship the Kim dynasty, which is portrayed as the only institution keeping them safe from external aggression. There are no independent media. All TV, radio and newspapers are state-controlled and North Korea has created its own internet so citizens have no electronic access to the outside world. There is a limited flow of information across the Chinese border, including DVDs which are smuggled in. But in general North Korea exercises very tight control over its citizens. The government has informants everywhere looking for signs of dissent and penalties are severe. Offenders (and sometimes their whole families) can be sent to labour camps where many die. So what's the best option? There needs to be a mixture of pressure and dialogue, says Dr Nilsson-Wright. Pressure, he suggests, could involve some combination of enhanced sanctions, the relisting of North Korea as a State Sponsor of Terrorism (it was removed from the list in 2008), and close work with China to inflict real pain. Possible incentives could include formal diplomatic recognition by the US or a peace treaty (the two Koreas remain technically at war). Key to this approach would be co-ordination between the US, China, South Korea and Japan. But there are problems. After initial apparent warmth, ties between the Trump administration and Beijing seem to be cooling. In June US President Donald Trump tweeted that China's approach to North Korea had ""not worked out"". Ties between Japan, South Korea and China remain fractious over historical issues. Beijing is also fiercely opposed to the deployment by the US of a Thaad missile defence system in South Korea. In Seoul, new liberal President Moon Jae-in must walk a fine line balancing the interests of his electorate, biggest military ally and powerful neighbour. So there are divisions to exploit. ""That is why North Korea is pushing it now - it knows it has a window on which to capitalise,"" Dr Nilsson-Wright argues.",“流氓国家”、“最大的直接威胁”……世界对朝鲜有很多标签，当中很少是正面的。,朝鲜在本月较早前发射四枚导弹 该国政府被指残酷地打压国民，同时不顾一切地寻求发展核武器。 最近几个月，朝鲜进行了第五次核试验，发射了几枚导弹，以及多数人相信，他们用化学武器暗杀了领导人的异母兄弟。 但是，为什么朝鲜这么麻烦？而且，为什么一直找不到解决的办法？ 简短历史 朝鲜的成立发生在1950－53年朝鲜战争之后，朝鲜半岛从此一分为二。首任领导人金日成是一个共产主义者，统领着一个一党专政的政府，也是现任领导人金正恩的祖父。 它至今仍是全世界最贫穷的国家之一。它的经济由中央统一控制，国民没有办法接触外界媒体，并且除了极少数人之外，都没有出国的自由。 最令人担忧的是，它已经进行了五次核试验和多次的导弹试射，以显示最终要走向建造核武导弹的进程。 金正恩是否还在等待谈判的更好时机？ 谈判可以吗？ 谈判有过好几轮。最近的一轮有中国、韩国、日本、俄罗斯和美国的参与，一开始看似相当有希望。 平壤曾同意放弃核事业以换取援助和政治让步。谈判一度发展到了讨论将宁边的铀元素设备冷却塔炸毁的问题，后来一切却崩塌了。美国指朝鲜未有向外界公开全部的核事业设施。平壤对此表示否认，但之后又进行了一次核试。于是，自2009年以来，再未有过任何有实质意义的谈判。 智库机构查塔姆研究所（Chatham House）的东北亚事务资深专员约翰·尼尔森－怀特表示，从近期挑起的争端来判断，朝鲜在目前并没有兴趣进行谈判。 “这是因为金正恩决心推进武器现代化，所以常理来说，推迟（谈判）对他有利。” 经济施压总有用吧？ 联合国以及好几个国家已经对朝鲜实施制裁，打击目标是其武器项目和在国外进行财政运转的能力。最近的一项措施是针对平壤的煤矿出口。 与此同时，随着近年紧张关系加剧，对朝粮食援助有所下降——它很大程度上依赖于捐献，来让国民得以温饱。 不过，尼尔森－怀特博士说，这些措施似乎并没有阻挡朝鲜推进军事的能力。 他说，只有针对那些让朝鲜得以周转的中介——比如中国的银行——所进行的措施才会有真正的影响力。针对平壤从中国进口石油等也会有直接的效用。 但问题在于中国，它不想采取令朝鲜政府瘫痪的措施，从而在两国边境制造混乱。 相反，尼尔森－怀特表示，中国在试图扮演一个诚实的掮客角色，游说美国与平壤对话。可是，虽然唐纳德·特朗普（Donald Trump）在竞选时曾说他愿意与金正恩吃汉堡聊天，但是美国、日本和韩国已经清楚的显示，朝鲜必须摆出真正愿意妥协的意愿，谈判才会成为一个选项。 朝鲜的煤矿出口成为打击目标 军事打击是其中一个选择吗？ 不会是个好的选择。外界广泛认为，对朝鲜进行军事行动将会导致非常大的军民死伤。 找到并且清除朝鲜的核设施将会很困难——专家们怀疑，有关设施深埋在地下。况且，朝鲜有相当多的武器，储备的导弹射程范围包括了首尔，还有化学和生物武器，军队人数约100万。 尼尔森－怀特博士说：“风险在于它会招致反击，这对韩国来说代价将非常惨重。” 刺杀行动呢？ 最近几个月，韩国曾公开谈论过“斩首”政策——以推翻金正恩和他的政府为目标的定点攻击。 尼尔森－怀特说，这可能是阻止朝鲜进一步进行挑衅并迫使它回到谈判桌上的一种策略。他表示，首尔方面的强烈态度是，令朝鲜重新进入谈判的唯一办法是令朝鲜政府感到不安全，觉得没有选择。 假如“斩首”行动真的实施，谁将填补权力真空也将成为大问题。朝鲜的政治精英对于保留金正恩政府有既定的利益，并且目前也没有政治上的敌对派。 朝韩均有火力和军力展开战争 逐渐开放？ 有一段时间，一些人认为将朝鲜带入国际社会的办法就是帮助它逐渐开放，借用中国在毛泽东去世后进行社会转型的模式，进行小规模的经济改革。 金正恩的已故父亲金正日或许曾经有考虑过这一点，因为他曾经数次致词中国的工业区。不过，这一方向的核心支持者是金正恩的姑父张成泽。金正恩将他定为试图颠覆政权的叛国者，在2013年12日处决了他。 金正恩尚未到访过中国——事实上，他哪里都没有去过。虽然他谈及过经济发展，但是军事项目明显是他的头等大事。 有可能出现可信任的反对派吗？ 这不太可能。一党专政在朝鲜是绝对的。朝鲜人民被鼓吹崇拜金氏政权，将之视为唯一可以抵抗外敌入侵、保障他们安全的政权。 那里没有独立的媒体。所有的电视、电台和报纸都由政府控制；并且朝鲜建立了它自己的互联网，于是国民也没有连通外部世界的途径。 在与中国接壤的边境，有非常有限的信息得以流通，包括走私进入的DVD影碟。但总体上，朝鲜对民众实行非常严密的控制。政府在到处都有追踪异见的眼线，而惩罚是非常严厉的。违规者（有时候还诛连整个家庭）可能会被送到劳改营，很多人死在那里。 朝鲜政府对于民众可以看到什么有严格的控制 最好的选择是什么？ 尼尔森－怀特表示，要有施压和对话相重手段。他表示，施压可能包括一些更强的制裁措施，将朝鲜重新列为资助恐怖主义的政府（它在2008年被从名单中撤下），并与中国紧密合作，施以真正有力的打击。而可能的回报或许是美国正式承认其外交地位，或者达成和平协议（朝韩在理论上仍处于战争状态）。 这一策略的关键是美国、中国、韩国和日本之间的协调。但是，美国刚刚有新一届政府上任，韩国又正处政治动荡。日本、韩国和中国之间又仍然存在着对历史问题的分歧。北京正强烈反对在美国在韩国部署萨德导弹防御体系。所以，仍有很多分歧有待解决。 尼尔森－怀特表示：“这也是为什么朝鲜现在正在试图步步进逼——它知道，它有一个窗口可以从中获益。”
"The Chinese government has already evacuated more than 3,000 people, Chinese state-run media report. The first ship set sail on Sunday, while 16 critically injured Chinese nationals left Vietnam on a chartered flight, Xinhua news agency said. Two Chinese workers have been killed and dozens more injured in unrest over a Chinese oil rig in disputed waters. On Saturday the Vietnamese government called for an end to the protests. Officials said ""illegal acts"" would be stopped as they could damage national stability. However, dissident groups have urged people to rally again in major cities on Sunday and the authorities broke up some anti-China protests in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. In recent days crowds have set fire to at least 15 foreign-owned factories - including Chinese, Taiwanese and South Korean businesses - in several Vietnamese industrial parks. 'Dissatisfied' Correspondents say the attacks appear to have worried authorities, as Hanoi depends heavily on foreign investment for economic growth. However, China has urged authorities to take tougher measures to punish rioters. ""We are strongly dissatisfied by the Vietnamese side failure to respond effectively to curb an escalation,"" Xinhua quoted security chief Guo Shengkun as saying on Saturday. The protests have been triggered by China's decision to move its Haiyang Shiyou 981 oil rig into contested waters in the South China Sea. This led to confrontations between Vietnamese and Chinese ships earlier this month, as Vietnam sought to block the move. China insists it will continue drilling in the area, west of the Paracel Islands - which are controlled by China but also claimed by Vietnam, and Taiwan. Nationalist sentiment is currently running very high in Vietnam over the issue, correspondents say. Many of those evacuated are workers employed at Chinese-owned factories or construction projects in Vietnam, says the BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Beijing.",面对新一轮针对中国在西沙群岛（越南称黄沙群岛）钻油的反华示威威胁，中国交通运输部加派五艘船只到越南，加快撤侨进度。,河内警方驱散零星示威者与在场采访的记者。 新华社报道，第一艘船只已于星期天（5月18日）早上从海南海口出发。当日凌晨，中国政府的医疗包机也从越南荣市接载16名在河静省示威中受重伤的中国公民返抵四川成都。 与此同时，首都河内警方阻止民众再次游行。美联社与台湾中央社报道，警方驱散了试图在中国大使馆门前集会的示威者与记者。 河静省上周的示威造成两名中国公民死亡、100多人受伤。BBC驻北京记者顾求真报道说，在北京提出批评之后，越南似乎确在采取行动控制局势。 法新社报道，主要由越南反政府组织组成的非政府组织联盟号召群众星期天在首都河内、南部的胡志明市等地，就中国在南中国海的“挑衅”举行新一轮抗议活动。但他们也呼吁抗议者避免暴力行为。 越南官方上周默许同类游行进行，但当地台商在河静省暴力示威发生后对BBC中文网说，当局已经下令禁止示威。 河内警方封锁中国使馆附近街道并禁止拍摄。 胡志明市据称有示威者被带走。 强行驱散 美联社报道，河内警方星期天封锁了中国大使馆附近的街道和一个公园，并驱散聚集的示威者；胡志明市有数名示威者被当局拉走。 中央社引述身处胡志明市的台湾外交部领务局长龚中诚说，因越南政府已有相当准备严禁大规模游行，示威活动变成特定定点的静态抗议，胡志明市“大致上蛮平静的”。 台湾企业也在河静省的反华示威中遭遇重创，台北政府的救助能力受到批评。龚中诚说，台方已在越南设置了13个避难所接待台商、台侨。 稍早前，台湾总统马英九要求台方专机随时待命，星期天必要时立刻到越南协助台商、台侨离开。 中国外交部则表示，截至星期六下午，中方已接回3000多人。由外交部部长助理刘建超率领的中国政府跨部门工作组星期五已抵达越南交涉，商定了接回16名重伤伤者的方案。 本月初，中国交通运输部海事局宣布中海油981号钻油平台在南海西沙群岛钻探至8月份，双方各数十艘船艇其后在钻探现场冲突碰撞。越南随后出现了大规模的反华示威。 中共《人民日报海外版》星期六刊登头版评论再次批评越南，并称国际社会需重新思考越南的投资价值，但同时称推进亚洲地区互信已刻不容缓。 BBC越南语网说，过去几天，许多越南人对反华示威中出现暴力行径感到震惊。一些著名博客作者纷纷在网上发言呼吁抗议者和平示威，避免使用暴力。 （撰稿／责编：叶靖斯） 对于越南国内的反华抗议升级您有何看法？BBC中文网邀请您 参与讨论。
"The male caretakers and maintenance staff allege they are being sexually discriminated against. Eight other men have had their cases stayed pending the outcome of the current tribunal in Cardiff. The workers are seeking more than £700,000 in wages they say they should have been paid over a six-year period. An employment tribunal will determine whether the men were discriminated against. All were originally employed by Swansea Metropolitan University, which merged with the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in August last year. The men's claims focus on changes to contracts which saw standard 37-hour working weeks introduced. Previously, the men had been on a 45-hour week. The hearing was told that university officials agreed to continue offering the men an extra eight hours of overtime a week. But when the new contracts were brought in, the workmen said they found they were on a lower hourly rate of pay than women workers on the same grade. Representing the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, Peter Wallington QC told the tribunal that this was a ""complex case"" and he will argue the university has a defence under the Equality Act. The hearing continues.",十八名男子声称他们的工资低于女性同事，向威尔士三一圣戴维大学（University of Wales Trinity Saint David）提起诉讼，要求赔偿。,大学男职员要求赔偿 这些男性管理员和维修员工指称他们受性别歧视对待。 另外八名男子在此之前已经提起诉讼，正等待卡迪夫审裁处的裁决结果。 这些男性职员要求超过70万英镑的工资赔偿，他们说这应该是过去六年他们所得。 劳资审裁处将裁决这些男子是否受到性别歧视。 他们原本受聘于斯旺西城市大学（Swansea Metropolitan University），这家大学去年8月与威尔士三一圣戴维大学合并。 这些男职员的申诉焦点是合约的修改，从他们原本的每周45小时工作改为标准的37小时。 他们在审裁处指出，大学当局原本同意继续为他们提供每周额外的8小时超时补贴。但是他们说，新合约生效后，他们的每小时工资低于同级的女性职员。 代表大学的大律师彼得·沃灵顿在审裁处说，这是一起“复杂的案例”，他将会以平等法令为大学辩护。 （编译：田耕；责编：横路）
"By Prof Rana MitterUniversity of Oxford The country is perhaps more aware of its own history than any other major society on earth. That remembering is certainly partial - events like Mao's Cultural Revolution are still very difficult to discuss within China itself. But it is striking how many echoes of the past can be found in its present. Trade China remembers a time when it was forced to trade against its will. Today it regards Western efforts to open its markets as a reminder of that unhappy period. The US and China are currently in a dispute over whether China is selling into the US while closing its own markets to American goods. Yet the balance of trade hasn't always been in China's favour. In Beijing, there are long memories of a period, nearly a century and a half ago, when China had little control over its own trade. Britain attacked China in a series of Opium Wars, starting in 1839. In the decades that followed, Britain founded an institution called the Imperial Maritime Customs Service to fix tariffs on goods imported into China. It was part of the Chinese government, but it was a very British institution, run not by a mandarin from Beijing, but a man from Portadown. Sir Robert Hart ended up becoming inspector-general of the Customs of China, which became a fiefdom for Brits for a century afterwards. Hart was honest and helped to generate a great deal of income for China. But the memories of that time still rankle. It was very different in the Ming dynasty, in the early 15th Century, when Admiral Zheng took seven great fleets to South East Asia, Ceylon and even the coast of East Africa to trade and show off China's might. Zheng He's voyages were partly about making an impression. Few other empires could boast the massive fleets that it sent out across the oceans, and it was also an opportunity for strange and wonderful items be brought back to Beijing - such as China's first giraffe. However, trade was also important, particularly in other parts of Asia. And Zhen could, and did, fight when he wanted to, defeating at least one ruler of Ceylon. Yet his voyages were a rare example of a state-driven maritime project. Most of China's overseas trade for the next few centuries would be unofficial. Trouble with the neighbours China has always been concerned to keep states on its borders pacified. That's part of the reason it deals so warily with an unpredictable North Korea today. This is not the first time that China has had problems with those on its borders. In fact, history reveals it has had worse neighbours than North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who recently made a surprise visit to Beijing, his first known foreign trip since taking office in 2011. During the Song dynasty in 1127, a woman named Li Qingzhao fled her home in the city of Kaifeng. We know her story because she was one of China's finest poets, and her works are still widely read. She went on the run because her state was under attack. A people from the north, the Jurchen, had burst into China after a long period of uneasy alliance with the ruling Song dynasty's emperor. The elite of China's civilisation had to spread themselves across the country as cities burned. Li Qingzhao saw her beloved art collection scattered between various cities. Her dynasty's fate was an object lesson that appeasing the neighbours may work for only so long. For some time, the Jin dynasty ruled Northern China, and the Song founded a new realm in the south. But in the end, both fell to a new conqueror, the Mongols. The shifting lines on the map show that the definition of China has changed over time. Chinese culture is associated with certain ideas such as language, history and ethical systems like Confucianism. However, other peoples, including Manchus and Mongols from the north, have taken China's throne at various points, ruling the country using the same ideas and principles upon which their ethnic Chinese counterparts relied. These neighbours did not always stay put. But sometimes they embraced and exercised Chinese values just as effectively as the people from whom they took them. Information flow Today China's internet censors politically sensitive material, and those who utter political truths deemed problematic by the authorities may be arrested or worse. The difficulty of speaking truth to power has long been an issue. China's historians have often felt they had to write what the state wanted rather than what they thought was important. But Sima Qian - often dubbed China's ""grand historian"" - chose a different path. The author of one of the most important works chronicling China's past, in the 1st Century BC, he dared to defend a general who had lost a battle. In doing so he was held to have snubbed the emperor, and was sentenced to castration. Yet he left behind a legacy which has shaped the writing of history in China to this day. Find out more: His Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) mixed different types of sources, critiqued figures from the historical past, and also used the techniques of oral history to find out directly from participants what had actually happened. All of this was a very new way of doing history, but it set a precedent for later writers: if you were willing to risk your safety, you could write history ""warts and all"", rather than censoring yourself. Freedom of religion Modern China is much more tolerant of religious practice than in the days of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution - within limits - but past experience makes it cautious about faith-driven movements which could potentially spiral out of control and pose a challenge to the government. Records show that openness to religion has long been part of Chinese history. At the height of the Tang dynasty in the 7th Century, the Empress Wu Zetian embraced Buddhism as a way of pushing back against what she must have regarded as the stifling norms of China's Confucian traditions. In the Ming dynasty, the Jesuit Matteo Ricci arrived at court and was treated as a respected interlocutor, although there was perhaps more interest in his knowledge of Western science than his slightly wan attempts to convert his listeners. But faith has always been a dangerous business. In the late 19th Century, China was convulsed by a rebellion started by Hong Xiuquan, a man who claimed to be Jesus's younger brother. The Taiping rebellion promised to bring a kingdom of heavenly peace to China but actually led to one of the bloodiest civil wars in history, killing as many as 20 million people, according to some accounts. Government troops initially failed to tame the rebels, and had to allow local soldiers to reform themselves before they eventually put down the Taiping with great cruelty in 1864. Christianity would be at the centre of another uprising some decades later. In 1900, peasant rebels calling themselves Boxers would appear in north China, calling for death to Christian missionaries and converts, the latter being characterised as traitors to China. At first, the Imperial Court backed them, which led to the death of many Chinese Christians, before the uprising was eventually put down. Through much of the following century, and to the present day, the Chinese state has veered between tolerance of religion, and the fear that it may upend the state. Technology Today China seeks to become a world hub for new technology. A century ago it went through an earlier industrial revolution - and women were central to both. China is a world leader when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), voice recognition, and big data. A large number of the smartphones around the world are built with Chinese-made chips. Many of the factories which manufacture them are staffed by young women who often endure horrific conditions of work, but who are also finding a place in the industrial market economy for the first time. They have inherited the experience of the young women who came 100 years ago to the factories that sprang up in Shanghai and the Yangtze delta. They were not making computer chips, but silk and cotton threads. Work was hard and likely to cause lung disease or physical injury, and conditions in the workers' dormitories were spartan. Yet the women also recalled the pleasure of having their own wages, however, small, and the ability to visit a fair or theatre on a rare holiday. Some made the journey to look - probably not buy - at the shiny new department stores in central Shanghai, one of the ultimate symbols of modernity. Today, on Nanjing Road in that city, you can still see China's new working and middle class enjoying a wide range of consumer goods as part of China's contemporary tech-driven economy. The view from future historians? We are living through another significantly transformative era for China. Future historians will note that a country that was poor and inward-looking in 1978 became - within a quarter of a century - the second biggest economy in the world. They will also note that China was the most important country to push back against what had seemed like an inevitable tide of democratisation. Perhaps other factors such as the one-child policy (now ended) and the use of AI surveillance may catch future writers' attention. Or maybe it will be something else to do with the environment, space exploration or economic growth, which is not yet even obvious to us. One thing is almost certain - a century from now, China will still be a place of fascination for those who live there and those who live with it, and its rich history will continue to inform its present and future direction.

Edited by Jennifer Clarke",要理解今日中国处理贸易、外交政策或网络审查等问题的新闻，得从它的历史中寻求答案。,"中国思想家、哲学家孔子 中国也许比世界上任何其他大国都更了解自己的历史。这种铭记当然是片面的，像毛泽东发动的文化大革命至今仍难以在中国被讨论，但在现代中国能发现多少过去的印记仍然令人吃惊。 贸易 中国仍然记得它违背自身意愿被迫开展贸易的那段时期，今天它看到西方努力打开其市场，仍然不时提醒自己那段不愉快的经历。 中美两国目前在争论，中国是否对美国产品关闭市场的同时将自己的产品销往美国。然而，贸易差额并不总是对中国有利。 对于北京来说，他们记得将近一个半世纪以前，有很长一段时间中国几乎难以控制自身贸易。 1839年以来，英国通过一系列的鸦片战争袭击了中国，在那之后的数十年，英国成立了大清皇家海关总税务司来决定进口到中国产品的关税。 这是中国政府的一部分，但这个机构非常英国化，由一名来自英国波塔当的人掌控，而不是北京的中国政府高级官员。 赫德爵士 赫德爵士（Robert Hart）最终成为海关总税务司，海关在后来一个世纪变成了英国人的封地。赫德很诚实，帮助中国获得了大量收入。 但是那段时间的记忆仍然令人愤怒。 在15世纪早期的明朝，情况大不相同。当时郑和曾七次下西洋，到了东南亚、锡兰（现在的斯里兰卡）甚至东非海岸，与其他国家开展贸易，展示中国的实力。 郑和曾七次下西洋 郑和的远洋航海一部分也是为给他国留下印象。那时，只有少数其他国家可以夸耀跨洋大型舰队。郑和的航行也是将奇异的东西带回北京的好机会，比如给中国带回了第一只长颈鹿。 但是贸易也很重要，尤其是在亚洲的其他地区。郑和如果愿意，还可以并且确实打败了至少一名锡兰统治者，但他的航行是罕见的国家驱动的海上项目，未来几个世纪中国大部分海外贸易都是非官方的。 邻国的麻烦 中国一直注重保持邻国的安定，这也是它现今谨慎处理朝鲜问题的原因。 这不是中国第一次与邻国间存在问题。 事实上，历史显示中国曾有过比朝鲜领导人金正恩更糟糕的邻居。金正恩近日突然访问北京，这是他自2011年执政以来第一次已知海外访问。 金正恩早前曾访问中国 1127年宋朝时，一名叫李清照的女子逃离了开封的家，因为她的国家被袭击了。李清照是中国最出色的词人之一，作品也广为人知，所以我们知道她的故事。 北方的女真族与宋朝皇帝保持了一段长时期不稳定的结盟后，女真族闯入了中国。中国的文化精英不得不在城市被烧毁时四处逃亡。 李清照看见她珍爱的艺术藏品散落在多个城市。她那个朝代的命运是一个实例，安抚邻国可能只能有这么长时间的效果。 一段时间内，金朝统治着中国北部地区，宋朝则在南方建立了新的南宋王朝。但最终，金朝和南宋都被蒙古人征服。 成吉思汗 地图上的变化线显示，中国的定义随着时间有所改变。中国的文化与语言、历史及儒家思想等道德体系有关。 然而，包括满洲人和北方蒙古人在内的其他民族却多次占据了中国的王位，用同样的思想和原则来进行统治。 信息流 现今中国网络审查政治敏感信息，那些大声说出自己政治观点但在当局眼中这些观点有问题的人，可能会被捕甚至更糟。 对当权者讲真话一直很困难。中国的历史学家常常必须写一些统治者想要的东西，而不是他们认为重要的东西。 但是，被称为中国“太史公”的司马迁选择了另一条路。 司马迁写出了中国最重要的史书之一《史记》 司马迁写出了中国最重要的史书之一《史记》。公元前一世纪，他为一名打了败仗的将军辩护，被认为怠慢了皇帝，被处以宫刑。 但是，他留下了的遗产重塑了历史的书写方式。 他的《史记》记载了不同类型的资料，评论了过去的历史人物，并运用口述历史的技巧直接从参与者那里了解到实际发生的事情。 所有这些都是记录历史的全新方式，给后人创造了先例：如果你愿意冒风险，你可以不自我审查、“毫不掩盖”地书写历史。 宗教自由 比起文化大革命时期，现代中国在一定范围内对宗教活动宽容了许多，但是过去的经验让中国对信仰驱动的运动十分谨慎，因为这些运动可能会失去控制，并对政府形成挑战。 记录显示，历史上中国一直对宗教保持开放。 During her 7th Century reign, Empress Wu Zetian embraced and promoted Buddhism 在7世纪唐朝的鼎盛时期，女皇武则天拥护佛教，以抵制她眼中儒家传统令人压抑的规范。 明朝时，耶稣会士利玛窦（Matteo Ricci）曾在法庭上被当作一名受尊敬的谈话者，尽管比起他想改变听众信仰的微弱意图，人们可能对他的西方科学知识更感兴趣。 但是信仰一直都是一桩危险的事。 19世纪晚期，中国曾因洪秀全领导的反叛军而剧烈震动。洪秀全自称是耶稣的幼弟。 根据一些报道，太平天国承诺给中国带来天国般平静的王国，但实际上却引发了内战。这次是史上最血腥的内战之一，据估计有2000万人因此丧生。 政府军队起初并未制服叛乱军，不得不允许当地士兵进行自身改革，之后在1864年用残忍的手段镇压了太平军。 太平天国最终被镇压 几十年后，基督教成为了另一场起义的中心。1900年，农民反叛军义和团在中国北部出现，呼吁处死基督教传教士和皈依者，后者被形容为中国的卖国贼。 最初，义和团得到了皇室的支持，这导致了许多中国基督徒的死亡，最后起义被镇压。 在接下来的几个世纪至今，中国政府一直在对宗教宽容和担忧它可能颠覆国家之间徘徊。 科技 今日的中国寻求成为新技术的世界中心。一个世纪前，它经历了一场早期的工业革命，女性一直是两者的中心。 在人工智能、语音识别和大数据方面，中国处于世界领先地位。 全球大量智能手机使用的是中国制造的芯片，许多生产他们的工厂都雇佣了年轻女性，她们常常忍受着恶劣的工作环境，但也是第一次在工业市场经济中找到一席之地。 她们继承了100年前在上海和长江三角洲涌现的工厂中工作的年轻女工的经验。 100年前，她们不是制作电脑芯片，而是丝绸和棉线。 工作很辛苦，也可能引发肺炎或身体损伤，工人宿舍的条件也很艰苦。 尽管工资很少，但是女工会想起拥有自己工资的愉悦，她们也有能力在少有的假日中去集市和剧院了。 有的人会去看上海市中心闪耀的百货商场，但可能不会买。上海市中心是现代化的最大标志之一。 在今日的上海南京路，你仍然可以看到中国的新工人和中产阶层享受着大批消费品，这是中国现代信息驱动经济的一部分。 未来历史学家的观点？ 我们正在经历中国又一个显著的变革时代，未来的历史学家将注意到，中国在1978年很贫穷，对外界并不关心，但它在25年内变成了世界上第二大经济体。 他们也会发现，中国是抵制看上去不可抵挡的民主化浪潮的最重要国家。 也许如一孩政策（目前已经停止）和人工智能监视的使用等其他因素将被未来写作者注意。或者可能与环境、空间探索或经济增长有关，这些对我们来说目前并不明显。 有一件事是几乎可以肯定的，从现在开始的一个世纪，中国仍然对生活在那里以及生活在那里并忍受这个国家的人有吸引力，其丰富的历史将继续影响它的现在和未来走向。 拉那·密特（Rana Mitter）是牛津大学现代中国历史和政治教授，也是牛津大学中国中心主任。"
"By Tim HarfordBBC World Service, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy My left-hand little finger holds the shift key, then the other fingers of my left hand clumsily crab sideways across the upper row. Q-W-E-R-T-Y. There's a lesson here: it matters where the keys sit on your keyboard. There are good arrangements and bad ones. Many people think that qwerty is a bad one - in fact, that it was deliberately designed to be slow and awkward. Could that be true? And why do economists, of all people, argue about this? It turns out that the stakes are higher than they might first appear.

But let's start by figuring out why anyone might have been perverse enough to want to slow down typists. In the early 1980s, I persuaded my mother Deb to let me use her mechanical typewriter, a miraculous contraption which would transcend my awful handwriting. When I hit a key, a lever would flick up from behind the keyboard and whack hard against an inked ribbon, squeezing that ink against a sheet of paper. On the end of the lever - called a type bar - would be a pair of reversed letters in relief. I discovered that if I hit several keys at once, the type bars all flew up at the same time into the same spot. Fun for a nine-year-old boy, less so for a professional typist. Typing at 60 words per minute (wpm) - no stretch for a good typist - means five or six letters striking the same spot each second. At such a speed, the typist might need to be slowed down for the sake of the typewriter. That is what qwerty supposedly did. Then again, if qwerty really was designed to be slow, how come the most popular pair of letters in English, T-H, are adjacent and right under the index fingers? The plot thickens. The father of the qwerty keyboard was Christopher Latham Sholes, a printer from Wisconsin who sold his first typewriter in 1868 to Porter's Telegraph College, Chicago. That bit's important. The qwerty layout was designed for the convenience of telegraph operators transcribing Morse code - that's why, for example, the Z is next to the S and the E, because Z and SE are indistinguishable in American Morse code. The telegraph receiver would hover over those letters, waiting for context to make everything clear. So the qwerty keyboard wasn't designed to be slow. But it wasn't designed for the convenience of you and me, either. So why do we still use it? The simple answer is that qwerty won a battle for dominance in the 1880s. Sholes' design was taken up by the gunsmiths E Remington and Sons. They finalised the layout and put it on the market for $125 - perhaps $3,000 (£2,271) in today's money, many months' income for the secretaries who would have used it. It wasn't the only typewriter around - Sholes has been described as the ""52nd man to invent the typewriter"" - but the qwerty keyboard emerged victorious. The Remington company cannily provided qwerty typing courses, and when it merged with four major rivals in 1893, they all adopted what became known as ""the universal layout"". And this brief struggle for market dominance in 1880s America determines the keyboard layout on today's iPads. Nobody then was thinking about our interests - but their actions control ours. And that's a shame, because more logical layouts exist: notably the Dvorak, designed by August Dvorak and patented in 1932. It favours the dominant hand (left and right-hand layouts are available) and puts the most-used keys together. The US Navy conducted a study in the 1940s demonstrating that the Dvorak was vastly superior: training typists to use the Dvorak layout would pay for itself many times over. So why didn't we all switch to Dvorak? The problem lay in co-ordinating the switch. Qwerty had been the universal layout since before Dvorak was born. Most typists trained on it. Any employer investing in a costly typewriter would naturally choose the layout that most typists could use, especially when economies of scale made it the cheapest model on the market. Dvorak keyboards never stood a chance. So now we start to see why this case matters. Many economists argue qwerty is the quintessential example of something they call ""lock in"". This isn't really about typewriters. It's about Microsoft Office and Windows, Amazon's control of the online retail link between online buyers and sellers, and Facebook's dominance of social media. More things that made the modern economy: How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff What leaded petrol says about the limits of regulation? How the plough changed everything How Ikea's Billy bookcase took over the world If all your friends are on Facebook apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp, doesn't that lock you in as surely as a qwerty typist? This matters. The lock-in is the friend of monopolists, the enemy of competition, and may require a robust response from regulators. But maybe dominant standards are dominant not because of lock-in, but just because the alternatives simply aren't as compelling as we imagine. Consider the famous Navy study that demonstrated the superiority of the Dvorak keyboard. Two economists, Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis, unearthed that study, and concluded it was badly flawed. They also raised an eyebrow at the name of the man who supervised it - the Navy's leading time-and-motion expert, one Lieutenant-Commander… August Dvorak. Liebowitz and Margolis don't deny that the Dvorak design may be better: the world's fastest alphanumeric typists do use Dvorak's layout. In 2008, Barbara Bradford was recorded maintaining a speed of 150 words per minute (wpm) for 50 minutes, and reached a top speed of 212 wpm using such a keyboard. But they were just not convinced that this was ever an example where an entire society was desperate to switch to a hugely superior standard yet unable to co-ordinate. And in fact these days, most of us peck away at our own emails, on devices which can actually let you switch your keyboard layout. Windows, iOS and Android all offer Dvorak layouts. You no longer need to persuade your co-workers, other employers and secretarial schools to switch with you. If you want it, you can just use it. Nobody else is even going to notice. Yet most of us stick with qwerty. The door is no longer locked, but we can't be bothered to escape. Lock-in seems to be entrenching the position of some of the most powerful and valuable companies in the world today - including Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. Maybe those locks are as unbreakable as the qwerty standard once seemed. Or maybe they risk being crow-barred off if restless consumers are tempted by something better. After all, it wasn't that long ago that people worried about users being locked in to MySpace.

"By Juliana LiuHong Kong correspondent, BBC News Hong Kong's best-known lesbian, Gigi Chao, whose billionaire father famously offered $100m (£60m) to any man in the world who can marry her, said the refusal was a ""disgrace"". ""Yes, we are disappointed, but the news is not unexpected as this former colony is clearly intent on governing from the depths of denial and siding with the populist ochlocracy [mob rule] of homophobic groups,"" she says. She says she hopes the right will be extended, but it may not be so simple, legally speaking. After years of debate, same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in March. Starting in June, the legislation was extended to cover British nationals overseas. British embassies and consulates are allowed to conduct same-sex marriages for couples in which at least one partner is a UK national. The marriage service is offered only in countries where gay marriage is not normally allowed, and can only take place if the host government does not object. ""Unfortunately, the Hong Kong government has raised an objection to the solemnisation of same-sex marriages in Hong Kong,"" said a spokeswoman at the British consulate. Countries seen as less cosmopolitan and progressive than Hong Kong have allowed the marriages. They include the Philippines, Vietnam, Russia and even mainland China, whose domestic policies are generally run separately from Hong Kong. Australia, under the socially conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott, has agreed to allow the ceremonies to go ahead, even though the marriages would not be legally recognised. When asked, the protocol department of the Hong Kong government declined to comment directly on its objection. ""It would be for individual consulates general to decide what functions and services they would wish to provide their nationals,"" it said in a statement. ""Although Hong Kong does not have laws on same-sex marriage, the government is firmly committed to promoting equal opportunities on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity."" The controversy comes in the same week that gay and lesbian rights activists like Ms Chao are preparing to launch the Pink Dot rally in Hong Kong. Sexual minorities and their families and friends have been invited to the public event, featuring free concerts by some of the city's well-known gay and lesbian entertainers. The Pink Dot movement actually began in 2009 in Singapore, another former British colony where UK nationals will not be allowed to marry their same-sex partners.",英国官员星期一（9日）说，香港政府拒绝允许同性恋伴侣在香港的英国领事馆举行婚礼，这一举动遭到香港同性恋权益团体的猛烈批评。,许多国家不承认同性恋婚姻 英国外交部上周宣布，他们将允许英国海外机构为在海外的英国人和他们的同性伴侣在当地举行婚礼。 当然，这要取决于当地政府的许可。 包括中国、俄罗斯、阿塞拜疆以及保守天主教国家菲律宾都允许这样做，尽管这些国家对同性恋的态度受到批评。 英国总领事馆的一名发言人对法新社表示，英国允许同性婚姻法律在本月初生效前曾向香港政府提出请求，希望他们允许在香港的英国领事馆为同性伴侣举行婚礼仪式。 “但不幸的是，香港政府对此提出反对”，该声明说。 香港的同性恋团体对港府的这一决定表示了不满和愤怒。 香港同性权益组织“粉红联盟”指责港府“拒绝给同性恋者增加任何权利”。 该组织表示，香港政府的做法实属愚蠢，就连北京和莫斯科都对不关自己公民的事采取了明智之举。 据信，包括澳大利亚、日本、智利、玻利维亚、塞尔维亚等20几个国家同意英国在他们国家的领事馆为同性恋伴侣举行婚礼，尽管同性婚姻在这些国家是非法。 在社会比较保守的香港，同性婚姻以及同性伴侣关系都是非法的。香港直到1991年才取消了同性恋是犯罪行为的法律。 2012年，香港富豪赵世曾曾出资6500万美元为同性恋的女儿赵式芝招婿， 后来又加价为1亿3000万美元。但最后不得不在今年初在其女儿的恳求下撤回了“征婚广告”。 赵式芝请求他父亲给与她和她的伴侣“正常和有尊严的人”的待遇。 编译：凯露
"While most students are happy with their course, dissatisfaction has grown since fees rose for English students, according to researchers for Which? and the Higher Education Policy Institute. The study highlights a big variation in teaching time, with students at some universities getting twice as much as those doing the same subject elsewhere. The BBC News website has gathered a range of viewpoints. Katharine Collins, second-year Childcare Studies student The course content has been very interesting, but I was expecting a little more one-to-one time with my tutors, a little more guidance. I probably get about 10 minutes a week one-to-one time with a tutor. I was one of the last students before the fees trebled, but at £3,000 a year, my course is still not cheap. I would like a bit more for my money really. We have lectures and seminars. Most of the time there are over 20 of us. So we need one-to-one tutor time to make sure we are getting on OK. We do about four assignments each term, each of about 3,000 words. Sometimes when they teach us generically it's not all that helpful. We're also supposed to be given written feedback after every assignment, but we had no feedback at all throughout the first year. We are given our grades about three weeks after we hand the assignments in - but this is just a percentage. There is no feedback on where we have gone wrong or how we might improve. Earlier this term we were suddenly handed back all our assignments from last year with things written on them. There were some errors, for example with referencing, that I kept making because no-one told me I was doing it wrong. I want to do postgraduate teacher training once I have finished my third year. I will go somewhere else to do that. I picked the course because of its reputation and because the prospectus indicated that we would be taught by published writers. There is a lack of one-to-one teaching. I would like personalised feedback from an expert in my field of writing. Some of the lectures have been quite helpful but they try to cater for too many different styles of writing - for instance if you want to be a poet you might find that the lectures focus too much on the novel. I think there is too much attention given to sharing our work in workshops and giving each other feedback. I think there should be more time given to actual teaching, rather than on feedback from people who are at a similar level to me. I don't think I am being taught enough of the craft. University should be more about learning. I could get similar feedback outside university if I got a group of writerly friends together and created a workshop in a local cafe. University was always something I was open to. Both my parents had gone to Newcastle and had loved it and I was certain that's where I wanted to go. When I started my A-levels, teachers started asking the inevitable questions: ""Which course did I want to study?"", ""Which university?"", ""Had I set up my Ucas [Universities and Colleges Admissions Service registration] yet?"" Tuition fees had just gone up and I was still struggling to find a course that I wanted to study. There were thousands to choose from and I was so confused. After I received my AS-level results, I still hadn't picked what I wanted to do and, although my grades were similar to many of my friends, I was disappointed with them and wasn't sure I wanted to go through endless retakes. Eventually, after really thinking it through, I realised university simply wasn't the right option for me. There was nothing I really wanted to study and to spend over £50,000 on a course I didn't love, seemed like a complete waste of money. Whenever I explain my decision to friends or family, they often reply with the same response, that I won't be paid as much as a graduate. The truth is, having done endless research, most companies and businesses value someone with work experience and ambition as much as they do a graduate. In fact if anything, I have the potential to be making more money than my friends once they leave university, and I won't have a huge debt to pay off. I set up Uni's Not For Me because I found there was so little advice and guidance for those trying to make a decision about university. Schools often don't mention alternatives to uni so it's drummed into students that university is the only acceptable route and often people feel like they're ""failing"" if they don't go. My ambition is that my site will provide awareness of all the options available, and tell the stories of people who have gone on to do amazing things and have very successful careers without a degree. The site is also aimed at teachers and parents to reassure them life can be perfectly OK if university is not part of the equation. What is clear from this, and other surveys, is that students are demanding more than ever from their universities, particularly with the increase in fees. With this, comes a need to ensure that prospective students, and often, parents, are getting all the right information about individual courses before they enrol. Universities have responded to this challenge and have worked hard to increase the amount of information on every course. New ""key information sets"" give prospective students standardised information for all undergraduate courses on things like fees, satisfaction rates for the course, course structure and employment prospects for graduates. While basic information about contact time for individual courses might be useful, attempts to rank courses at different institutions, based often on crude contact time samples, is not helpful or useful for prospective students. For example, it would be clear that a degree in a subject like history would place more emphasis on independent and guided research, whereas a lab-based subject would place a greater emphasis on direct, structured contact time with lecturers. The UK university system, one of the strongest in the world, is very diverse and complex and it is difficult to make these sorts of comparisons in such a broad way. And while there may be occasions when a student finds their course is not right for them, we must not forget that the vast majority of students are satisfied and satisfaction rates across all universities remain high. The important thing, if a problem occurs, is learning lessons. Universities are acting on responses to the National Student Survey on issues such as providing feedback to students. So does going to university represent value for money? Despite the difficult economic climate, graduates from UK universities remain highly valued by employers, here and overseas. Recent official figures confirmed that, on average, degree holders continue to earn considerably more than non-graduates over a working lifetime. The kinds of skills that higher education provides, the ability to think critically and to analyse and present evidence, are going to be increasingly in demand as our economy continues to shift. And let us not forget about all the other benefits such as mixing with people from all walks of life and corners of the globe, making life-long friendships, raising expectations and aspirations and developing a range of other skills along the way. It can be really life-changing. Ella, 16 When I work independently, I feel I have more freedom to develop my ideas and come up with more original viewpoints. The price of university will still be worth it to get the qualifications necessary for better jobs. Most of the people who disapprove of going to university have never tried university life so wouldn't know the benefits. Kieran, 16 If you want a job that needs a degree, then of course it is worth going to university. It's OK to do independent work, but the interaction of being able to ask your teacher what you are finding difficult would be lost. I like to be able to ask the teacher questions and have them help me to learn. It would affect my understanding of what I am learning and my overall achievements. Tyler, 16 Although the cost of university is very high now, I feel as though university is required for gaining a good, well paid job. People who tell me that university is not worth it, do make me think about the costs and other career options, however it does not change my opinion overall. Choosing your own way to learn could be very effective. (BBC School Report) Tripled tuition fees in England have done little more than replace slashed public funding for universities, so despite all that extra money paid by the students, universities have little scope to make genuine improvements to the student learning experience, and are struggling to keep pace with international competitors. The 2012-13 World University Rankings presented further evidence that many of our superb universities risk a slow slide into global mediocrity. The rankings showed some of the UK's most famous university names, Bristol, Sheffield, Leeds, Birmingham and Newcastle, sliding down the international league tables, while top universities in countries that are investing in their universities, especially in East Asia, continued a steady march up the rankings. As students in England increasingly begin to question the value for money they receive for their £9,000 tuition fees, other countries are willing and able to offer attractive alternatives. Strong campaigns to attract English students to more highly ranked institutions in the Netherlands, Germany, France and Canada have already seen some success. How long will it be until the steady trickle of British students deserting English universities for better and often cheaper options abroad turns into a flood? The rationale for surveying students in their first year is highly questionable and the findings take no account of the outcomes of the changing funding regimes to which universities have been subject to in the last seven years. When tuition fees were increased to £3,000 they were backed by state loans but the primary aim was to provide additional resources to universities. At the same time the government supported a national 'Aim Higher' access and outreach programme, restored maintenance grants to some students and provided institutions with additional funding to help with the costs of teaching part-time students. However, after the 2008 financial crisis there were some cuts to teaching funding which universities were required to manage. Fast forward to 2012 when fees were tripled, albeit also backed by a state loan, to cover a huge cut in university funding. The part-time institutional premium has also been abolished and universities are now required to use fee income to support a wide range of outreach programmes previously funded by government. In fact the survey confirms that students at modern universities are more likely to study in smaller groups and be taught by academics. There is no room for complacency but the fact remains that universities have done remarkably well to hold their own bearing in mind the funding roller coaster to which they and students have been subject in recent years. Government reforms are asking students to think more like consumers, while denying those who are dissatisfied any way of holding their institution to account. The information given to students and the way it is presented makes it very hard for students to make informed decisions, and universities are often far from transparent about the additional costs of studying. It is very difficult for a student to transfer from one institution to another, taking their course credits with them, and virtually impossible for a student to get a refund when they've been let down by an institution. The whole system of... tuition fees sets up unsavoury ideas about education as a financial transaction rather than a collaborative learning process that has value to students and society that extends way beyond the financial value of a degree certificate. The government needs to undo its shambolic changes to higher education and find a better way for graduates to contribute towards the education system, halting the marketisation of universities that is of no benefit to students or society.",根据最新调查，1/3的受访学生认为英国大学课程质量欠佳。,调查发现许多学生不满学校的授课质量 这项调查是由消费者权利监督组织《Which?》和英国高等教育政策研究所共同进行的。调查人员说英格兰大学生的学费上涨到9000英镑，令越来越多的学生感到不满。 调查报告还特别指出，各大学授课时间长短不一，有些大学的授课时间是其他大学同样科系学生的两倍。这种情况会影响到学生的学习效果和成绩。 报告说，去年秋季开始的调涨学费使得各大学面临压力，必须做到而且是看得见地做到让学生觉得上课是物超所值。 报告敦促说，应该立即调查与教学标准相关的问题。 今年年初在英国各地受访的17000名大学生当中，有29%说他们的课程不值得收那么高的学费，而在2006年、学费为每年1000英镑时，只有16%的学生认为大学课程是货次价高。 报告也指出，那些与教师面对面接触较少的学生，对课程觉得货次价高的可能性大约是其他学生的3倍。 许多受访学生也表示他们需要自己读书温习功课的时间增加了，自修时间从2006年的每周12小时48分钟增加到2013年受访时的14小时8分钟。 65%的受访学生说人数最多不超过5个人的小组教学，效果最好。 三成多的受访学生表示，如果事先能够了解更多有关学业的信息，或许他们会选择不一样的课程。 21%的受访学生说，学校所提供的信息非常模糊；近一成的受访学生说学校提供的信息是误导学生。 与内文相关的链接 相关话题
