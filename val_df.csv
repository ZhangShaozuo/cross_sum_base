"Sir Tim Berners-Lee told the Guardian that the practice undermined efforts to fight cybercrime and cyberwarfare. He called for a ""full and frank public debate"" on internet surveillance. It comes as a parliamentary committee has quizzed the heads of the UK's spying agencies - GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 - together in public for the first time. Security weakened Sir Tim said the system of checks and balances to oversee GCHQ and its US counterpart the National Security Agency (NSA) had failed. Details about intelligence work carried out by the agencies and reported in the Guardian have been leaked by US whistle-blower Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor. Sir Tim said the agencies had weakened online security by cracking the encryption employed by internet users to protect their data privacy. He also said it was a betrayal of the technology industry. ""Whistle-blowers, and responsible media outlets that work with them, play an important role in society,"" he said. ""We need powerful agencies to combat criminal activity online - but any powerful agency needs checks and balances and, based on recent revelations, it seems the current system of checks and balances has failed,"" he said. Sir Tim said media coverage of the Snowden leaks ""has been in the public interest and has uncovered many important issues which now need a full and frank public debate"". Meanwhile a group of Conservative MPs has urged the Guardian to take responsibility for the security implications of reporting the information and ""act accordingly"". In their letter, 28 Tory MPs said publishing the leaks in such detail ""runs the risk of compromising the vital work of the institutions, processes and people who protect the safety of this country"". They asked the newspaper's editor, Alan Rusbridger, to discuss with the intelligence services the implications for national security that publication would have, and be explicit about any information they have released that could threaten the safety of intelligence services personnel. 'Significant step' Highlighting security risks that might occur if information intended for journalists fell into the hands of terrorists or ""hostile foreign powers"", the MPs also urged the paper to be open with the government and security agencies about exactly what information it had shared, and with whom. ""We are asking you to do no more than to share with our intelligence services, the very people who protect the freedoms which the Guardian champions, that which you have already shared freely with international bloggers and journalists who have no concept of the UK national interest,"" they said. Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) has questioned GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban, MI5 director general Andrew Parker and MI6 chief Sir John Sawers. Mr Parker took over as head of the security service MI5 earlier this year. MI6 is charged with gathering intelligence and GCHQ with monitoring communications. Intelligence chiefs have given evidence to the committee in private for many years. The session was shown on the BBC News Channel, with a short time delay to prevent anything that might endanger national security or the safety of those working for the agencies being broadcast. The ISC, made up of senior MPs and peers, said the committee meeting was ""a very significant step forward in terms of the openness and transparency of the agencies"".",互联网发明人、英国计算机科学家蒂姆·伯纳斯-李说，英美间谍机构破解网络密码进行监控是“骇人听闻和愚蠢的”。,蒂姆·伯纳斯-李表示，任何强大的机构都需要制衡。 伯纳斯-李对英国《卫报》表示，这种监控做法破坏了对网络犯罪和网络攻击的打击。 他呼吁就网络监控进行“全面和坦率的公开辩论”。 《卫报》的这一采访发表之际，英国议会“情报与安全委员会”正准备对英国政府通讯总部首脑洛班爵士、军情五处处长帕克和六处处长萨瓦斯爵士三名英国情报机构首脑进行史无前例的公开质询。 伯纳斯-李说，监管和平衡英国政府通讯总部和美国国家安全局的系统失灵了。 削弱安全 9月份，据《卫报》公布的前美国国家安全局雇员斯诺登的文件显示了英美情报机构对网络的监控细节。 伯纳斯-李说，这些情报机构破解了互联网用户保护隐私的网络密码，削弱了网络安全。他也将之称为对科技业的背叛。 他说：“揭发内幕者，以及和他们合作的媒体都在社会里发挥着重要作用。” 他指出，“我们需要强大的机构对付网络犯罪，但任何强大的机构都需要制衡。从近期曝光的情况看，这个制衡机制已经失灵。” 他表示，媒体对斯诺登泄露的情况的报道一直是符合公众利益的，并且揭露了“很多需要全面和坦率的公开辩论的问题”。 与此同时，28名英国保守党议员们敦促《卫报》“采取相应措施”，就其报道对安全的影响负责，特别是考虑到如果有关信息落入恐怖分子或者“敌对外国势力”之手会造成的风险。 （编译：立行 责编：铃兰） 网友如有评论，请用下表：
"Rescue missions and aid material have started arriving in the country. Seventeen people have been killed on Mt Everest by avalanches - the mountain's worst-ever disaster. Meanwhile a powerful aftershock was felt on Sunday in Nepal, India and Bangladesh, and more avalanches were reported near Everest. The 6.7-magnitude tremor, centred 60km (40 miles) east of Nepal's capital Kathmandu, sent people running in panic for open ground in the city. At the scene: By Surendra Phuyal, BBC News, Kathmandu As military helicopters hovered over Kathmandu and ferried relief supplies to victims of the earthquake in western Nepal, search and rescue efforts were going on in at least five locations in Kathmandu. Near the prime minister's official residence, two bulldozers scoured the rubble of a flattened four-storey house. A bystander said it was the local tax office. The bodies of the four staff inside had been recovered minutes before. As the search and road-clearing efforts got under way at noon, a major aftershock sent people into a panic again. At a nearby open space, people were camped out fearing further tremors. They were short of food and water - clearly hoping and praying that the aftershocks would stop and things would be normal soon. The death toll from the original earthquake on Saturday could rise, as the situation is unclear in remote areas which remain cut off or hard to access. Many mountain roads are cracked or blocked by landslides. Scores of bodies have been ferried to hospitals in Kathmandu, many of which are struggling to cope with the number of injured. More than 700 have died in the capital alone. Tents have been set up in a parade ground in the city centre to house thousands of people displaced by the earthquake. Medics are expecting a fresh influx of patients on Sunday as supplies run low. Rescuers used their bare hands in places to dig for survivors still buried underneath piles of rubble and debris overnight on Saturday. Army officer Santosh Nepal told the Reuters news agency that he and his soldiers had to dig a passage into a collapsed three-storey residential building in Kathmandu using pickaxes because bulldozers could not get through the ancient city's narrow streets. ""We believe there are still people trapped inside,"" he told Reuters. The 7.8-magnitude quake struck an area of central Nepal between Kathmandu and the city of Pokhara on Saturday morning. There were also victims in India, Bangladesh and in the Chinese region of Tibet. It is the worst earthquake in Nepal since 1934, when some 8,500 people were killed. Analysis - BBC Science correspondent Jonathan Amos Large quakes are generally followed by a flurry of aftershocks, which tend to reduce in strength and frequency as time goes on. As a rule of thumb, seismologists might expect to see at least one aftershock that measures roughly a magnitude less than the main shock. One of these, with a Magnitude of 6.6, was seen just half an hour after Saturday's main 7.8 event. Sunday has now experienced a further big aftershock of 6.7. From the early data, the tremor looks to have originated closer to the surface than Saturday's big shakers. Although each step down on the magnitude scale is a 30-times drop in the energy released, Sunday's big aftershock will not have felt like that for those on the ground. And, of course, it may have toppled many already severely damaged buildings, adding to the difficulties of the rescue operation. Nepal's architectural jewels destroyed Why Nepal is so vulnerable to quakes Challenges of Nepal's quake relief operation 'Moment of crisis' ""We have launched a massive rescue and rehabilitation action plan and lots needs to be done,"" Information and Broadcasting Minister Minendra Rijal told Indian television. ""Our country is in a moment of crisis and we will require tremendous support and aid."" . Scores of people slept outside on Saturday night - braving wet and cold weather - either because their homes were destroyed or because they feared numerous aftershocks. World leaders and global charities have offered emergency aid to Nepal, as the government grapples with the scale of the disaster. India is at the forefront of the relief effort, offering help including helicopters which have been deployed to remote areas. The United States, Britain, China, Pakistan and European Union countries are among those who have pledged aid. A number of international charities including Red Cross, Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders and Christian Aid are also sending teams to quake-hit areas. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was especially worried about the fate of villages near the epicentre of the quake, some 80km (50 miles) from Kathmandu. 'Rubble and landslides' The problems have been compounded by erratic internet and mobile phone communications. British Red Cross spokeswoman Penny Sims said it was hard to get an accurate picture of what is going on. ""A lot of the roads are blocked, there's rubble, there's been landslides as well... So that is going to make the aid effort very difficult,"" she told the BBC. Foreign climbers and their Nepalese guides around Mt Everest were caught by the tremors and a huge avalanche. As well as the 17 confirmed deaths, 61 people were injured when part of the base camp was buried under snow. Helicopters trying to airlift the injured to Kathmandu were delayed by cloudy weather, but have now managed to rescue most of them. Dan Fredinburg, a Google executive who described himself as an adventurer, was among the dead, Google confirmed. Are you in the area? Are you affected by the earthquake?

"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Experts estimate the toll includes thousands of Britons each year. The British Heart Foundation, which funded The Lancet work, says the UK must clean up its air - many of its cities often exceed safe levels set by the European Union. The government has already admitted that in 15 regions, air quality will breach EU limits until 2020. But Defra says it is committed to improving air quality and that most parts of the UK meet EU air quality limits for all pollutants. Air pollution, largely from traffic fumes, has previously been linked to heart attacks but not heart failure. This happens when the heart muscle becomes weak and less good at its job of pumping blood around the body. It is often the consequence of a heart attack and affects more than 750,000 people in the UK. Deep into lungs The Lancet research looked at 35 studies with data for thousands of patients in 12 countries, including the UK, the US and China. The strongest link was found with gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, as well as fine particulate air pollution - fumes from buses, taxis and lorries that can get deep into the lungs and, from there, into the bloodstream. People with already weakened hearts who were exposed to high levels, by living near to or travelling along busy roads, for example, were particularly susceptible. And the increased risk seems to be strongest on the day of exposure. Dr Anoop Shah and colleagues who carried out the work say moderate reductions in air pollution could avoid 8,000 US hospital admissions for heart failure each year. ""There's no reason why the impact wouldn't be similar in the UK."" Alan Andrews of the lobby group Client Earth said: ""The UK has a big problem with air pollution, particularly from road traffic, and the government response sadly has been worse than useless."" He said people should be alerted when pollution levels are high so that they can take measures to protect themselves, by staying indoors when possible and avoiding busy roads. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution in towns and cities kills 1.3 million people globally each year. UK estimates suggest nearly 30,000 people die prematurely each year as a direct result of exposure to air pollution. Air pollution has been linked to asthma and other lung diseases, including cancer, as well as heart problems. The Chief Medical Officer recently highlighted the impact of air pollution in her first annual report on the state of the nation's health - air pollution was highlighted among the top 10 causes of mortality in the UK.",一项大规模国际调查称，空气污染对心脏衰弱的人威胁最大，甚至可能导致死亡。,在英国，每年因空气污染导致心脏衰竭的死亡数以千计 专家估计，在英国，每年因空气污染导致心脏衰竭的死亡数以千计。 英国心脏基金会呼吁政府清洁空气，说英国许多城市的空气质量经常超过欧盟制定的安全标准。 英国政府承认，至少有15个地区，空气质量超过欧盟的安全标准，而且超标的状况要持续到2020年。 国际权威医学杂志《柳叶刀》对包括英国、美国和中国在内的12个国家的35项专题研究进行了综合分析。 研究发现，车辆排放的废气和空气粉尘等空气污染与心脏疾病之间有明显的联系。 废气吸入肺部后进入血液循环。心脏衰弱的人如果暴露在高空气污染的环境中，比如住在繁忙道路的旁边，受到的威胁更大。 此前的研究已将空气污染与心肌梗塞联系起来，它也可能导致心脏衰竭这还是第一次。 空气污染 健康杀手 参加研究的沙恩博士说，在美国，适当的减少空气污染的措施每年让8000人避免了因心脏衰竭而住院。 他说，人们应该对空气污染水平保持警觉，以便采取措施自我保护，比如避免出门或躲开繁忙路段。 据世界卫生组织的估计，城镇空气污染导致全球每年130万人死亡。 英国估计，空气污染直接导致的早死每年有3万人。 除了心脏疾病，空气污染还与哮喘和其它肺部疾病，包括癌症有直接联系。 （编译：腾龙 责编：路西）
"It won every award it was nominated for - including best musical or comedy film, best director, screenplay, score and song. Its stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling also won in the acting categories. The Globes are seen as pointers to the Oscars. Moonlight was named best drama film, while Casey Affleck and Isabelle Huppert won other acting prizes. British actors also enjoyed a golden night in the TV categories, with prizes for The Night Manager and The Crown. Affleck was named best actor in a film drama for his role in Manchester By The Sea and French star Huppert was the surprise winner of the award for best film drama actress. Her performance in thriller Elle - which was also named best foreign language film - beat contenders including Natalie Portman, who had been considered the favourite for playing Jackie Kennedy in Jackie. Viola Davis was named best supporting film actress for playing a woman in 1950s Pittsburgh in Fences - a role she first played on Broadway six years ago. The movie is an adaptation of the August Wilson play, which explores race relations in post-war America. Accepting the award, Davis said: ""It's not every day that Hollywood thinks of translating a play to screen - it doesn't scream 'moneymaker'. But it does scream art, and it does scream heart."" In a surprise result, British actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson was named best supporting actor for his role in Nocturnal Animals - a prize that had been widely expected to go to Mahershala Ali for Moonlight. Zootopia was named best animated feature film at Sunday's ceremony, which was hosted by Jimmy Fallon. The comedian's opening monologue was less risque than those of some of his predecessors, but he still found time to make light of the divisive year in US politics. The talk show host joked that the Golden Globes ceremony was ""one of the few places left where America still honours the popular vote"" - a reference to Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton in the recent US election despite getting fewer votes overall. He also described grief-stricken film Manchester By The Sea as ""the only thing more depressing than 2016"". The ceremony featured several references to Mr Trump - not least when Meryl Streep launched an attack on the US President-elect while accepting the Cecil B Demille award for outstanding contribution to entertainment. Streep referred to Trump's mocking of a disabled reporter and said: ""Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose."" There were several British triumphs in the television categories, including wins for Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman for The Night Manager. Claire Foy also won best actress in a television series for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix's The Crown.

"The pyramid-shaped building has become known as the ""Hotel of Doom"". The chief executive of the Kempinski group, which will manage the Ryugyong hotel, said only 150 rooms on the top floors would be used as a hotel. Reto Wittwer said shops, restaurants and offices would eventually open on the lower levels. Construction on the building began in 1987. It is the 47th tallest building in the world, at 330m (1,100ft), and has the fifth greatest number of floors, 105. Abandoned It was scheduled to be completed in 1989 in time for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students. But construction was abandoned in 1992 when North Korea suffered an economic crisis. Its hulking, unfinished presence has long been an embarrassment for the North Korean leadership, analysts say. It was voted ""Worst Building in the History of Mankind"" by Esquire magazine in 2008. The American publication called it ""hideously ugly, even by communist standards."" There are reports of poor construction and the use of inferior materials. A delegation from the European Union Chamber of Commerce in Korea, which inspected the building almost 15 years ago, concluded it was beyond repair and its lift shafts crooked. But in 2008 an Egyptian company, Orascom Telecom, which operates a mobile phone network in North Korea, began equipping the building. 'Multi-storey carpark' It is reported to have spent $180m (£112m) on finishing the hotel's facade. Mr Wittwer said the hotel will ""partially, probably"" open for business next year. But original plans for 3,000 hotel rooms and three revolving restaurants have been greatly scaled back. Earlier this year, the Beijing-based company, Koryo Tours, which organises trips to North Korea, was granted a rare glimpse inside the hotel. Photos taken by the company showed a vast glass-covered lobby and atrium with tiers of bare concrete at its base, resembling a multi-storey car park.",位于朝鲜首都平壤的地标性建筑柳京饭店据信将于明年开业，从而结束这座26年的烂尾楼令朝鲜领导人难堪的历史。,这座金字塔形的建筑在世界建筑高度排名中列第47位 国际酒店联盟凯宾斯基集团将负责这座大楼的管理。集团公司总裁威特沃说，饭店会在明年部分开放，首先开放的只有高层的150间饭店客房。 他还说，大楼的低层未来会作为商店、餐厅和办公室最终投入使用。 始建于1987年的柳京饭店有105层，是一座金字塔形的建筑，原计划在1989年举行第13届世界青年学生联欢节时竣工。但工程未能按时完成，并且在1992年朝鲜遭遇经济危机时被迫停工。 人类历史上最糟糕的建筑 柳京饭店曾在2008年被美国Esquire杂志评选为人类历史上最糟糕的建筑，并形容这座建筑即便用共产党的标准衡量也过于丑陋。 还有报道说，柳京饭店大厦的建造施工质量低下，工程中使用了劣质材料。 欧洲联盟韩国商会的一个代表团曾在15年前视察过这座建筑，并得出结论说，这座烂尾楼无法修复，大楼电梯井也出现变形。 但是在2008年，同时在朝鲜经营移动电话网络的埃及Orascom通讯公司开始继续大楼的装修。据报道，这家公司为完成大楼的门面花费了1.8亿美元。 虽然柳京饭店现在看来可以最终投入使用，但最初提出的3000间客房和3个旋转餐厅的设计规模将会缩小。 与内文相关的链接 相关新闻话题
"Sunday's missile launch was a successful one and it demonstrated North Korea's longest-range nuclear-capable weapon yet. Accompanying photographs showed it to be the same missile on parade last month at a massive military parade to mark the birth anniversary of North Korea's founding father Kim Il-sung. Current leader Kim Jong-un was on-site according to photos released from North Korean state media KCNA and Rodong Sinmun. In the hours afterwards, the statistics of the launch perplexed some observers, even to the point of questioning the data. With tensions high, US Pacific Command was careful to categorise the flight as ""not consistent with an intercontinental ballistic missile"", which is - in short - one which could reach the US mainland. One step further This ""mystery"" missile is now revealed to be a powerful intermediate range missile, which North Korea claims can deliver a large and heavy nuclear warhead. This vague statement leaves the door open to a range of possibilities, including that North Korea has not been able to make a compact warhead, or even that a new warhead will be revealed in the future. North Korean state media said the missile had been launched over the country and into the sea east of the Korean Peninsula 787km (489 miles) away from its launch site near Kusong. It reached an altitude of 2,111.1km according to KCNA. These figures fit approximately with statements made by both American and Japanese officials monitoring the situation. While unusual, this sharp trajectory with an extremely high altitude allowed North Korean scientists to test the range of the missile without directly flying over any neighbouring countries. The altitude would also allow the North to test the atmospheric re-entry vehicle under the extreme heat, pressure and vibration. The KCNA noted both facts in its public statement on Monday. This ""lofted"" trajectory would be equivalent to over 4,500km if launched at a standard trajectory, putting US bases in Guam well in range. It is indeed the longest-range missile North Korea has ever tested (aside from its space launch vehicles). Deeply disturbing Photographs indicate the Hwasong-12 to be a single stage, liquid-fuelled rocket, which would be unusually inefficient at this range due to the weight of the frame, fuel and oxidisers. One possibility is that the body of the rocket is intended to be one part of a larger multi-staged intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching well into the US mainland. In this way, North Korea can make iterative progress towards an ICBM without immediately crossing Trump's red line. The missile launch, occurring just days after the new South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office, is deeply disturbing to many observers. Missile testing under Kim Jong-un increased dramatically compared with his father and grandfather's programmes. This test marks the 10th test of 2017, and this particular missile shows a greater range than any other tested in its military programme. South Korea's new president has espoused dialogue with North Korea, and is now forced to take a tougher line just days into his administration. So once again North Korea, with its rapidly advancing missile technology and the decline in relations with its neighbours, including China, has left diplomats scratching their heads.

Swedish Academy officials previously said Dylan would not deliver his Nobel lecture, a traditional condition of receiving the 8m krona ($900,000, £727,000) prize money, at the event. He is expected to deliver a taped version of the lecture later. If he does not deliver a lecture by June, he will have to forfeit the prize money. A member of the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, told the Associated Press news agency ""it went very well indeed"", and that 75-year-old Dylan was ""a very nice, kind man"". In an earlier blog post, the academy's secretary said the setting would be ""small and intimate"". No media were present at Dylan's request. After receiving the prize, Dylan performed a concert on Saturday evening at the Stockholm Waterfront venue. A second concert is planned for Sunday evening. The Nobel Prize for literature has usually been associated with poets and novelists. But the academy handed Dylan the prize ""for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition"". Dylan failed to attend the December ceremony, citing previous commitments. In a speech read on his behalf, he said it was ""truly beyond words"" and he thought his odds of winning were as likely ""standing on the moon"".

"They were not members of so-called Islamic State but had tried to make contact with the group, officials said. The justice minister said the group was in the planning stage of an attack and police acted as a preventative measure. Alexandre Moraes described the cell as ""absolute amateurs"" and ""ill-prepared"" to launch an attack. All those arrested were Brazilian and two more suspects were being sought, he said. They were detained across 10 different states, and had been in contact via messaging services such as Whatsapp. Group members had attempted to contact a weapons supplier in neighbouring Paraguay to get AK 47 assault rifles, but there was no evidence of any being bought. An emergency meeting of the Brazilian cabinet has been called. More than 80,000 police and soldiers will patrol Rio streets for the games which end on 21 August.

The International Olympic Committee recently concluded that Rio de Janeiro had overcome setbacks and was ""ready to welcome the world"" to the 2016 Olympics. There have been fears over Rio's readiness because of building delays, the Zika virus and political crises. Mr Moraes told a news conference there was a ""minimal probability of a terrorist act during the Rio Olympics.""",巴西警方拘捕10人，涉嫌准备在8月里约热内卢奥运期间发动恐怖袭击。巴西政府为此紧急召开内阁会议。,为了确保里约奥运会的安全，巴西当局部署65000名警察参与奥运安保工作，这使负责里约奥运安保的总人数达到80000人。 当局表示，嫌犯并不是极端组织“伊斯兰国”（IS）成员，但他们曾尝试同该组织联络。 当局说，一共有12人通过社交媒体宣誓效忠“伊斯兰国”。现在警方已经逮捕了10人，还有2人在逃。 目前距离里约热内卢奥运会只有两周左右的时间。 巴西司法部长亚历山大·莫赖斯在记者会上表示，上述团伙组织松散，“完全是业余的团伙，毫无准备”。 警方在10个不同州将这些疑犯逮捕，这些疑犯通过WhatsApp等即时通讯应用在网上联系，彼此并不认识。 据调查，该犯罪团伙成员均为巴西籍，设法通过巴拉圭的武器网站购买AK-47冲锋枪。但是没有证据显示嫌疑人已经买到这些武器。 巴拉圭是巴西和阿根廷共同的邻国，三个国家相邻的边界漏洞很多，是以洗钱、贩毒和走私军火横行闻名的地区。 为了确保里约奥运会的安全，巴西当局部署65000名警察参与奥运安保工作，这使负责里约奥运安保的总人数达到80000人。 巴西政府12日表示，为了满足里约奥运会的安保需求，他们将向巴西军队追加拨款2400万美元。 国际奥委会协调委员会主席穆塔瓦基勒最近表示，里约奥运会已做好准备。 此前，全球各大媒体因寨卡病毒、各大场馆工程延期、街头犯罪、政治危机和瓜纳巴拉海湾污染事件等风波对里约奥运不断提出批评。
"Italians have nicknamed him ""Forrest Gump"" on social media, after the slow-witted hero of a 1994 movie, played by Tom Hanks, who runs thousands of miles across the United States. Police stopped the Italian's epic walk at 2am in Fano on the Adriatic coast, a week after he left Como in the north. The man, 48, got a €400 (£362; $485) police fine for breaching the curfew. The story was first reported by the Bologna-based newspaper Il Resto del Carlino but quickly went viral in Italian media. Some comments on social media presented the man as heroic and criticised the fine. One said he should have been rewarded - not fined - and given a new pair of shoes. Another praised him for walking off to cool his anger, rather than resorting to violence. The man told police ""I came here on foot, I didn't use any transport"". He said ""along the way I met people who offered me food and drink"". ""I'm OK, just a bit tired,"" he said, having averaged 60km daily. Police found him wandering aimlessly and cold at night on a coastal highway. After checking his ID in their database they found that his wife had reported him missing, so they contacted her and she travelled to Fano to collect him. The Italian reports did not say how she reacted upon learning that he had picked up a €400 fine.

"By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent Taken by South African Brent Stirton, the picture shows the slumped form of a black rhino in Hluhluwe Imfolozi Game Reserve. Poachers killed the animal at night, with a silencer, and then dehorned it. Stirton took the photo as part of an investigation into the illegal trade in rhino products. The photographer visited more than 30 such crime scenes in the course of his probe - experiences he said he found depressing. ""My first child is going to be born in February; I'm 48. And I think I left it such a long time because I kind of lost faith in a lot of the work we see as photojournalists. You lose faith in humanity to some extent."" Stirton, who collected his award at a gala dinner at London's Natural History Museum, believes this particular piece of butchery was probably carried out by local people, but working to order. The usual practice is to sell the animal's two horns to a middleman. This individual then smuggles the merchandise out of South Africa, most probably through Mozambique, to China or Vietnam. In those Asian countries rhino horn has a street value higher than gold or cocaine. The trade is driven by the misguided belief that horn - the same material as toenails - can cure everything from cancer to kidney stones. Brent Stirton told BBC News: ""For me to win this, for the jury to acknowledge this kind of picture - it's illustrative that we are living in a different time now, that this is a real issue. The sixth age of extinction is a reality and rhinos are just one of many species that we are losing at a hugely accelerated rate and I am grateful that the jury would choose this image because it gives this issue another platform."" Lewis Blackwell, the chair of judges for WPY, said the rhino image had had a searing impact on his panel: ""People may be disgusted, they may be horrified - but it draws you in and you want to know more, you want to know the story behind it. And you can't escape it; it confronts you with what's going on in the world."" The rather more peaceful image of a young western lowland gorilla feeding on breadfruit is the subject of the Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year winning entry. This was taken by Daniël Nelson from the Netherlands, who entered the picture in the 15-17-years-old category. The gorilla is about nine years old and is called Caco by the trackers who took the young Dutchman to see the ape in Odzala National Park in the Republic of Congo. Western lowland gorillas are critically endangered. Their numbers are being denuded by illegal hunting for bushmeat, disease (notably the Ebola virus), and habitat loss (to mines and oil‑palm plantations). Daniël, who is now 18, said he first became aware of WPY when he was six. ""It inspired me immediately, and since then my passions in life have revolved around wildlife, photography and conservation."" Some of the other WPY category winners This image is called Contemplation, taken by Peter Delaney (Ireland/South Africa). It wins the Animal Portraits category. It shows a resting chimpanzee on the forest floor in Uganda's Kibale National Park. Peter is from County Wicklow but WPY inspired him to move to Africa to pursue his photography career. Crab surprise is the title of this picture from Justin Gilligan (Australia). It claimed the Invertebrates category. It shows an octopus choosing a meal in a field of giant spider crabs in Mercury Passage off the east coast of Tasmania. Tony Wu (US) calls this The giant gathering. It is the Behaviour: Mammals winner. Tony is a specialist in photographing sperm whales. This huge gathering was captured off Sri Lanka's northeast coast. Very rarely have such scenes been witnessed by cameras. This unusual photo is titled The ice monster. Laurent Ballesta (France) captured the scene in waters off East Antarctica, close to the French Dumont d'Urville scientific base. It shows the underside of an iceberg. It's actually a mosaic of many images stitched together. It won the Earth's Environments category. Palm-oil survivors is the work of Bertie Gekoski (UK/USA) - the winner of the Wildlife Photojournalist: Single image award. It is taken in eastern Sabah, on the island of Borneo. Three generations of Bornean elephants are seen moving across an oil-palm plantation being cleared for replanting. The palm oil industry has reduced and fragmented the animals' habitat. When the animals stray into plantations they often get shot or poisoned, says Bertie. The grip of the gulls, taken by Ekaterina Bee from Italy. Ekaterina is the winner in the 10 years and under category. She got these herring gulls to play for her camera by throwing some bread for them. Ekaterina is just five-and-a-half years old. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions of its type in world photography. Started in 1964 by what has since become BBC Wildlife Magazine, it has grown in scale and this year accepted 48,000 entries from 92 countries. The current competition is organised by London's Natural History Museum. An exhibition of the best images opens at the South Kensington institution on Friday. Next year's competition starts taking entries from Monday.

"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Experts estimate the toll includes thousands of Britons each year. The British Heart Foundation, which funded The Lancet work, says the UK must clean up its air - many of its cities often exceed safe levels set by the European Union. The government has already admitted that in 15 regions, air quality will breach EU limits until 2020. But Defra says it is committed to improving air quality and that most parts of the UK meet EU air quality limits for all pollutants. Air pollution, largely from traffic fumes, has previously been linked to heart attacks but not heart failure. This happens when the heart muscle becomes weak and less good at its job of pumping blood around the body. It is often the consequence of a heart attack and affects more than 750,000 people in the UK. Deep into lungs The Lancet research looked at 35 studies with data for thousands of patients in 12 countries, including the UK, the US and China. The strongest link was found with gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, as well as fine particulate air pollution - fumes from buses, taxis and lorries that can get deep into the lungs and, from there, into the bloodstream. People with already weakened hearts who were exposed to high levels, by living near to or travelling along busy roads, for example, were particularly susceptible. And the increased risk seems to be strongest on the day of exposure. Dr Anoop Shah and colleagues who carried out the work say moderate reductions in air pollution could avoid 8,000 US hospital admissions for heart failure each year. ""There's no reason why the impact wouldn't be similar in the UK."" Alan Andrews of the lobby group Client Earth said: ""The UK has a big problem with air pollution, particularly from road traffic, and the government response sadly has been worse than useless."" He said people should be alerted when pollution levels are high so that they can take measures to protect themselves, by staying indoors when possible and avoiding busy roads. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution in towns and cities kills 1.3 million people globally each year. UK estimates suggest nearly 30,000 people die prematurely each year as a direct result of exposure to air pollution. Air pollution has been linked to asthma and other lung diseases, including cancer, as well as heart problems. The Chief Medical Officer recently highlighted the impact of air pollution in her first annual report on the state of the nation's health - air pollution was highlighted among the top 10 causes of mortality in the UK.",一项大规模国际调查称，空气污染对心脏衰弱的人威胁最大，甚至可能导致死亡。,在英国，每年因空气污染导致心脏衰竭的死亡数以千计 专家估计，在英国，每年因空气污染导致心脏衰竭的死亡数以千计。 英国心脏基金会呼吁政府清洁空气，说英国许多城市的空气质量经常超过欧盟制定的安全标准。 英国政府承认，至少有15个地区，空气质量超过欧盟的安全标准，而且超标的状况要持续到2020年。 国际权威医学杂志《柳叶刀》对包括英国、美国和中国在内的12个国家的35项专题研究进行了综合分析。 研究发现，车辆排放的废气和空气粉尘等空气污染与心脏疾病之间有明显的联系。 废气吸入肺部后进入血液循环。心脏衰弱的人如果暴露在高空气污染的环境中，比如住在繁忙道路的旁边，受到的威胁更大。 此前的研究已将空气污染与心肌梗塞联系起来，它也可能导致心脏衰竭这还是第一次。 空气污染 健康杀手 参加研究的沙恩博士说，在美国，适当的减少空气污染的措施每年让8000人避免了因心脏衰竭而住院。 他说，人们应该对空气污染水平保持警觉，以便采取措施自我保护，比如避免出门或躲开繁忙路段。 据世界卫生组织的估计，城镇空气污染导致全球每年130万人死亡。 英国估计，空气污染直接导致的早死每年有3万人。 除了心脏疾病，空气污染还与哮喘和其它肺部疾病，包括癌症有直接联系。 （编译：腾龙 责编：路西）
"The Dalai Lama, who is visiting Rome, had requested a meeting. A Vatican spokesman said that although the Pope held him ""in very high regard"", the request had been declined ""for obvious reasons"". Correspondents say the Vatican does not want to jeopardise efforts to improve relations with China. China describes the Dalai Lama as a separatist and reacts angrily when foreign dignitaries meet him. The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after Chinese troops crushed an attempted uprising in Tibet. He now advocates a ""middle way"" with China, seeking autonomy but not independence for Tibet. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. ""Pope Francis obviously holds the Dalai Lama in very high regard but he will not be meeting any of the Nobel laureates,"" a Vatican spokesman said. He added that the Pope would send a video message to the conference. A spokesman for the Dalai Lama said he was ""disappointed at not being able to call on His Holiness the Pope but he does not want to cause any inconvenience"". Catholicism in China Analysts say the Vatican and China are at odds over control of the Catholic Church in China. The Chinese Communist Party oversees an official community, known as the Patriotic Association and believed to number about 12 million people, but there is also a much larger underground Church that is loyal to the Pope. A serious bone of contention between China and the Vatican is which side should have the final say in the appointment of bishops. A Vatican official said the Pope's decision was ""not taken out of fear but to avoid any suffering by those who have already suffered"". The last time the Dalai Lama was granted a papal audience was in 2006 when he met former Pope Benedict XVI. The Dalai Lama is in Rome for a meeting of Nobel Peace Prize winners. It was initially to be held in South Africa but was relocated to Rome after South Africa refused the Dalai Lama a visa.",罗马教廷说，罗马天主教皇方济各因为“同中国关系微妙”不会同西藏流亡精神领袖达赖喇嘛会面。正在罗马访问的达赖喇嘛提出了会见的要求。,中国和梵蒂冈的主要分歧是任命主教的最后决定权在哪一方 梵蒂冈发言人说，虽然教皇“十分尊重”达赖喇嘛，但由于“显而易见”的原因回绝了会见要求。 记者说，梵蒂冈不愿意破坏改善同中国关系的努力。中国认为达赖喇嘛是分裂分子，外国政要会见达赖喇嘛总引起中国愤怒的反应。 1959年西藏反叛遭到解放军镇压后，达赖喇嘛流亡印度。达赖喇嘛赞成“中间道路”，即寻求西藏真正的自治而不是独立。 达赖喇嘛在1989年获得诺贝尔和平奖。 达赖喇嘛在1989年获得诺贝尔和平奖。 分析人士说，梵蒂冈和中国就中国的天主教如何控制问题发生分歧。据信中国天主教徒多达1200万人。 中国的天主教分为对共产党负责的爱国天主教，和效忠梵蒂冈的地下教会。 中国和梵蒂冈的主要分歧是任命主教的最后决定权在哪一方。 上次达赖喇嘛会见教皇是在2006年，当时他会见了前任教皇本笃十六世。 达赖喇嘛目前在罗马参加一个诺贝尔和平奖得主的会议。本来这个会议订在南方召开，由于南非拒绝给达赖喇嘛发签证，会议转移到了罗马召开。 （编写/责编：横路）
"The Banksy mural, depicting a boy hunched over a sewing machine making Union Jack bunting, disappeared from Whymark Avenue earlier this month. It had been expected to be auctioned in Miami later but the auction house told the BBC the sale was halted. A new mural had appeared on the street wall where the image was removed. Slave Labour - the mural that was removed - appeared on the wall in Wood Green, north London, last May, shortly before the celebrations to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. It disappeared from the side of the Poundland store last weekend and had been expected to fetch up to £450,000 at auction in Miami. Fine Art Auctions Miami (FAAM) confirmed to the BBC that the Banksy mural had been withdrawn from sale. However, a spokesman gave no reason for its withdrawal. ""Although there are no legal issues whatsoever regarding the sale of lots six and seven by Banksy, FAAM convinced its consignors to withdraw these lots from the auction and take back the power of authority of these works,"" he said. 'Affection' and 'disappointment' Earlier, Haringey Council said it had learned that the sale was stopped at the last minute. Haringey Council Leader Claire Kober said it was ""a true credit to the community"" that their campaigning seemed to have ""helped to stop the sale of this artwork from going ahead"". ""We will continue to explore all options to bring back Banksy to the community where it belongs,"" she said. It appeared that a starting bid of $400,000 (£262,450) had been made before the auction of the artwork was halted. The new mural that appeared on the north London wall depicts a woman in a nun's habit, but it is not known if it is by Banksy. BBC Oxford producer Andy Gordon was visiting relatives on Saturday when he snapped the newest addition to Whymark Avenue in Haringey. ""We thought we were just going along to see the gap in the wall and were surprised to see something else had appeared. ""There was obviously a lot of affection for it in Wood Green and a lot of people were very disappointed when their Banksy disappeared."" He said the new mural had appeared in exactly the same spot as the Banksy artwork. Local councillor Alan Strickland said residents had been left ""really shocked and really astonished"" at the disappearance of the mural of the boy. ""Banksy gave that piece of art to our community, and people came from all over London to see it,"" he said. Banksy's work has been at the centre of a number of thefts over the years. In May 2010, two pieces were stolen from a gallery in London, after a man used a road sign to smash a glass window at the front of the building. A year later, a piece known as Sperm Alarm was ripped off the wall of a hotel in Central London, and appeared on eBay for £17,000. It was never recovered.",从伦敦街头被移走的一幅涂鸦艺术家班克西的作品，将不再参加即将在美国举行的拍卖。,涂鸦艺术家班克西的这幅作品一直是当地居民的骄傲。 这幅描绘这名男孩猫着腰在缝纫英国国旗样式小旗的涂鸦壁画，本月早些时候从北伦敦维马克大街(Whymark Avenue)的墙上消失。 随后，这幅作品出现在了美国迈阿密即将举办的拍卖中。目前，该拍卖行已和BBC明确表示，这幅作品将不再参与此次拍卖，但并未说明其中原因。 但同时，就在班克西的这幅涂鸦作品被移走后，现在这面墙上又出现了一幅新作品。 这幅叫做被奴役的童工(Slave Labour)的作品，是在去年五月份英国女王登基六十周年庆典结束后不久，出现在这条位于北伦敦的大街墙上的。 要是这幅被移走的涂鸦壁画参与拍卖的话，有可能卖出45万英镑的价格。 钟爱和失望 一直为阻挠从自己家门口的大街墙上被挪到美国迈阿密被拍卖的伦敦哈灵格区政府(Haringey Council)对这一决定表示欢迎。 该区政府负责人库伯(Claire Kober)表示，能成功阻止这幅壁画被拍卖，是全体社区的骄傲。 她说：我门将进一步努力，想尽办法将这幅班克西的作品重新迎回它本来属于的社区。 同时，在这幅涂鸦壁画消失的那面墙上出现的新作品，也不知是否也来自神秘的涂鸦艺术家班克西。这幅新作画的是一名修女。 在被奴役的童工被移走后，生活在当地的很多居民都感到很失望。 当地区政府官员斯特里克兰德表示，当这幅作品消失后，当地居民感到震惊和失望。 他说：这是班克西送给我们这个社区的一份艺术，来自伦敦各个地方的人都会到这里看这幅作品。 而涂鸦艺术家班克西的作品，在最近几年也成为盗贼的头号目标。 与内文相关的链接 相关话题
"If confirmed by the US Senate, Ms Yellen, 67, would replace Ben Bernanke, who has held the post for eight years. She has been his deputy for the last two years, and would become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve. Ms Yellen and Mr Bernanke are due to appear with the president on Wednesday. She has taught at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, as well as holding a series of senior administrative positions in the US. 'Depth of experience' Ms Yellen, like Mr Bernanke, is seen as a ""dove"", meaning she prefers to prioritise boosting employment by keeping rates low rather than worrying about inflation. Her nomination has been widely expected since former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew his candidature last month amid opposition from liberal Democrats. As Democrats control the 100-seat Senate, Ms Yellen's appointment would only need six Republican votes to overcome potential any procedural hurdles. Some conservatives are scrutinising her views on monetary policy and her support for previous federal stimulus efforts. On Wednesday, the second-most powerful Republican in the Senate questioned whether she was the right choice. ""Ms Yellen subscribes to the liberal school of thought that the best way to handle our nation's fiscal challenges is to throw more money at them,"" John Cornyn of Texas, the party's whip in the Senate, said in a statement. ""This stimulus obsession is the reason the nation finds itself in the fiscal calamity it does today, and the last thing we need is a leader at the helm of the Federal Reserve who is intent on more quantitative easing that harms our economy."" Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican on the banking committee, said in a statement: ""I voted against Vice-Chairman Yellen's original nomination to the Fed in 2010 because of her dovish views on monetary policy."" ""We will closely examine her record since that time, but I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed."" 'Battle tested' But Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said Ms Yellen would win Senate confirmation ""by a wide margin"". The chairman of the US Senate banking committee, Tim Johnson, said she had ""a depth of experience that is second to none"". ""I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman,"" he added. The BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, says the transition from Mr Bernanke to Ms Yellen is likely to be ""seamless"" and will not have much impact, because the two already work so closely together. ""I don't think there's going to be a radical change,"" she said on Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the changeover was unlikely to alter the timing of the Fed's withdrawal of economic stimulus. Ms Yellen's most recent academic post was at the University of California, Berkeley. A former colleague there, Laura Tyson, professor of business and economics, told the BBC Ms Yellen's nomination was ""terrific news"". ""We have an outstanding candidate who is a wonderful match of skills and experience and temperament and reputation around the world at a time when monetary policy is extremely important,"" she said. ""Continuity is important and Janet is an outstanding candidate."" A former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, Prof Randy Kroszner, told the BBC that Ms Yellen was ""battle tested"" and would be driven by the data in deciding when to reduce support to the markets.",白宫官员说，奥巴马总统将提名联邦储备局副主席詹妮特·耶伦担任下届央行总裁。,如获参院通过，詹妮特·耶伦将成为美联储的首任女性总裁。 如果提名得到参院批准，耶伦将接替已经担任总裁八年之久的伯南克主掌联邦储备局工作。 这意味着，已经担任伯南克副手两年的耶伦将成为联邦储备局的首任女性总裁。 预计，耶伦将于周三（10月9日）同伯南克和奥巴马一同会见媒体。 “不二人选” 现年67岁的耶伦曾在哈佛大学和伦敦经济学院任教，并曾在美国担任过一系列高管职务。 同伯南克一样，耶伦被视为“鸽派”人物。这表明，同担心通胀相比，她更为重视以控制低利率的方式扩大就业。 民主党资深参议员舒马尔说，耶伦得到政界的广泛支持，其提名将以压倒性优势获参院通过。 参院银行业务委员会主席约翰森说，耶伦“拥有无与伦比的资历与经验”。 他表示，耶伦毫无疑问将成为一名出色的联邦储备局总裁。
"By Esther WebberBBC News It's been billed as the most important piece of televised political theatre in Scotland's history. For two hours between 20:00 BST and 22:00 BST, the figureheads of the ""Yes"" and ""No"" campaigns will participate in a head-to-head showdown in a bid to win over hearts and minds before the referendum on 18 September, when voters will be asked the yes/no question: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"" There's already been drama over the line-up. Mr Salmond repeatedly called for UK Prime Minister David Cameron to face him in the debate, calling him ""feart"" when he rejected the invitation. Mr Cameron said as leader of the pro-UK campaign, Mr Darling was the man for the job. Then there was a wrangling over the date. Now there's the much-anticipated spectacle of a live debate. A silver-tongued swipe at the opposition can gain admiration. An ill-timed stumble or an embarrassing gaffe can send a campaign into an tailspin. Both protagonists have experience in the field. The leader of the SNP faced other Scottish party leaders in a debate before the Holyrood elections in 2011 and Mr Darling has been a familiar face on the small screen as a former Scotland Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer. But how much do televised debates matter? Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes - which organised the responsive ""worm"" that tracked audience reactions to the leaders' debates before the general election in 2010 - says the one thing TV debates guarantee is a wider audience - ""viewers who wouldn't normally watch political programmes"". ""It can be a particular help where things are unknown - that's what we saw with Nick Clegg [ahead of the 2010 British general election]. He had a much lower profile back then, and that exposure created the 'I agree with Nick' phenomenon and so-called Clegg-mania,"" he says. Following that logic, Mr Mludzinski argues that ""there is more to gain for Darling, who's perhaps less well-known as an orator and has the chance to make a good impression"". However, Scott Macnab, a political correspondent for the Scotsman, says the SNP leader will also be hoping to gain some ground. ""The polls are against Alex Salmond. He's the one who really has to make it happen. If Mr Darling and Mr Salmond came out level-pegging, I suspect the Better Together people would be pretty happy with that. For Alistair Darling, it's a case of damage limitation,"" he says. There is also more of a risk of Mr Salmond's personality eclipsing the campaign on the ""Yes"" side, he argues, since the first minister is ""a love-hate figure"". ""He will have to show that independence will be better for the people of Scotland - in terms of the economy, healthcare et cetera - in order to avoid it being a referendum on Alex Salmond,"" he says. But if either man turns out to be a smash hit with viewers, would it make people more likely to vote for their cause? And would a gaffe have the opposite impact? Mr Clegg's rating jumped from just under 20% to fluctuating between 28% and 33% after the three televised leader debates before the British general election, but his TV appearance didn't translate into as many votes as he might have hoped - the Lib Dems went from 62 seats to 57. But the public response to his performance was ""useful all the same"", Mr Mludzinski says, ""since it helped give him the credibility he needed going into the negotiations that led to the coalition being formed"". Some televised debates across the Atlantic in the US - where they are more widespread - have had more impact. Texas governor Rick Perry was a much-fancied contender in the 2011 race for the Republican nomination before he decided to list the three government departments he would axe if he made it to the White House in a TV debate. The trouble was, he could only remember two of them. He withdrew from the race shortly afterwards. And in the first US presidential TV debate in 1960, Republican nominee Richard Nixon famously lost out on the presidency after many thought he appeared sweaty and shifty next to a polished and confident John F Kennedy. However, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, says in general, TV debates in the US ""don't have a great deal of impact on the way people vote"". ""Where it does make a difference is for the minority of voters who've not made up their minds or who don't have strong partisan ties - and also where the race is very close,"" she says. In the case of the referendum, Mr Macnab thinks it will be difficult for either side to produce a trump card to woo the undecided since ""everything's already out there"" - something that those that feel there are still many unanswered questions would challenge. But if debates only make a difference in a small number of cases, why do broadcasters and politicians hold them? In addition to trying to reach and inform more voters, they also help make politicians more accessible and give an insight into how they might deal with different policies, Prof Jamieson argues. ""While they might not make people switch sides, we know debates help people learn how candidates would govern and how they would handle certain issues - they're very useful in tying campaigns to governance,"" he says. So would Scots like to see their politicians on TV more often? Mr Macnab is sceptical. ""It's been a very long campaign and most people are getting a little weary of it. Watching the Commonwealth Games has been a welcome break,"" he says. The debate's viewing figures might be the best indicator of how many people are engaged - or have already switched off. The debate will be shown on STV on Tuesday 5 August at 20:00 BST.",苏格兰地方政府首席部长、苏格兰国家党领袖萨蒙德与反对苏格兰独立的英国跨党派团体“统一好”（Better Together）主席达林就苏格兰独立问题举行电视辩论。,萨蒙德（左）和达林（右）分别代表支持苏格兰独立的阵营和反对的阵营 萨蒙德说，苏格兰是由苏格兰并没有投票选出的英国议会来管制。 达林说，主张苏格兰独立的活动人士并没有就一些关键问题提供答案。 萨蒙德和达林的辩论周二（8月5日）晚上8点开始，在苏格兰最大城市格拉斯哥举行。整个辩论持续两个小时。 除现场大约350名听众之外，英国和全世界的观众通过电视和互联网看到现场直播的辩论实况。 有关苏格兰是否应该独立的全民公决将在9月18日举行，苏格兰选民届时将就“苏格兰是否应该成为独立国家？”这一简单问题做出“是”或“否”的回答。 萨蒙德所领导的苏格兰国家党坚决主张苏格兰独立，而前工党财政大臣达林领导的“统一好”团体代表了英国反对苏格兰独立的政治力量，受到英国三大政党保守党、工党和自由民主党的共同支持。 萨蒙德在辩论中指出，很少有人质疑苏格兰可以成为一个成功的、独立的国家。 他说，参加英联邦运动会的71个国家中，有49个国家的面积与苏格兰相同，或者还要小一些。但是苏格兰数以千计的儿童以及他们的家人需要依赖慈善食品库，而英国政府却要花钱维护核武器，其资金数量“令人发指”。 萨蒙德说，“在我一生中的一半时间里，苏格兰一直被不是我们选出的政党所统治，这些政党给我们带来的是人头税和卧室税。同样是这些人通过“恐吓项目”告诉我们苏格兰不能管理自己的事务。” “今天晚上我要说明的很简单，没有任何人比在苏格兰生活工作的人更能管好苏格兰。” “9月18日那一天，我们将获得一生难得的机会，我们应该用双手抓住这一机会。” 达林反击 达林说，独立公投事关苏格兰的未来，这与爱国主义无关。 他指出，“有的时候，为了爱我们的家庭，爱我们的国家，我们最好说‘不”——这不是因为我们不能说，而是因为这不是最佳选择。” “再过6个星期，我们将在苏格兰作出迄今最重大的决定，不过一定要记住，我们一旦决定离开，我们将无法挽回，也不会有第二次机会。” 英国前财政大臣达林在反击萨蒙德时指出，“我们不能根据猜测，祈求好运或者盲目相信来作决定。” “针对独立带来风险，我们要满怀信心表示，我们要自豪地表示，我们要乐观地说，‘不，谢谢’。我们要表示‘我们希望得到两全其美，这不仅是为了我们，也是为了子孙后代。” 卡梅伦拒绝 苏格兰国家党此前曾要求在萨蒙德和英国首相卡梅伦之间就这一话题举行电视辩论，但是遭到唐宁街的拒绝。首相府表示，达林能够代表反对苏格兰独立的阵营。 主张苏格兰独立的阵营表示，他们“期待着”这次辩论。 推动独立行动负责人詹金斯说，“公众将有机会了解到：为什么有关苏格兰未来的决定要在苏格兰做出。” 他说，他相信大多数仍然没有做出决定的选民会在听完辩论之后就独立投下赞成票。 “统一好”行动负责人麦克道格拉斯呼吁苏格兰国家党领袖萨蒙德在辩论中就英镑、养老金和公共服务问题提供“直截了当的答案”。 （编译/责编：路西）
"The authorities are now able to blacklist and force offline certain websites without a trial. The law was approved by both houses of parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July. Human rights groups have said the legislation might increase censorship in the country. The law is the amendment to the current Act for Information. The authorities say the goal is to protect minors from websites featuring sexual abuse of children, offering details about how to commit suicide, encouraging users to take drugs and sites that solicit children for pornography. If the websites themselves cannot be shut down, internet service providers (ISPs) and web hosting companies can be forced to block access to the offending material. The list of banned website will be managed by Roskomnadzor (Russia's Federal Service for Supervision in Telecommunications, Information Technology and Mass Communications). It is meant to be updated daily, but its contents are not available to the general public. Critics have described it another attempt by President Vladimir Putin to exercise control over the population. ""Of course there are websites that should not be accessible to children, but I don't think it will be limited to that,"" Yuri Vdovin, vice-president of Citizens' Watch, a human rights organisation based in Saint-Petersburg, told the BBC. ""The government will start closing other sites - any democracy-oriented sites are at risk of being taken offline. ""It will be [an attack on] the freedom of speech on the internet."" Mr Vdovin said that to close a website, the government would simply have to say that its content was ""harmful to children"". ""But there are lots of harmful websites out there already, for example, fascist sites - and they could have easily been closed down by now - but no, [the government] doesn't care, there are no attempts to do so,"" he added. A risk for websites? Besides NGOs and human rights campaigners, websites including the Russian search engine giant Yandex, social media portal Mail.ru and the Russian-language version of Wikipedia have all protested against the law. The latter, for instance, took its content offline for a day ahead of the vote in July, claiming the law ""could lead to the creation of extra-judicial censorship of the entire internet in Russia, including banning access to Wikipedia in the Russian language"". Yandex temporarily crossed out the word ""everything"" in its ""everything will be found"" logo. ""The way the new law will work depends on the enforcement practice,"" said a spokesman. ""Yandex, along with other key Russian market players, is ready to discuss with lawmakers the way it is going to work."" In July, the Russian social networking site Vkontakte posted messages on users' homepages warning that the law posed a risk to its future. However, the country's telecom minister Nikolai Nikiforov, suggested that such concerns were overblown when he spoke at the NeForum blogging conference this week. ""Internet has always been a free territory,"" he said, according to a report by Russian news agency Tass. ""The government is not aimed at enforcing censorship there. LiveJournal, YouTube and Facebook showcase socially responsible companies. ""That means that they will be blocked only if they refuse to follow Russian laws, which is unlikely, in my opinion."" There is also evidence suggesting public support for the move. A survey conducted by pollster Levada Centre in late July indicated that about 62% of those asked supported the idea of a blacklist, with only 16% opposing it.",俄罗斯一项旨在保护儿童不受互联网有害内容影响的法律开始生效，允许政府在未经法庭裁决的情况下强行关闭一些网站。,这项法律是对现行的信息管理法的修正，已经得到俄罗斯议会上下两院通过，并由俄罗斯总统普京在今年7月份签署批准。 但是人权活动人士说，新的立法可能导致俄罗斯更严格的信息审查。 当局指出，一些网站宣扬性侵儿童，提供如何自杀的细节，鼓励吸毒，并且收集儿童色情照片，而立法的目的是为了保护儿童。 受到批评 根据新的法律，如果这样的网站拒绝自行关闭，当局可以强迫互联网服务商关闭这些网站。 批评人士说，这是俄罗斯总统普京企图控制俄罗斯人民的最新举动。 这些人士指出，当然需要保护儿童不受互联网有害内容的影响，但是政府的行动将不限于此，将会开始关闭一些倡导民主的网站。 俄罗斯通讯部长尼基伏罗夫对此表示，互联网永远是一个自由的领域，政府不会在这个领域推行审查制度，只有在网站拒绝执行俄罗斯法律的时候才会遭到封锁。 与内文相关的链接 相关新闻话题
"By Sam CabralBBC News, Washington We've been hearing from lawmakers - but what do Americans think? We asked members of our BBC voter panel to weigh in. Belinda is an attorney and devoted Trump supporter of Native American and African American ancestry. She says this second impeachment vote is wrong and misconstrues the facts of what happened last week in favour of political expediency. This is unprecedented. There is no justification, no legal or constitutional basis for this impeachment. He did not even receive due process. It's a rush to judgment for ulterior motives and a dark stain on our country. I'm afraid our Constitution is on its deathbed. I hope the American people will stand up against this outrage. It's indicative of what would happen in a communist country where we have no free speech rights. Those who broke in should be charged appropriately for whatever laws they violated. But why would anybody who's rational think that our president meant for people to go break into the Capitol? His rallies have always been peaceful and most of the people on Wednesday were middle-aged and elderly, with children and grandchildren. Individuals who violated the law should definitely be prosecuted but I don't see how you can blame someone for a speech and someone else's criminal activity. It can't be selective enforcement of the law. Melissa is a Filipino American small business owner with two children who had told us the country could not afford four more years of Donald Trump. She says the behaviour he displayed last Wednesday was undoubtedly an impeachable offense. Everything he has done is unconstitutional and, as a president, the number one thing he should be doing is upholding the Constitution. [Republican Congresswoman] Liz Cheney said that, if not for the president, last week would not have happened and she's right. If not for him continually fighting the election results, if not for him repeatedly sending the false message the election was stolen, if not for him holding that rally near the Capitol, if not for him talking about an 'uprising', last week would very likely not have happened. Even three months ago, before all the lawsuits and everything else he was saying, I was not shocked by his behaviour. It's all completely predictable because it's just within his character. So the argument by politicians that impeachment could divide us more, I don't see that as the goal of impeachment. It can't help but I don't think it will have any impact on deterring violence. There needs to be some kind of statement that the president is not allowed to attack another branch of government. It's a chance for the Republican Party to rid itself of Trump's stranglehold on them. Gabriel is a regional coordinator for the New York Young Republicans and is an outspoken 'Latino for Trump'. He condemns the violence of last Wednesday but says the reaction has been unfair and worries about where the party will go from here. I do not think that Donald Trump should be impeached. I was in DC at the rally on 6 January - I did not go near the Capitol and went back to my hotel room - but I saw the president speak with my own eyes and he did not call for anyone to storm the building or cause harm. This is just a way to ensure he will not run in the next four years. It is political and it will create a bigger divide between left and right. I fear that people will become reactionary and elected officials will use impeachment in the future not as a last resort to uphold our republic but as a tool to remove whoever they don't agree with. All violence should be condemned fairly and justly. It was a very sad outcome, but I do not believe it was the most horrible day in our country's history and it was not a coup. It's important to dictate that violence is not the answer. The day was supposed to be different. January 6 did something to the Republican Party. The actions of the few will discourage many of the new voters that Trump brought in and made his base. Williams is a first-generation Mexican American college student in Atlanta who has been extremely concerned about what he has seen in his country over the past four years. He says the events of the past week justify today's vote in the House. I believe he should have been impeached. Not only is he a threat to our national security, but he doesn't condemn white supremacy and other threats. That affects us internally within the United States as well as abroad. It's more of a symbolic impeachment at this point because he'll be out soon, but it's necessary nonetheless. Impeachment failed once, but now he has set the precedent that a president can be impeached more than once. In processing the past week, all I could do at first was to ignore it and joke about the situation. It's deeply saddening to me.",美国前总统特朗普（Donald Trump；台译：川普）被控煽动叛乱，遭众议院弹劾，但参议院美东时间周六表决时，结果未达定罪所需的三分之二多数门槛，弹劾案落幕。,赞成及反对弹劾特朗普分别为57票：43票。有7名共和党人投票赞成特朗普有罪，但弹劾特朗普所需票数需要达到67票。 特朗普对参院的否决投票发表声明，并谴责该审理是历史上最大的猎巫行动。 特朗普对参议院的否决投票发表声明，谴责其是“历史上最大的猎巫行动。” 他又称，将致力让“美国再次伟大”的政治行动“才刚开始”。 这是特朗普面对的第二次弹劾案。 如果他被定罪，参议院可以投票禁止他再次竞选公职。 投票结果公布后，共和党资深参议员麦康奈尔（Mitch McConnell）表示，特朗普对国会山庄暴动“负有责任”，并将其称为“可耻的失职。” 但他对此次弹劾条款投下反对票，他认为因为特朗普不再是总统，此刻弹劾他是违宪。而特朗普的审判推迟到1月20日特朗普卸任后，麦康奈尔被认为是关键的运作者。 但是，麦康奈尔警告说，特朗普仍可能在法庭上承担责任。 他说：“他还没能脱身。我们国家拥有刑事司法系统，我们还有民事诉讼，每一位前任总统，对于被追究法律责任都无法免疫。” 特朗普二次弹劾的定罪机会有多大？ 众议院议长佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）则抨击对此案投下否决票的共和党籍参议员“懦弱”。 众议院议长佩洛西（Nancy Pelosi）则抨击对此案投下无罪票的共和党籍参议员“懦弱”。 被任命主持参议院弹劾案，众院控方小组成员之一，民主党众议员内古斯（Joe Neguse）警告说，特朗普的处境十分危险。 他说：“此次审判太重要了，因为摆在眼前的残忍事实是，1月6日发生的事情可能会再次发生。” 另一控方小组成员，民主党众议员迪恩（Madeleine Dean ）说：“历史时刻就在眼前，我请求你们不要反其道而行。” 但是，特朗普先生的律师范德文（Michael van der Veen）将诉讼称为“审判秀”，并表示民主党人“痴迷”弹劾特朗普。 他说：“这次弹劾从头到尾充满虚伪”; “ 整个审理，不过是反对党对特朗普的长期政治仇恨的无情行动。” 特朗普本人则表示，没有任何美国总统“历经过类似的事情”，“让美国再次伟大的运动”才刚刚开始。 参议院為何最终没有传讯证人？ 参院最初投票赞成传唤证人作证，而这将推迟在周六的投票。但是在进行紧急磋商以之后，参院改变了决定，仅接受书面陈述。 在他们了解究竟特朗普与共和党最高官员凯文·麦卡锡（Kevin McCarthy）在国会山庄暴动当天的电话中，到底说了什么之后，便表示将不主动传唤证人。 众议院共和党议员赫雷拉．巴特勒（Jaime Herrera Beutler）说，麦卡锡已将当天与前总统电话内容告诉了她。 她说，麦卡锡当时曾恳求特朗普平息暴动，但总统错误地指责了左翼激进分子 Antifa( 安提法运动）才是造成暴动的人士。 巴特勒说：“麦卡锡在电话中反驳并告诉总统，那些都是你的支持者”;“据麦卡锡说，那时候总统说：好吧，凯文，我想这些人比你对选举结果更感到沮丧。” 最后，巴特勒众议员的陈述仅以书面形式给了参议院。 特朗普任期的功过：撼动美国政坛与国际形势的总统 分析：弹劾结果对特朗普意味这么？ 安东尼·泽克尔（Anthony Zurcher） BBC驻北美记者 新的弹劾审理，同样的结果。 特朗普再次从被美国参议院的定罪中全身而退。因为他的共和党人同事基本上都站在他那边。最终的投票结果是57-43，还差10票才能到达到能判他有罪的2/3票数。 从最基本的角度来看，这是这位前总统的一次胜利。 如果他有意愿，特朗普仍然有资格在2024年再次竞选总统。 所有迹象表明，支持他的阵营基本上仍然完好。无论是在众议院还是在参议院，大多数共和党公职人员都下反对弹劾票。而那些支持弹劾的共和党，已经面临着猛烈的抨击，而且一些人还是遭到共和党同志的正式谴责。 这位前总统在新闻稿上庆祝了他的无罪并谴责民主党，同时表示他的政治运动才刚刚开始。 但是，从这次弹劾案中，特朗普及其政治运动并未毫发无损。 在众议院关于弹劾案的审理中，最令人难忘的部分之一是呈现了暴动当天的影相片段，记录着特朗普支持者戴上有“让美国再次伟大”字样的帽子，挥舞着特朗普的旗帜，在国会山庄大肆破坏。 这些影像将永远与“特朗普”这个品牌连在一起。 从此以后，每一次他举行的集会或动，将会唤起人们对这场骚动的记忆。 这可能不会让他共和党支持者中失去声誉，但是无政党立场的独立选民或温和派人士不大可能会忘记。投票当日发生了什么事？
"The paper's Tehran correspondent, Jason Rezaian, is accused of ""collaborating with hostile governments"" and spreading ""propaganda"", his lawyer said. Mr Rezaian was arrested in July and charged in December but the accusations against him were not known until now. The Washington Post has called the charges ""absurd and despicable"". A statement from the paper's executive editor, Martin Baron, accused Iran of ""indefensible silence"" in having kept Mr Rezaian in jail for nine months without revealing why. It urged Iran to clear the names of its correspondent and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who is also a journalist and was also taken into custody in July. ""The world will be watching; any just outcome to this tragic charade can result only in Jason and Yegi's exoneration and immediate release,"" the statement said. The US State Department said the charges against Mr Rezaian, if confirmed, were ""patently absurd"", Reuters news agency reports. The US is one of a team of world powers negotiating with Iran over its disputed nuclear programme. It has repeatedly pressed Iran to release Mr Rezaian and other detained US citizens. 'No access' Mr Rezaian's lawyer, Leila Ahsan, learnt of the charges after meeting him for the first time on Monday, the Washington Post says. The charges against him are said to include gathering information about ""internal and foreign policy"" and providing it to ""individuals with hostile intent"". Ms Ahsan said she had not seen any evidence against her client. She defended him, saying that as a journalist, ""it is in the nature of his profession to gain access to information and publish it"". ""My client, however, has never had any direct or indirect access to classified information to share with anyone.""

"By Andrew BlackPolitical reporter, BBC Scotland He revealed the date as draft legislation on holding the vote was brought before the Scottish Parliament. Voters will be asked the yes/no question, ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"" The Scottish government said it was a historic day, but opposition parties accused the SNP of keeping voters in the dark for too long. Scots ministers previously only said the referendum would take place in autumn 2014. Announcing the date while speaking in the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, Mr Salmond said: ""It's worth reflecting, just for a moment, on the privilege this nation and this generation will have - nothing less than choosing the future course of our country. ""We have been on a journey since 1999, since the restoration of our parliament here in the heart of our ancient capital. We've witnessed a growing confidence, an increase in democratic accountability. ""I'm honoured to announce that, on Thursday the 18th of September 2014, we will hold Scotland's referendum - a historic day when the people will decide Scotland's future."" Scottish ministers - who will publish their substantive case for independence in a white paper later this year - said a ""Yes"" vote would allow Scotland to use its natural assets to build a better country. Scots opposition parties who support the Union - Labour, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, as well as the Westminster government - said Scotland was better off as part of the wider UK. Mr Salmond said: ""People will be able to choose if they want a Scotland that is independent and able to make her own decisions - with a Scottish Parliament that is responsible for making the most of Scotland's rich resources to benefit its communities and safeguard the welfare of our most vulnerable citizens and accountable for how we engage other nations around the world."" MSPs will need to approve the arrangements for the vote in the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill, although the SNP's parliamentary majority means the passage of the legislation is assured. The Scottish government said the bill would make sure that: Reacting to the date Johann Lamont, leader of Scottish Labour, said: ""The truth is, Alex Salmond knows if he held the referendum now, he wouldn't just lose it, he would be routed. ""All the self-aggrandizement of today isn't just a sign of the first minister's usual pomposity. ""Making an occasion out of a delayed announcement is an attempt to con the people into believing that we have moved a step towards independence when we haven't."" Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson welcomed the clarity provided by the date, adding: ""I believe that, in September of next year, the people of Scotland will vote to stay within our United Kingdom. ""Recognising that the autonomy the Scottish Parliament has in areas such as health, social care education and justice, allied with the strength of being part of a larger UK family, the safety and security of our intelligence services, the international standing from our diplomatic corps and the advantages of being one of the largest economies in the planet means Scotland can make a positive choice for devolution - the very best of both worlds - not opt for separation."" Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, told MSPs: ""I'm sure the first minister is excited by today's events, but after all the build up, this looks like one of those occasions where the trailer's more exciting than the movie. ""It's taken the first minister almost 700 days to get the Cabinet to agree to the date of the referendum - why on earth does he think it will take him less time to break up the country?"" Green MSP Patrick Harvie, whose party supports independence, said: ""Now we have the date for our diaries, the effort to persuade those who are undecided must focus on the needs of real people and not just those with loud voices and deep pockets."" Independent member Margo MacDonald, who also backs a ""Yes"" vote in 2014, said the level of debate must now be raised, telling the parliament: ""This is about a country's soul - it's about your children and your grandchildren's standards and place in the world."" For the UK government, Scottish secretary Michael Moore welcomed news of the date, adding: ""The debate about Scotland's future has already begun and will only intensify, and that is something I look forward to. ""I am confident when Scots go to the polls they will vote in favour of Scotland staying within a strong and secure UK family."" A special Scottish Parliament cross-party committee is to begin scrutinising the referendum legislation, and has asked interested individuals and organisations to submit their views. The Scottish government has already introduced separate draft legislation to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in the ballot.",苏格兰地方政府首席部长、苏格兰民族党领袖亚历克斯·萨蒙德（Alex Salmond）周四（21日）宣布，苏格兰将在2014年9月18日就独立举行全民公投。,苏格兰16岁以上的民众将有资格参加独立公投 选民们将就苏格兰是否应该成为一个独立国家投票表决。 苏格兰公投日期宣布之前，反对独立的苏格兰工党领袖约翰·拉蒙特（Johann Lamont）批评主张独立的苏格兰执政民族党（Scotish National Party）一心着迷于争取独立，却罔顾备受压力的普通家庭。 提交给苏格兰议会的公投法案将需要苏格兰议员的批准，不过，由于苏格兰民族党占了议会的绝大多数议席，所以确保了公投法案肯定将获得通过。 苏格兰政府已经提交了另一项法律草案，允许16-17岁的青年能够参加公投投票。 今年晚些时候，苏格兰各部部长们将就独立实际影响公布白皮书，称如果公投批准独立将允许苏格兰利用自身的自然财富建立一个更好的国家。 不过反对独立的各界人士认为，苏格兰留在大不列颠及北爱尔兰王国内将更加受益。 英国首相卡梅伦（David Cameron）与萨蒙德在2012年10月15日就苏格兰独立公投的计划签署协议。 该协议同意投票将在2014年进行，以简单的是/否来对苏格兰独立进行投票。 英国政府会根据第30条规定给苏格兰议会一定限度的权力举行合法的公投。 与内文相关的链接 相关话题
"The koala, dubbed Lewis, had been taken to an animal hospital last week after a woman plucked him from a tree in burning bushland in New South Wales. Video of the rescue - which shows Toni Doherty using her shirt to wrap up the koala - was viewed globally. Vets said the marsupial was put down because his burns were not improving. ""[Our] number one goal is animal welfare, so it was on those grounds that this decision was made,"" said Port Macquarie Koala Hospital. Six people have died and more than 500 homes have been lost since a bushfire crisis began ravaging Australia in September. 'It was just so heart-rending' In the video, Ms Doherty is seen pouring water over the distressed animal in an attempt to cool it. She told local news outlets she had been driving through the forest when she spotted the koala among the flames and heard its cries. ""I didn't realise they could cry out. It was just so heart-rending and I knew I needed to get him out of there as quickly as possible,"" Ms Doherty told Nine News. The 14-year-old koala had significant burns to its chest, feet and other parts of its body, vets said. The hospital has treated dozens of koalas injured from the bushfires which have burnt through more than a million hectares in New South Wales alone.

"Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter Six months after agreeing it could have a limited role, ministers look set to exclude the Chinese company, with no new equipment installed from next year. The move is in part a result of pressure from Washington. However, the precise time frame and details of the phase-out will be crucial in determining how the decision is received. In January, after a lengthy delays and hard-fought battles, the government announced that Huawei would be kept out of the sensitive core of the 5G network and limited to 35% market share of its other parts. But now it finds itself revisiting that decision. A key reason is the Trump administration has continued what one UK official calls a campaign of ""unrelenting pressure"" on the company. US officials have claimed China could use the firm as a gateway to ""spy, steal or attack"" the UK - Huawei denies this and its founder has said he would rather shut the company down than do anything to damage its clients. New sanctions in May limited Huawei's access to US chip technology. That forced the UK's National Cyber Security Centre to launch a review to understand whether using alternative chips would reduce the level of assurance it could offer about Huawei's presence in the UK. But the decision will be as much about geopolitics and domestic politics as it is about technicalities. Attitudes to China have hardened in the last six months. The Coronavirus crisis - and Beijing's handling of it - have increased concerns about dependencies on China. And the growing tension over Hong Kong has heightened concerns about whether China is becoming more authoritarian. A significant Conservative backbench rebellion in March suggested there were already many wanting a tougher policy, and their confidence and numbers have been fuelled by events in the intervening months. But amid heavy lobbying from telecoms companies, which have warned of mobile coverage blackouts if they are forced to remove Huawei equipment fast, the government has been debating how quickly to move. A long lead time for Huawei kit to be removed of seven to 10 years would leave critics unhappy but cause less disruption. Three to five years would placate them, but impose many more costs because of the need to rip out existing Huawei equipment, which is sometimes integrated with 4G and older equipment. If the telecom networks fall behind with their 5G rollout as a result, it would make it harder for the government to deliver on its promises of increasing connectivity for the country in the coming years. China may also seek some way of punishing the UK, partly to discourage others from following its course. But equally, if the new policy is seen as not tough enough, then critics on the backbenches may continue their rebellion to push for a tighter time-frame when legislation is brought to parliament in the autumn. Whatever the case, a decision which has already been overturned once may still be fought over in the months ahead.",英国政府很有可能会改变初衷，收紧华为5G在英国的使用。近期媒体的多番报道透露政策走向。,美国积极游说英国政府改变今年1月的决定，不使用中国华为5G技术。 华为5G技术和香港《国安法》是近期英国舆论最为关注的中国话题。 6月1日（周一）《泰晤士报》报道称，首相鲍里斯·约翰逊正在考虑各种选项，提升对本国电讯企业的投资帮助它们增强在5G市场的竞争力。 该报称，这一提案是英国更宏大计划的一部分，在外界对中国公司设备的安全担忧越来越大之际，要减少英国对华为5G技术的依赖。 《泰晤士报》报道称：由白宫牵头，美国方面对英国展开积极的游说活动，劝说英国重新考虑使用华为5G技术的决定。 《金融时报》周一也报道称，英国正在评估美国制裁华为可能造成的影响。 该报分析认为，英国的重新评估可能为政府改变此前的决定铺路。 英国首相约翰逊在竞选纲领中曾承诺将提升英国的５Ｇ建设，让每个人用上快速的宽带网络。 《金融时报》报道说，英国展开的这一紧急评估，是在上个月美国宣布对华为采取新的出口限制后开始的，将在几周内有结果，而主持评估的是英国情报机关——英国政府通讯总部（GCHQ）属下的国家网络安全中心（National Cyber Security Centre）。 报道认为：“美国的制裁以及英国的评估将给首相鲍里斯·约翰逊提供机会进行180度大转弯，改变自己年初所作的决定”。 今年1月28日约翰逊首相宣布，继续使用华为5G技术，但是附加了一定的条件，其中包括： 美中对立 英国政府的这一决定当时引起了国际间广泛的关注。随后，英国内部出现了更多的声音，要求重新考虑这一决定。美国也加大了对英国的游说。 本周二（6月2日），美国参议院情报委员会成员、共和党参议员汤姆·考顿（Tom Cotton）将在英国议会国防委员会上讲话，主要内容预计将是阐述5G安全问题。 另外，曾经担任美国国家安全委员会战略计划主任的空军准将斯珀丁（Robert Spalding）也将向英国议员阐述他对华为技术的担心。 据《星期天泰晤士报》报道，随着英国媒体不断有消息报道称首相有意改变对华为5G的决定，华为高层将在本周与首相府高级顾问会晤，希望了解英国首相的真实意图。 民主联盟 上周，英国小报《太阳报》报道称，英国政府正在寻求与10个民主国家结盟，为英国提供5G网络，打破中国在5G网络技术的垄断。 报道称，英国政府官员希望组成一个名为“D10”的民主国家俱乐部，资助科技公司开发5G技术，替代华为。 这10个国家将可能包括：加拿大、法国、德国、意大利、日本、英国、美国、澳大利亚、韩国和印度。 华为高管：我们“太有竞争力” 让美国害怕 “付出代价” 《金融时报》周一报道引述专家警告称，如果英国在华为问题上180度转弯，中国共产党将不会袖手旁观不加惩罚，特别是英国在此事的最后决断将受到其他欧洲国家密切关注，影响他们自己使用5G技术的决定。 5月28日，中国官方英文报纸《中国日报》刊登社评称：如果英国将华为排除在外，将要付出代价。 该报认为，把华为设备踢出英国的网络将会“相当程度增加供应商的财政负担、延迟英国的5G网络使用时间、影响与中国的关系、让英国脱欧之后的经济前景暗淡、影响英国长期享有的市场经济声誉。” 5月华为副总裁张国威（Victor Zhang）向BBC表示：“更多的供应商意味着更多竞争、创新和更好的网络可靠性，这对确保消费者能够获得最佳技术至关重要。” 他引用英国网络运营商行业机构去年发表的研究结果称：“排除华为将严重拖延（英国）5G建设，也会使英国经济遭受高达70亿英镑的损失。”
"She wrote on Instagram: ""As many of you know, Kanye has bipolar disorder. ""Anyone who has this or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand."" He is a ""brilliant but complicated person"" whose ""words sometimes do not align with his intentions"", she said. The rapper is one of America's biggest music stars, and is currently attempting to run for US president. But his first campaign rally and a number of recent Twitter messages have sparked confusion and concern. Kim and Kanye married in 2014 and have four children together. In her message on Wednesday, the TV personality and model said she had not previously spoken publicly about how his mental health had affected the family ""because I am very protective of our children and Kanye's right to privacy when it comes to his health"". She wrote: ""But today, I feel like I should comment on it because of the stigma and misconceptions about mental health. ""Those that understand mental illness or even compulsive behaviour know that the family is powerless unless the member is a minor. ""People who are unaware or far removed from this experience can be judgemental and not understand that the individual themselves have to engage in the process of getting help no matter how hard family and friends try."" Kardashian West went on to say her husband was ""subject to criticism because he is a public figure and his actions at times can cause strong opinions and emotions"", but asked for greater empathy and understanding. ""He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bipolar disorder,"" she added. ""Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words sometimes do not align with his intentions. ""Living with bipolar disorder does not diminish or invalidate his dreams and his creative ideas, no matter how big or unobtainable they may feel to some. ""That is part of his genius and as we have all witnessed, many of his big dreams have come true. ""We as a society talk about giving grace to the issue of mental health as a whole, however we should also give it to the individuals who are living with it in times when they need it the most. ""I kindly ask that the media and public give us the compassion and empathy that is needed so that we can get through this."" What is bipolar disorder?

If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.",美国知名说唱歌手坎耶·韦斯特（Kanye West，另译肯伊·威斯特）的妻子金·卡戴珊（Kim Kardashian West）最近通过社交媒体首次公开了丈夫的精神健康问题。,美国名人夫妇韦斯特和卡戴珊有4个孩子，最近卡戴珊说丈夫患有躁郁症。 韦斯特和卡戴珊夫妇是美国的一对名人，在最近一段时间韦斯特曾作出一系列怪异表述，其中包括表示要竞选美国总统等。 这一切促使卡戴珊决定公开谈论丈夫的精神健康问题，并通过Instagram公开了韦斯特患有躁郁症（bipolar disorder）的情况。 卡戴珊写道：“可能你们许多人都知道，坎耶有躁郁症。任何有这个病或是所爱人当中患此病的人都知道这个病情有多复杂和痛苦。” 卡戴珊还表示，自己丈夫是一个复杂的人，有时他的言行未必一致。 卡戴珊表示，以前出于隐私以及保护两人孩子的原因并不想公开丈夫的病情，但她说鉴于人们对精神健康问题的误解和围绕该病的耻辱感，觉得自己应该对此有所表示。 她说，由于韦斯特是公众人物，有时他的一些言行会引起别人强烈的反响，他也会因此受到一些批评。 卡戴珊说，希望能够得到媒体和公众更多的同情和理解，以便他们一家人能够走过这一艰难时刻。 竞选美国总统 现年43岁的韦斯特堪称美国最著名的说唱歌手之一，他曾在本月初（7月4日美国独立日）在推特上表达自己想参选美国总统的愿望。 但其实这已经不是韦斯特第一次声称自己要竞选总统。 早在2015年，韦斯特就在MTV音乐录影带大奖仪式上宣称他要竞选美国总统。 当时，他说他决定参加2020年的美国总统选举。 去年11月，他又说实际上他想角逐2024年的总统选举。但他没有说自己到底是代表哪一个党派参选。 躁郁症 躁郁症也被称为双相情感障碍、情绪两极症以及抑郁狂躁型忧郁症等，它是一种复杂的精神心理疾病。 躁郁症可以分为三种类型， 一型患者会经历躁狂高潮和抑郁低潮期。 二型患者会经历严重的抑郁和轻度狂躁（hypomania）发作，持续时间较短。 第三种是患有周期性发作的人，他们的情绪波动较小，但持续时间更长。 根据英国国民健康系统NHS和英国皇家精神科医学院的资料，在躁狂发作期间，躁郁症病人时而会欣喜若狂，极度开心。这时，他们会精力充沛，制定雄心勃勃的计划。 但他们也会变得狂躁，攻击性极强，并出现精神病症状。 病情严重者还有可能会自杀或自残倾向。 躁郁症的确切原因目前尚不清楚，一些专家认为，它可能跟儿童时期经历过严重的情感困扰有关，也有可能由于遗传和化学因素所导致。 在英国，每100名成年人中就有1人会在生命中某一时段被诊断出患有这种疾病。 患有躁郁症的名人们 威尔士演员泽塔琼斯和自己两个孩子在纽约出席一个支持威尔士演艺界的活动。 2011年，英国威尔士演员，奥斯卡最佳女配角奖得主凯瑟琳·泽塔琼斯（Catherine Zeta Jones）公开承认自己接受过躁郁症治疗。 泽塔琼斯是美国知名演员迈克尔·道格拉斯的妻子，当时她公开病情的这一勇敢行为曾受到媒体赞扬。 另外一些广为人知的名人躁郁症患者包括已故美国演员费雯·丽（Vivien Leigh）。 费雯·丽以主演《乱世佳人》（Gone With the Wind）中郝思嘉（Scarlett O'Hara）一角而著称。 美国歌手玛丽亚·凯莉（Mariah Carey）以及荷兰著名画家梵高（Vincent van Gogh）等许多名人也都饱受不同程度的躁郁症折磨。
"Speaking to reporters on a flight back from Brazil, he reaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church's position that homosexual acts were sinful, but homosexual orientation was not. He was responding to questions about whether there was a ""gay lobby"" in the Vatican. ""If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?"" He also said he wanted a greater role for women in the Church, but insisted they could not be priests. The Pope arrived back in Rome on Monday after a week-long tour of Brazil - his first trip abroad as pontiff - which climaxed with a huge gathering on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach for a world Catholic youth festival. Festival organisers estimated it attracted more than three million people. His remarks on gay people are being seen as much less judgemental than his predecessor's position on the issue. Pope Benedict XVI signed a document in 2005 that said men with deep-rooted homosexual tendencies should not be priests. But Pope Francis said gay clergymen should be forgiven and their sins forgotten. ""The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this very well,"" Pope Francis said in a wide-ranging 80-minute long interview with Vatican journalists. ""It says they should not be marginalised because of this but that they must be integrated into society."" But he condemned what he described as lobbying by gay people. ""The problem is not having this orientation,"" he said. ""We must be brothers. The problem is lobbying by this orientation, or lobbies of greedy people, political lobbies, Masonic lobbies, so many lobbies. This is the worse problem."" On the role of women in the Church, he said: ""We cannot limit the role of women in the Church to altar girls or the president of a charity, there must be more. ""But with regards to the ordination of women, the Church has spoken and says no... That door is closed."" Answering questions about the troubled Vatican bank, he said the institution must become ""honest and transparent"" and that he would listen to advice on whether it could be reformed or should be shut down altogether. ""I don't know what will become of the bank. Some say it is better that is a bank, others that it should be a charitable fund and others say close it,"" he said. 'Undisciplined' Before leaving Brazil, Pope Francis gave a highly unusual one-to-one interview to a Brazilian TV programme. The interview was shown on TV Globo's high-profile Sunday night documentary programme Fantastico, broadcast not long after the Pope departed for Rome. The Pope was asked about the moment on his visit when his driver took a wrong turn and his vehicle was surrounded by crowds. ""I don't feel afraid,"" he answered. ""I know that no-one dies before their time. ""I don't want to see these people who have such a great heart from behind a glass box. The two security teams [from the Vatican and Brazil] worked very well. But I know that I am undisciplined in that respect."" Asked about the recent protests by young people on the streets of Brazil, the Pope said: ""The young person is essentially a non-conformist, and this is very beautiful. ""It is necessary to listen to young people, give them places to express themselves and to be careful that they aren't manipulated."" Asked about his simple lifestyle and use of a small car, he said it wasn't a good example when a priest had the latest model of a car or a top brand. ""At this moment I believe God is asking us for more simplicity,"" he added.",罗马天主教皇方济各表示，不应该排挤同性恋者，而是要将他们纳入社会。,罗马天主教皇方济各对同性恋的态度被视为更加温和 方济各教皇结束了在巴西访问的回程航班上向记者们重申了罗马天主教会的立场，那就是同性恋行为是罪孽的，但他说同性恋倾向却不是。 “如果一个人是同性恋同时一心向神一心向善，那我又怎可以对他们妄加评判？” 他还表示，希望妇女在天主教会中发挥更大的作用，但坚持妇女不可以担任神职。 教皇方济各在巴西进行了为期一周的访问，周一（7月29日）返回罗马。 这是他就任教皇后首次外访。 上周四，他在巴西里约热内卢的科巴卡巴纳海滩，会见了聚集在那里参加世界青年节的百万信众。 教皇是在回答梵蒂冈是否有同性恋游说活动的问题时讲了上述一番话。 这番讲话被视为他比前任诸教皇对同性恋的态度更为温和。 2005年，时任教皇本笃十六世曾经签署文件表示，有很深同性恋倾向的男性不应该成为神职人员。 不过，方济各教皇表示，应该宽恕同性恋神父，忘记他们的罪孽。 （编译：罗玲 责编：董乐）
"Home Secretary Priti Patel said the UK was still at ""a high level of threat"" and an attack could ""occur without further warning"". The terrorism threat is now at its lowest since August 2014. Substantial is the third of five ratings at which the threat level can stand. The separate terrorism threat level for Northern Ireland remains ""severe"". Ms Patel said in a statement on Monday that terrorism remained a ""direct and immediate"" risk to the UK's national security. Assessments determining the country's threat level are taken by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) - part of MI5 - which makes its recommendations independently from the government. ""Government, police and intelligence agencies will continue to work tirelessly to address the threat posed by terrorism in all its forms,"" Ms Patel said. The threat level is kept under ""constant review"", she added. Neil Basu, head of counter terrorism policing, said there had been ""positive developments"" in the fight against terrorism but it was ""vital that we all maintain a high level of vigilance"". He said the UK's counter terrorism policing team had about 800 live counter terrorism investigations - while 24 attack plots had been thwarted since the Westminster attack in March 2017. This is a significant change in the only official public measure of the threat posed by terrorism to the UK - but it's not a sign that there are suddenly fewer people with aspirations to do us harm. The security services are still monitoring thousands of ""subjects of interest"" - the top-tier of would-be plotters from jihadist groups to the far-right. Many of these people are very dangerous because, in the jargon, they are ""lone actors"" bent on DIY violence. But what appears to have changed is the resources and capability available to IS-supporting plotters who need help. Quite simply, a huge number of the foreign fighters who played a key role linking these followers to resources and support died on the battlefields of the militant group's last stand. Continuing propaganda from the survivors, portraying IS as a force to be reckoned with, also has less credibility for would-be recruits. And so it has become harder - for now at least - for some of those with intent to get the help they need to carry out their aspirations. The UK's terrorism threat level was raised to the highest rating, ""critical"", in the days following the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017. It last reached this level again briefly in September that year, after a bomb partially exploded on a Tube train at Parsons Green. The threat level had remained at the second highest rating, ""severe"", until Monday. The Northern Ireland threat level specifically refers to threat to the country from Northern Ireland-related terrorism. It remains at severe - the second-highest level. The five levels of threat set by the JTAC are:",英国内政部把全国面临的国际恐怖袭击威胁级别提高到“严峻”，仅次于最高级别“危急”。,特雷莎·梅在记者会上表示，没有情报显示英国即刻会发生恐怖袭击，提高警戒级别是应对伊拉克和叙利亚局势。 这意味着遭受恐怖袭击的可能性“极高”。 内政大臣特雷莎·梅在记者会上说，没有情报显示“随时”可能发生恐怖袭击。 她说，提高威胁程度的级别，是针对伊拉克和叙利亚局势做出的反应。 英国2011年7月把恐怖袭击威胁级别下调到“显著”。 英国联合反恐分析中心（JTAC）负责确定全国面临遭受恐怖袭击的威胁级别；各行各界的保安部门根据这个级别做出相应的保安部署。 根据内政部资料，恐怖袭击威胁程度分为五级，自上而下分别是危急、严峻、显著、中等、轻微。 （编译：郱书 / 责编：路西）
"By Joe MillerBusiness reporter Data from IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, shows a fall to 47.7 in July, the lowest level since April in 2009. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. Both manufacturing and service sectors saw a decline in output and orders. However, exports picked up, driven by the weakening of the pound. The report surveyed more than 650 services companies, from sectors including transport, business services, computing and restaurants. It asked them: ""Is the level of business activity at your company higher, the same or lower than one month ago?"" It also asked manufacturers whether production had gone up or down. The PMI is the first significant set of data measuring business reaction to the result of the UK referendum. Business Live: Pound tumbles Chancellor may 'reset' economic policy 'Record slump' Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit, said the downturn had been ""most commonly attributed in one way or another to 'Brexit'."" He added that the economy could contract by 0.4% in the third quarter of this year, but that would depend on whether the current slump continued. ""The only other times we have seen this index fall to these low levels, was the global financial crisis in 2008/9, the bursting of the dot com bubble, and the 1998 Asian financial crisis,"" Mr Williamson told the BBC. ""The difference this time is that it is entirely home-grown, which suggest the impact could be greater on the UK economy than before. ""This is exactly what most economists were saying would happen."" A subset of the PMI figures, shows that service companies, such as insurance or advertising, are feeling less positive about the future than at any time since the height of the recession. Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent The figures in PMI surveys are taken seriously by economists as early warning signs of what is in the pipeline. When there is a downturn, the PMIs generally tell the same story. So this is a troubling set of results. But it is just one month's worth. It is possible that this is a ""shock-induced nadir"", as the chief economist at the firm who conducted the survey put it, and that the economy will right itself in the coming months. In addition, the financial markets have stabilised and in some areas rebounded, in an adjustment after the vote that was described by the IMF as severe but generally orderly. That said, the survey results do increase the chances of some action from the Bank of England, perhaps an interest rate cut in August, or perhaps even some additional spending plans in the chancellor's Autumn Statement. 'Heading for recession' Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures provided the ""first major evidence that the UK is entering a sharp downturn"". Although he added that the ""confidence shock from the Leave vote might wear off over the coming months"". Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, said he thought the UK was ""heading for a recession again"", and that the data would almost certainly prompt the Bank of England to roll out further stimulus. The pound has fallen in response to the publication of the data. The UK's new chancellor, Philip Hammond, urged caution. ""Let's be clear, the PMI data is a measure of sentiment, it's not a measure of any hard activity in the economy. ""What it tells us is businesses confidence has been dented, they're not sure, they're in a period of uncertainty now."" Earlier on Friday, Mr Hammond said that he might ""reset"" Britain's fiscal policy. 'No surprise' While IHS Markit's reading on the UK economy was worse than most analysts expected, its verdict on the wider eurozone economy was more cheery. Although business confidence dropped to an 18-month low, the overall pace of economic growth was in line with pre-Brexit trends, and employment across the eurozone rose. The optimistic outlook is in line with comments made by the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, who said on Thursday that Europe's financial markets had ""weathered"" the uncertainty caused by the vote. Europe Economics' Andrew Lilico, who argued during the referendum campaign that leaving the EU would be beneficial for the UK in the long term, told the BBC the PMI data was ""no surprise"", and that it ""doesn't tell us much about what Brexit's longer term impact will be"". Mr Lilico said he always expected a short-term reaction, and those who voted to leave, ""expected a short-term slowdown too"". The downturn, he added, was ""associated with risks in the global economy,"" as well as Brexit.",最新公布的数据显示，英国退出欧盟的决定导致经济活动状况“急剧恶化”，是2008年金融危机以来最糟糕的，也比大部分分析师的预计更差。,脱欧是被用来解释经济活动低迷的最常见理由。 研究机构 IHS Markit 周五（7月22日）公布的数据显示，今年7月英国采购经理指数（PMI）跌到47.7，是2009年4月以来最低点。PMI低于50表示经济收缩。 英镑闻讯下跌。 走向衰退？ 数据显示，制造业和服务业的产出和订单都有所下降，但英镑疲软推高了出口。 该机构的数据基于对交通、商业服务、电脑科技和餐饮业等650多家服务业公司所做调查。这些公司对经营活动转恶最通常的解释是“脱欧”。 PMI指数体现了业界的预期。IHS Markit首席经济师威廉姆森认为，鉴于服务业商业预期如此惨跌，估计短期内情况将不会好转。 有经济学家认为，最新数据是英国正在急转直下的第一个重要证据，有人表示英国经济正再度走向衰退。 也有人指出，脱欧带来的震惊因素在今后几个月里可能会淡化，7月PMI数据并不说明脱欧对英国经济的长期影响，短期的下跌可能不光与脱欧有关，更可能与全球风险有关。 经济学界预期英格兰银行可能会推出新的刺激计划。 财政政策“重设” 财相哈蒙德透露有可能“重设”财政政策。 稍早，新财相哈蒙德表示，他可能会“重设”英国财政政策。 哈蒙德周五表示，还有时间根据近期将陆续公布的数据决定是否在今年晚些时候的秋季预算报告中重设财政政策。 IHS Markit报告显示欧元区经济状况较乐观。 虽然商业信心降到18月最低点，欧元区经济增长保持了英国脱欧公投前的趋势，区内各国就业都有所上升。 欧洲央行日前表示，欧洲各金融市场经受了英国脱欧公投带来的不确定因素冲击，表现良好。
"Michel Barnier said he was ""not in the frame of mind to make concessions or ask for concessions"". UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said talks got off to a ""promising start"". The UK appears to have conceded to the EU's preferred order for the talks which will mean trade negotiations do not begin immediately. Mr Davis and Mr Barnier gave a joint press conference after day one of the talks in Brussels. The initial focus will be on expat rights, a financial settlement and ""other separation issues"". Discussions aimed at preserving the Good Friday Agreement and common travel area in Ireland will also begin, although Mr Davis suggested these issues may not be settled until the end of the process, when the UK's trade relationship with the EU is settled. The UK had wanted talks on its future relationship with the EU to be considered from the outset, but Mr Barnier said this would only happen once the European Council decided ""sufficient progress has been made"" on the other issues. Mr Davis - who had predicted this would be the ""row of the summer"" - denied suggestions the agreed timetable showed Britain's ""weakness"" and insisted it was ""completely consistent"" with the government's aim of parallel trade and exit talks. ""It's not when it starts it's how it finishes that matters,"" he said. Asked whether he had made any concessions to the UK in return, Mr Barnier said the UK had decided to leave the EU - not the other way around, and each side had to ""assume our responsibility and the consequences of our decisions"". ""I am not in a frame of mind to make concessions, or ask for concessions,"" he said. ""It's not about punishment, it is not about revenge. ""Basically, we are implementing the decision taken by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and unravel 43 years of patiently-built relations. ""I will do all I can to put emotion to one side and stick to the facts, the figures, and the legal basis, and work with the United Kingdom to find an agreement in that frame of mind."" Who is in charge? Laura Kuennsberg, BBC political editor It's often compared to a divorce - the UK wanted to talk about who gets the house and the CD collection at the same time as settling who pays for the kids' weddings in 20 years' time. The EU on the other hand have been firm all along that the future arrangements could only be discussed once the terms of the initial split have been agreed. The debate was called ""parallelism versus sequentialism"" and from this afternoon's press conference and the announcement of the procedure it is clear that the UK has lost. Ministers believed they would be able to persuade the EU - the failure to do so has been described as a ""total cave-in"". The discussion was even predicted by Mr Davis as likely to be the ""row of the summer"". The row won't happen because it seems the UK has already given in. Read more from Laura Mr Barnier said a ""fair deal"" was possible ""and far better than no deal"". He promised to work with, not against, the UK. ""We must lift the uncertainty caused by Brexit,"" he said. The two men - who exchanged gifts at the start of the talks - set out the structure for the initial negotiations. There will be one week of negotiations every month. Working groups of ""senior experts"" will be set up to focus on the three main areas. On citizens' rights, which the UK has said should be an immediate priority, Mr Davis said there was ""much common ground"". The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote. Prior to the start of talks, Mr Davis gave his counterpart a first edition of a mountaineering book - a French-language version of Regards vers Annapurna - while Mr Barnier reciprocated with a traditional, hand-carved walking stick from Savoie, complete with leather wrist strap. Who's who in the UK delegation? After holding talks with Theresa May in Downing Street, new Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said there must be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and economic borders must be ""invisible"". While he said he regretted Mrs May's decision to leave the single market and customs union, he said the two had a shared objective to minimise disruption to trade after the UK's exit. Earlier former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose, who chaired the Stronger In campaign last year, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was reassured that economic considerations were ""top of the pile"" but ministers needed to be realistic with the public. Speaking on the same programme, JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin - one of the leading pro-Leave business voices - said negotiators had to be open to possible compromises but also prepared to walk away and to default to World Trade Organization rules if necessary. ""I don't think many people feel that staying in the single market and customs union and being subject to EU laws is Brexit. ""I think Brexit is parliamentary sovereignty and an assertion of democracy. Outside that, I think there is a quite a lot of scope,"" Mr Martin said. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""real confusion"" about the government's mandate after the general election result.",与英国展开第一轮谈判之后，欧盟首席谈判官表示，英国脱欧将会带来“实实在在”的后果。,"Brexit Secretary David Davis ""determined optimist"" after day one 米歇尔·巴尼耶（Michel Barnier）说，他目前没有打算“让步或者要求对方让步”。 英国脱欧事务大臣大卫·戴维斯（David Davis）表示，谈判已经有了一个“有希望的开始”。 英国似乎已经接受了欧盟所倾向的谈判程序，即贸易谈判不会立即开始。 在布鲁塞尔进行完首日谈判之后，戴维斯和巴尼耶举行了联合记者会。 谈判前期的焦点将是驻外人员权利、一份财政协议以及“其他分离问题”。 以保留《贝尔法斯特协议》（Belfast Agreement）和爱尔兰共同旅游地为目标的谈判也将开始，不过戴维斯表示，这些问题可能要等到整个程序结束，即英国与欧盟的贸易关系尘埃落定时，才会达成共识。 英国曾希望从一开始就同时谈判英国未来与欧盟的关系，但是巴尼耶表示，这只会发生在欧洲理事会（European Council）认为其他问题“已经得到充分进展”的时候。 戴维斯否认目前的时间表显示了英国的“弱点”，他坚称这一时间表与英国政府力求贸易与脱欧谈判并行的目标“完全一致”。 “重要的不是它什么时候开始，而是它如何结束，”他说。 巴尼耶被问到他是否对英国作出了任何相应的让步。他表示，离开欧盟是英国的决定，不是欧盟的决定，而任何一方都必须“为我们作出的决定承担责任和后果”。 “我目前的思维框架当中不打算让步或者要求对方让步，”他说。 “它不是要惩罚，不是要报复。” “基本上，我们是在执行英国的决定，让它离开欧盟、瓦解43年耐心建立的关系。” “在这样的一个大局内，我会尽我所能将情绪放到一边，坚持看事实，看数据和法律基础。并与英国合作，一同达到共识。” 谁说了算？ BBC政治事务编辑劳拉·昆斯伯格（Laura Kuennsberg） 它经常被比作一场离婚——英国想要在谈判房子和唱片收藏归谁的同时，讨论谁将为20年后孩子们的婚礼买单。 另一方面，欧盟一直都很坚持，未来的安排只会在离婚的条件达成一致之后才会开始讨论。 这场争论被称为“并行与先后”之争，而从这个下午的新闻发布会和所宣布的谈判程序来看，很明显，英国输了。 英国官员们曾相信他们有能力说服欧盟——而现在的失败被形容是“全面崩塌”。 戴维斯还曾经形容，这场讨论很可能是“今夏之争”。但从现在情况看，英国似乎已经屈服。 巴尼耶表示，达成一个“公平的协议”是有可能的，并且“比没有协议要好得多”。他承诺，将会与英国合作解决，而不是对抗。 “我们必须解除英国脱欧带来的不确定性，”他说。 英国脱欧大臣戴维斯和欧盟首席谈判官巴尼耶 两名代表在谈判开始时交换了礼物，他们列出了初期谈判的框架，每个月将会有一周进行谈判。 一些“资深专家”将会组成多个小组，集中讨论三个主要领域的问题。 关于英国认为应该属于最迫切议题的公民权利，戴维斯表示，双方有“很多共同立场”。 在去年的脱欧公投之后，英国设定在2019年3月底之前脱离欧洲联盟。 在谈判开始前，戴维斯向巴尼耶赠送了一部关于登山的书——法语版的《向安纳布尔纳峰致意》（Regards vers Annapurna），巴尼耶则回赠了一具来自萨瓦省的传统手工拐杖。"
"By Mike HillsVisual journalist Fast forward four months and the virus has spread across all 50 states, leaving a death toll of 100,000 from more than 1.6 million confirmed cases. We've taken a look at how those figures compare to other countries around the world and how the situation could develop over the next few months. How does the situation in the US compare? The death toll in the US became the highest in the world in early April and has risen dramatically since then. President Donald Trump initially said ""50 to 60,000"" people could die during the outbreak but in May he said he was hopeful the toll would be lower than 100,000. That benchmark has now been hit though and there are still about 1,000 deaths a day on average. Rather than focus on deaths, Mr Trump has preferred to cite the mortality rate - that is the number of people that have died relative to the country's population - as evidence that the US has dealt with the virus more effectively than some other nations. The chart below shows the countries with the highest death tolls and, to the right, their mortality rate. You can see that by that measure there are several countries where a greater proportion of the population has died during the coronavirus outbreak. Belgium, with a population of 11.5 million, has seen 82 people in every 100,000 die during its coronavirus outbreak while the US, with a population of around 330 million, has seen nearly 30 people in every 100,000 die. But if you look at New York - the worst-hit state in the US - the mortality rate there is close to 150 people in every 100,000, which shows that there is a lot of variation across the US. One of the problems with comparing countries is that many of them report deaths in different ways. Belgium, for instance, includes deaths where coronavirus was suspected of being present but was never confirmed with a test. Some US states record deaths this way, but not all. There have also been questions over whether official data from some countries can be trusted. Critics of China in particular have accused it of under-reporting the scale of its outbreak. Another issue is that countries could be at different stages of an outbreak. In many European countries it's clear that daily cases numbers are coming down significantly and they are past the peak. But you can't say the same for the US at the moment. New York over the worst, but is the US? Several countries in Europe had outbreaks around the same time as the US and all of them have seen the number of deaths grow quickly, peak and then fall away. The US has not. One of the reasons the number of daily deaths in the US has plateaued rather than fallen is the sheer size of the country - rather than one large outbreak, there have been multiple centres of infection that developed at different times and spread at different rates. In New York, the virus struck early, spread quickly and peaked in early April. In the rest of the US, however, the number of daily deaths has been slow to fall. Some other states that were badly affected early on, like Louisiana and Michigan, have also seen a substantial drop in the number of daily deaths like that in New York. But as the situation in those states has improved, others have worsened. About a third of all states saw more deaths last week compared to the week before, with Rhode Island, Mississippi and Ohio seeing some of the largest percentage increases. US leads the way in testing, but only now In recent weeks, President Trump has been keen to talk about the number of tests being done in the US. The most recent data says the US has carried out about 15 million so far. That figure puts the US way ahead of other countries, but when it comes to using testing to try to control the virus, there is more to it than the total number you've conducted. Countries that did a lot of testing early in the pandemic, and followed it up by tracing the contacts of anyone who was infected, have been most successful in slowing the spread. In South Korea, for example, they ramped up testing early on in the outbreak and managed to contain the virus. Less than 300 people have died with coronavirus in the country, which has a population of about 50 million. But as the chart above shows, it wasn't until several weeks after the first death in the US that officials really stepped up testing. The top US health official for infectious diseases, Anthony Fauci, admitted in early March that the testing system was ""currently failing"" and that the US was not able to supply tests ""easily, the way people in other countries are doing it"". The number of daily tests shows the US is well past those initial problems, but progress can still be made. If the 15m figure is accurate, that would still only be 4.5% of the population. So what happens next in the US? The death toll is still rising, albeit at a slower rate, and one model that has been cited by the White House predicts it could be at nearly 150,000 by August - although its projections have come in low in the past. One of the issues with making projections is that no one is quite sure what effect the gradual reopening of the US economy will have on the spread of the virus. At one point, more than 90% of the US population was under mandatory lockdown orders, but the majority of states have now begun to loosen their stay-at-home restrictions. The White House has outlined a set of criteria for states to meet before they begin reopening, including seeing a downward trajectory of case numbers for two weeks. But a group of public health experts say only a couple of states are hitting the targets. Dr Fauci has warned states that they will see ""little spikes that might turn into outbreaks"" if they reopen before getting the virus under control. But his advice has contradicted that of President Trump, who is keen to get the US economy restarted ahead of his re-election campaign. The latest figures show that nearly a quarter of the American workforce have lost their jobs since the outbreak began. Asked earlier this month whether lives would be lost to reopen the country, Mr Trump said: ""Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country opened and we have to get it open soon."" Even if states continue to ease restrictions, it's unclear whether the American public will be eager to return to shops and restaurants just yet. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that 70% of Americans were concerned that states would reopen too quickly.",美国发现第一起新冠病毒病例的两天后，美国总统特朗普说情况“完全得到控制”，并向公众保证情况“会好起来的”。四个月后，新冠病毒已蔓延到美国所有50个州，导致160万例确诊病例，10万人死亡。,我们将这些数据与世界其他国家的情况进行比较，看看未来几个月情况将如何发展。 美国的情况和其它地区比较情况怎样？ 美国的死亡人数在4月初成为全球最高水平，此后死亡人数急剧上升。 四月，特朗普在白宫的简报板上指向死亡率。 美国总统特朗普最初表示，疫情爆发期间可能有5至6万人死亡，但他在5月改口，他希望死亡人数可以低于10万。但现在死亡人数已经超越这个预期，美国平均每天仍有大约1000人死亡。 特朗普不愿只看死亡人数，而是更倾向于把死亡率（即相对于该国人口的死亡人数）作为证据，证明美国比其他一些国家更有效地应对病毒。 下图显示死亡人数最高的国家，以及右侧的死亡率。可以看到，通过这种方法，一些国家在新冠病毒爆发期间的死亡人口比例更高。 比利时有1150万人口，在新冠病毒爆发期间，每10万人中有80人死亡，而美国则有3.3亿人口，每10万人中有近30人死亡。 但如果看美国受病毒影响最严重的州，纽约州的死亡率，则每10万人中有近150人死亡，这表明美国各地的死亡率差异很大。 进行国家间比较的一大问题是许多国家确认新冠病例死亡的标准不同。例如，比利时的死亡包括未经检测的疑似病例造成的死亡。美国某些州以这种方式记录死亡人数，但并非全部州都如此。 对于某些国家的官方数据是否可以信任，也存在疑问。中国的批评者认为，中国低估了疫情爆发的规模。 另一问题是，不同国家可能处于疫情爆发的不同阶段。许多欧洲国家每日确诊病例数已达到高峰，正大幅下降。但目前还不能对美国下同样的结论。 纽约最糟糕时期已过，而美国呢？ 有几个欧洲国家和美国在同一时间爆发疫情，所有这些欧洲国家都呈现死亡人数迅速增加，达到顶峰然后消失的趋势。但美国没有。 美国每天的死亡人数稳定而不是下降的一大原因跟美国的绝对规模有关。美国不是一次全国大爆发，而是呈现多个感染中心并在不同时间段以不同速度传播。 在纽约，新冠病毒出现较早，随后迅速传播，并于4月初达到高峰。但在美国其他地区，每日死亡人数的下降速度却很缓慢。 像路易斯安那州和密歇根州这样的其他早期受到严重影响的州，和纽约一样，每天的死亡人数也大大减少。 但随着这些州的情况有所改善，其他州情况则恶化。与上周相比，美国三分之一州的死亡人数在增加，而罗德岛州、密西西比州和俄亥俄州的增长率很高。 美国在检测方面处于领先地位，但只是现在 最近几周特朗普特别热衷于谈论美国的检测能力。 最近几周，特朗普一直热衷谈论美国进行的检测数量。最新数据显示，到目前为止，美国已进行1500万次检测。 这个数字使美国领先于其他国家，但在使用检测来控制病毒方面，它能做的比检测的总数还多。 在大流行初期进行大量检测并追踪感染者的密切接触者的国家，在减缓病毒传播方面最成功。 例如韩国在爆发初期就加强测试，并设法控制病毒。韩国人口约5000万，死于新冠病毒的人数不到300。 但正如上图所示，美国首例病例死亡几周后官员们才真正加强检测。 美国最高级别的传染病卫生官员安东尼·福西（Anthony Fauci）在3月初承认检测系统“目前正在失效”，美国无法“轻易提供其他国家的人们所做的检测”。 每日检测的次数表明，美国已远远超过最初的问题，但仍可以取得进展。如果1500万的数据准确无误，那说明这仅占人口的4.5％。 未来美国会发生什么？ 5月初，美国一些州发生了反对”居家令”的抗议活动 尽管美国死亡人数的增长速度较慢，但​​死亡人数仍在增加，白宫引用的一种模型预测，到8月美国的死亡人数可能接近15万，尽管此前的预测值较低。 这种预测的问题之一是，没有人完全确定美国经济的逐步开放将对病毒的传播产生怎样的影响。 一方面，超过90％的美国人口受到强制封锁的命令，但是大多数州现在已经开始放宽对家庭住所的限制。 白宫为各州在重启前列出了一系列标准，比如要满足确诊人数连续两周下降。但一些公共卫生专家说，只有几个州达标。 美国国家过敏与传染病研究所所长福西警告说，如果在疫情受控前重启，他们将看到“可能会爆发的小高峰”。 但福西的建议与特朗普的相矛盾。特朗普热衷于在连任前重新启动美国经济。最新数据显示，自疫情爆发以来，近四分之一的美国劳动力处于失业状态。 在本月初被问及是否会以失去生命为代价重启美国时，特朗普说：“会不会有人受严重影响？会。但我们必须让我们的国家重启，我们必须尽快让它重启。” 即使各州继续放宽限制，也不清楚美国公众是否会急于到商店和饭店消费。皮尤研究中心（Pew Research Center）最近进行的一项民意调查发现，有70％的美国人担心各州重启的速度过快。
"By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent For the US, this highly secret operation, conducted without informing the Pakistan government, was both payback and a form of closure for the 9/11 attacks of 2001. For Pakistan, it was both a national insult and an embarrassment. Bin Laden, or ""OBL"" as he became known in the West, had been discovered living comfortably just 31 miles (50km) from the capital, Islamabad, and almost under the nose of Pakistan's Military Academy in Abbottabad. But five years on from that dawn raid, later dramatised by Hollywood in the film Zero Dark Thirty, violent jihadism is still very much a global phenomenon. The last 12 months have seen jihadist attacks on almost every continent - in Europe, America, the Middle East, South East Asia and Africa. So how much of this is Osama Bin Laden's legacy and what will be his lasting impact, if any, on the world? How the lives of Osama Bin Laden's neighbours changed forever Bin Laden: The long hunt for the al-Qaeda leader Was killing legal? Was Bin Laden still in charge of al-Qaeda? In pictures: Osama Bin Laden's life Bin Laden files: Seven things we learned ""Bin Laden's death did leave a legacy,"" says Dr Sajjan Gohel, of the Asia Pacific Foundation, ""but to some extent, it has been usurped by Isis (so-called Islamic State, also known as IS) who have taken over and built on his goals for creating a transnational terrorist project"". To many people, the 22-year-long era of Bin Laden's al-Qaeda from 1989 to 2011 might not seem that different from the violent ideology of today's IS. Both groups have espoused a narrow-minded, intolerant version of the Islamic religion, casting anyone - even other Sunni Muslims - as apostates if they do not share their world view. They both use suicide bombings and mass murder of civilians as tactics and they both reject the concept of democracy as being incompatible with Sharia, Islamic law. Longer-term strategy Yet they are different and if OBL - or Abu Abdullah as he was known to his followers - were alive today he would almost certainly have disapproved of the actions and timing of IS. Bin Laden's strategy was a patient, long-term, generational one. He was hoping that 9/11 and other spectacular attacks would so demoralise the US and the West that they would abandon their support for secular Arab regimes in the Middle East, paving the way for an eventual takeover by jihadists and the creation of an Islamic caliphate. He saw this as being perhaps decades away and probably not in his natural lifetime. Even before his death, there were indications that OBL and the al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan disagreed with the extreme violence being employed by al-Qaeda's Iraqi franchise which went on to become the modern-day IS. Osama Bin Laden: Obituary: Osama Bin Laden ""IS has gone in different directions from Bin Laden's al-Qaeda,"" says Dr Gohel. ""It deliberately kills Sunni Muslims, including women and children. (IS has carried out several mosque bombings in Saudi Arabia, killing Sunni and Shia alike). ""It also engages in criminal activity, human trafficking and is open to recruiting women, all of which al-Qaeda was opposed to."" Years from now, historians will most likely conclude that the death of Osama Bin Laden in that pre-dawn US raid on 2 May 2011 dealt a near-fatal blow to the organisation he came to represent. His successor, Dr Ayman Al-Zawahiri, is a dull, bespectacled Egyptian ideologue devoid of charisma. His long, wordy speeches are in marked contrast to the snappy use of social media and the internet by today's generation of IS operatives. The controversial CIA-run programme of drone strikes in Pakistan's Tribal Territories has kept what is left of Bin Laden's organisation constantly looking over its shoulders, inhibiting its ability to plan a repeat of the London bombings. Al-Qaeda's regional franchises, like Al-Shabaab in Somalia and AQAP in Yemen, have largely been left to develop by themselves. Watershed moment Richard Clarke, who was President George W Bush's counter-terrorism chief until 2003, believes that regardless of what followed, the death of Bin Laden marked a watershed. ""I think there was a propaganda effect right away,"" he says. ""As long as he was alive, the Americans looked impotent but the longer term effect (of his death) was that al-Qaeda Central, their headquarters, never really recovered. Al-Qaeda as a multinational organisation doesn't really exist."" Yet without such a single, identifiable target as OBL, today's IS presents a more diffuse and difficult target for the US to hit. Its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, rarely surfaces and IS will have anyway planned long ago for his demise. In recent days, the US presidential hopeful Donald Trump has vowed to destroy IS, without saying how. But as the global effort grinds on to defeat or at least contain violent Islamic extremism, the absence of such a charismatic figure as OBL was to his followers makes it unlikely that such a decisive one-off moment as his death five years ago will ever be repeated.",5月2日是本·拉登毙命5周年，这个“世界上头号被通缉的恐怖分子”在巴基斯坦一座别墅中被美国海军突击队击毙。,没有像本拉登这样的著名显著的领导人和目标，现在美国面临的问题寻找分散的打击目标更难。 美国在没有通知巴基斯坦政府的情况下进行的这次高度机密的行动是对2001年9/11恐怖攻击的一个交代，也是一次报复行动。但对于巴基斯坦来说，那是一次国家蒙受的侮辱。 本·拉登在距离巴基斯坦首都伊斯兰堡50公里的郊外被发现，在阿伯塔巴德（Abbottabad）的巴基斯坦军事学院的眼皮下面在过着舒适的生活。 但是本·拉登被击毙5年后，突袭的过程被好莱坞拍成了电影，但是充满暴力的圣战仍然是个全球现象 。在过去12个月中，全球各大洲都有圣战者发动的攻击。 这里有多少是本·拉登的遗产，本·拉登是否仍对世界造成持续影响？ 亚洲太平洋基金会的高赫尔博士说，本·拉登之死确实留下了后遗症，但是在某种程度上，这种影响被“伊斯兰国”接替，“伊斯兰国”在本·拉登目标的基础上扩展垮国家的恐怖组织。 对许多人来说，从1989到2011年本·拉登领导基地组织22年中，他们的理想同今天的“伊斯兰国”似乎没有不同。 基地组织和“伊斯兰国”都支持狭隘的、缺少宽容的伊斯兰宗教，把那些不认同他们世界观的穆斯林，甚至逊尼穆斯林视作叛逆。 本拉登被发现在距离巴基斯坦首都伊斯兰堡50公里的郊外，在Abbottabad的巴基斯坦军事学院的眼皮下面在过着舒适的生活。 他们都使用自杀炸弹攻击和屠杀平民的战术，都反对民主理念，认为民主同伊斯兰法格格不入。 长期战略 不过他们也有所不同。如果本·拉登现在还活着，他几乎肯定不会同意“伊斯兰国”采取的行动以及选择的时机。本·拉登的策略是耐心、长期、而且有世代相传的特点。 本·拉登希望9/11和其他大规模攻击能够打击美国和西方的士气，让他们放弃对中东世俗阿拉伯政权的支持，最终圣战者可以取而代之，建立伊斯兰哈里发国。 本·拉登认为要实现这个目标可能需要数十年时间，可能在他有生之年也实现不了。在本·拉登被击毙之前，已经有迹象表明巴基斯坦的基地组织领导人不同意伊拉克基地组织，也就是“伊斯兰国”的前身，采取的极端暴力手法。 分水岭 在2003年前一直担任美国布什总统的反恐负责人的理查德·克拉克认为，本·拉登之死是个标志性事件，首先美国取得了宣传效果。 他说，本·拉登活着让美国显得无能为力，而本·拉登之死的长期效果是，基地组织的中枢部分没有得到恢复，而基地组织作为一个多国组织实际上已经不复存在。 但是没有像本·拉登这样的明显的领导人和目标，现在美国面临的问题是，寻找分散的打击目标更难。基地组织现任领导人Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi很少露面，而且“伊斯兰国”也一直谋求置他于死地。 最近美国总统候选人特朗普发誓，要摧毁“伊斯兰国”，但是他没有说明如何做到这点。 在全球努力打击伊斯兰极端主义之际，没有一个像本·拉登这样的对其追随者有魅力的人物，今后就很难再出现类似5年前击毙本·拉登那样的决定性的时刻。 (编译：横路；责编：路西)
"The aid agency has had no contact with the gunmen, an ICRC spokesman says. Earlier, Syrian state media said gunmen had opened fire on Red Cross staff travelling on the road between Sarmin and Saraqeb in Idlib province. The ICRC says it has been struggling to gain access across Syria to provide aid to injured and displaced people. Appeal A convoy carrying six ICRC staff members and one Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteer was intercepted by unidentified armed gunmen near the town of Saraqeb in Idlib province, ICRC spokeswoman Rima Kamal told the BBC. ""We call for the immediate release of the seven colleagues abducted this morning... who work tirelessly to provide assistance to those most in need in Syria. Incidents such as this one unfortunately will undermine our capacity to assist those who need our help,"" she said. The ICRC has declined to reveal the identity, gender or nationality of the abducted workers but they are believed to include both local and international staff, who are mainly medical specialists. Syrian state news agency Sana earlier quoted an unnamed official as saying the workers were abducted and taken to an unknown location after gunmen blocked their path and shot at their convoy. The aid agency did not confirm whether shots had been fired, but said the team's vehicles were also missing. An ICRC statement said the vehicles they were travelling in had been clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem, ""which is not a religious symbol"". Another ICRC spokesman, Simon Schorno, told Associated Press the attack took place at around 11:30 (08:30 GMT) on Sunday as the team was returning to Damascus. He said the team had been in the field since 10 October to assess the medical situation and deliver aid in what he described as ""a difficult area to go in"". It is not yet clear who carried out the kidnapping, but Syrian state TV blamed it on what it called ""armed terrorists"" - a term it frequently uses to describe anti-government rebels. Hardline Islamist rebels are known to operate in the area, says the BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut. Kidnappings, particularly of aid workers and journalists, have become increasingly common in the north, where much of the countryside has fallen into rebel hands. In August, the ICRC said the number of Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteers who had lost their lives since the start of the conflict had risen to 22. The abductions will clearly complicate further the already difficult and dangerous task of providing humanitarian aid to all parts of the country, he adds, at a time when the UN is pressing all sides to allow freer access. On Saturday, the Syrian government began the evacuation of around 1,500 civilians, mainly women and children, from a rebel-held Damascus suburb besieged by the army for months. Many of those coming out of Muadhamiya, south-west of Damascus, were said to be exhausted and traumatised. In a separate development, the state news agency said two car bombs exploded on Sunday evening near the state TV building in Damascus. The TV headquarters in the capital's Umayyad Square was reportedly damaged in the attack, but there was no immediate word on casualties, the agency reported. More than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011, according to the UN. Earlier this month, the UN estimated that more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes by the country's civil war by the end of 2014.",国际红十字会称，一组武装分子在叙利亚西北部绑架了6名红十字会工作人员及另一名红新月会志愿者。,国际红十字会指出，在叙利亚从事救援任务日益危险和困难。 红十字会发言人说，他们目前还没有与绑架者取得联系； 发言人指出，向叙利亚各地运送救护人员以便向战火中的难民提供援助的工作已经变得日益困难。 国际红十字还呼吁绑架者尽快无条件释放红十字和红新月会工作人员。 早些时候，叙利亚政府媒体报道称，有反政府武装组织向公路上行驶的红十字会车辆开枪。 国际红十字会表示，所有遭到绑架的红十字会人员事发时都乘坐明显标明红十字和红新月标志的车辆。 伏击事件 据悉，遭遇绑架的一队红十字工作人员是在完成一项救助任务后返回大马士革途中遇伏的。 目前不清楚是哪个或哪些组织参与了这次伏击绑架行动。 叙利亚官方电视称绑架者是“武装恐怖分子”。 BBC驻贝鲁特记者缪尔介绍说，事发地区存在着一些反政府伊斯兰极端主义武装。 最新绑架事件进一步显示在叙利亚从事人道援助的危险与困难。 上个月，联合国统计称自从2014年叙利亚内战开始以来，至少有800万叙利亚人因战乱流离失所。 （编译/责编： 晧宇）
"The initiative, which is called Time's Up, was announced via a full-page advert printed in the New York Times. The Hollywood project is described as a ""unified call for change from women in entertainment for women everywhere"". It comes in the wake of sexual abuse allegations by high-profile actresses against film producer Harvey Weinstein. Legal funding The campaign, which is backed by hundreds of actresses including Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon, Cate Blanchett, Eva Longoria and Emma Stone, has already raised more than $13m (£9.6m) of its $15m target. The money raised will be used to fund legal support for both female and male victims of sexual harassment at work. The project is aimed primarily at those who are unable to meet the payments to defend themselves, such as agricultural or factory workers, caretakers and waitresses. In a ""solidarity letter"" published on its website, Time's Up says the ""struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard"" must end, adding: ""Time's up on this impenetrable monopoly."" The letter, which is aimed at ""every woman... who has had to fend off sexual advances"", goes on to say that such harassment can often continue because ""perpetrators and employers never face any consequences"". It also calls for ""gender inequality and the imbalance of power"" to be addressed, stressing the need for more women to gain positions of authority and parity of pay. In December, Time magazine named ""the Silence Breakers"" - women and men who spoke out against sexual abuse and harassment - as its ""Person of the Year"" for 2017. Last year also saw the rise of the #MeToo hashtag, which inspired a global movement of women and men to share their stories of sexual abuse and harassment. The term gained momentum after actress Alyssa Milano took to Twitter to ask victims of sexual assault to come forward in a show of solidarity. Between October and December 2017, the hashtag was used on Twitter and Facebook more than six million times.",超过300名女演员、作家和导演启动了一个项目，以求打击电影业内和其他工作场所的性骚扰。,多名美国女演员，包括娜塔莉·波特曼、艾玛·斯通和凯特·布兰切特均支持这个打击性骚扰的运动 这项目名为“时间够了”（Time's Up），通过在纽约时报上刊登的整版广告宣布成立。它被形容为“全球女性娱乐圈女性统一呼吁”。 早前有多名荷里活演员、导演、制片人等被指过去曾性骚扰其他人，包括制片人哈维·温斯坦（Harvey Weinstein）和奥斯卡影帝凯文·斯派西（Kevin Spacey）。 法律资助 Time's Up在其网站上发表的“团结信”中表示女性争取进入行业、争取晋升以及争取发声的权力十分困难，信件指“是时候打破这种牢不可破的垄断”。 这封信称是发给“每个不得不抵挡性骚扰的女人”。信件说这样的骚扰往往会持续下去，因为“肇事者和雇主从不面临任何后果”。 签署了信件的女明星包括娜塔莉·波特曼（Natalie Portman）、瑞茜·威瑟斯彭（Reese Witherspoon）、凯特·布兰切特（Cate Blanchett）、伊娃•朗格（Eva Longoria）和艾玛·斯通（Emma Stone）。这项活动已经筹集了超过1300万美元（合960万英镑）。筹款目标是1500万美元。 筹集的资金将用于资助工作中性骚扰受害者的法律支持，包括男性和女性。 该项目主要帮助那些无力支付保护自己所需开支的人，如农业或工厂工人、看管人员和女服务员。 信件还呼吁要解决“性别不平等和权力失衡问题”，强调社会需要晋升更多女性到具影响力的地置，也需要给她们平等的待遇。 Netflix 影视网因男演员斯派西（右）性丑闻而叫停热播剧目《纸牌屋》 哈维·韦恩斯坦稍早前已被英国电影和电视艺术学院（BAFTA）暂停会籍 去年12月，时代杂志将2017年“年度人物”颁给“打破沉默的人”，即是那些公开指责性侵犯和性骚扰的人。 去年也有#MeToo标签崛起，激发了全球男女分享他们的性虐待和骚扰故事的运动。 美国女演员艾莉莎·米兰诺（Alyssa Milano）在推特上利用这标签向性侵犯受害者提出声援后，广为流传。在2017年10月和12月之间，这个标签Twitter和Facebook上被使用了超过六百万次。
"The Driven group also plans to try out a fleet of autonomous vehicles between London and Oxford. The cars will communicate with each other about any hazards and should operate with almost full autonomy - but will have a human on board as well. Previous tests of driverless vehicles in the UK have mainly taken place at slow speeds and not on public roads. The Driven consortium is led by Oxbotica, which makes software for driverless vehicles. Founder Prof Paul Newman, of Oxford University, said: ""We're moving from the singleton autonomous vehicle to fleets of autonomous vehicles - and what's interesting is what data the vehicles share with one another, when, and why."" The project is backed by an £8.6m government grant and involves an insurance company, which will assess the risks involved at each stage of the journey. The UK government has committed about £100m in total towards autonomous driving projects and has said it wants Britain to ""lead the way in developing"" the tech. But one expert said the country risks falling behind what is being done abroad. ""Britain is trying to keep up, but the big development in the field is going on elsewhere,"" said Prof David Bailey from Aston Business School. ""That includes Google in the US, Volvo in China and Daimler in Germany. ""And amounts being committed [by the UK] are relatively small beer. ""The Obama government, for example, proposed spending billions of dollars over 10 years."" Calum Chace, author of Surviving AI, agreed that the UK appears to have fallen behind. ""I don't know why we have to wait until 2019,"" he said. ""But in a way it doesn't matter how aggressively the UK pushes this tech.

"Latest figures show net migration rose to 176,000 - up from 153,000 people in the year to September 2012. The increase appears to buck the trend of a decline in net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to and leaving the country. Prime Minister David Cameron wants to get UK net migration below 100,000 before the next election in 2015. The increase was driven by a change in the number of people who left Britain. In the year to September 2012, 342,000 moved abroad. But fewer people left the UK in the year to December 2012. Over the same period, the number of immigrants arriving in the country remained virtually unchanged. The difference between these two factors meant that net migration rose - although it did not climb back above the level it was at in December 2011. 'Out of options' Immigration minister Mark Harper said net migration was however down by a third since its peak in 2010. He added that a new immigration bill coming into force in the autumn would make it more difficult for people to come into Britain if they had no right to do so and would make it easier to remove people who were not entitled to stay in the country. ""We are committed to bringing net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands,"" Mr Harper said. ""We are working across government to protect public services and ensure our welfare system is not open to abuse."" Shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said the figures were ""a blow"" to the home secretary. ""Theresa May's focus on net migration, which has gone wrong in these figures, has also meant the government is failing badly on illegal immigration, which is a major concern to the public and is getting worse and worse with fewer people being stopped at the border, absconsions up and deportations down. ""Immigration needs to be controlled, but we must recognise there is immigration that works for Britain and immigration that doesn't."" But the pressure group Migrationwatch UK said that the detail of the latest figures showed the government was succeeding in cutting immigration from outside the EU - and that further reductions in net migration could come by ensuring that people leave when they should. Sir Andrew Green, Migrationwatch's chairman, said: ""It is far too early on the basis of one quarter's figures to call this a setback to the government's policy. Student interviews and measures to ensure that students leave when they should will make a substantial difference."" Sarah Mulley, of the centre-left think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the statistics suggested the government was running out of options to meet its target. ""Recent declines have been driven in large part by falling numbers of international students, which has come at a high economic cost, but this trend now appears to be levelling off,"" she said. Other figures released in the report include:",据英国政府公布的最新数字，截至2012年底，英国净移民人数有所增加。,净移民人数是指从英国移民到外国与从外国移民到英国的人数之间的差距。 净移民人数是指从英国移民到外国与从外国移民到英国的人数之间的差距。 最新数字显示，净移民人数截至到2012年9月从15.3万增加到17.6万。 这个数字的增加似乎扭转了英国净移民人数不断下降的趋势。 英国首相卡梅伦希望把英国净移民人数在2015年大选前限制在10万。 净移民人数增加是因为离开英国到外国移民的人数有所下降，在截至到2012年底的一年中，这个数字从35.1万下降到32.1万。 数据显示，在同一时期，进入英国的移民人数从56.6万下降到49.7万。 BBC英国国内事务记者说，净移民人数增加的原因比较复杂，部分原因是离开英国到其他国家移民的人数比政府预期的要低。 如果离开英国的人越来越少，即便进入英国的移民人数减少，英国的净移民人数仍然会增加。 （编译：董乐 责编：尚清）

"The four pictures show the princess being cradled by her elder sibling as they sit on a cream couch at Anmer Hall in Norfolk, their family home with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The pictures were taken by Catherine just weeks after Princess Charlotte was born on 2 May. In an earlier tweet, Kensington Palace said the images were ""very special"". In each of the pictures, Charlotte is lying on her brother's lap, wearing white. The prince is wearing a white shirt, blue shorts and blue socks. In one, he appears to be kissing his sister on the forehead. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children have been at Anmer Hall since leaving London shortly after the birth of the princess. Prince William and Catherine are expected to be based there for the next few years as they raise Princess Charlotte and Prince George, who is almost two, with the help of a full-time nanny. Photography is listed as one of the duchess's hobbies in her biography on the royal website. The pictures were taken on a Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera. The first official images of Prince George, released in 2013, were taken by the duchess's father, Michael Middleton, in the garden of their home in Bucklebury, Berkshire. Commentary: BBC Royal Correspondent Peter Hunt The photographs provide a rare glimpse of, as things stand, the future of the British monarchy. Such glimpses will remain reasonably rare as these royal children grow up. They'll next be captured together when Princess Charlotte is christened in July. In all of these four images the baby princess - just a few weeks old at the time the photos were taken by her mother - is in the arms of her brother, Prince George. As the toddler destined to be king continues to adjust to having a new addition to his family, his parents will hope the 22-month-old and the one-month-old will forge a bond as strong as the one enjoyed by Princes William and Harry. Harry has spoken of how they understand each other and give each other support. His older brother told someone recently that George was very lively and Charlotte had given her parents a ""few sleepless nights"". Read more from Peter on his correspondent page On Friday, it was announced Princess Charlotte will be christened on 5 July. The christening will take place at St Mary Magdalene Church at the Queen's Sandringham estate. Princess Charlotte was born on 2 May at London's St Mary's Hospital, weighing 8lbs 3oz (3.7kg).

"By Nick HopkinsInvestigations correspondent, BBC Newsnight The secret initiative, put forward two years ago, was the brainchild of the then most senior UK military officer, General Sir David Richards. It was considered by the PM and the National Security Council, as well as US officials, but was deemed too risky. The UK government did not respond to a request for comment. Lord Richards, as he is now, believed his proposal could stem the civilian bloodshed in Syria as rebels fought troops loyal to Mr Assad. The idea was considered by David Cameron and Dominic Grieve, the attorney general, and sent to the National Security Council, Whitehall sources said. It was also put to senior figures in Washington, including General Martin Dempsey, the US's most senior military officer. While it was thought to be too radical at the time, US President Barack Obama said last week he was seeking $500m (£291m) funding to train Syrian rebels - an echo of Lord Richards' plan. Insiders have told BBC Newsnight that Lord Richards, then chief of the defence staff but since retired from the military, warned Downing Street there were only two ways to end the Syrian civil war quickly - to let President Assad win, or to defeat him. 'Extract, equip, train' With ministers having pledged not to commit British ""boots on the ground"", his initiative proposed vetting and training a substantial army of moderate Syrian rebels at bases in Turkey and Jordan. Mr Cameron was told the ""extract, equip, train"" plan would involve an international coalition. It would take a year, but this would buy time for an alternative Syrian government to be formed in exile, the PM was told. Once the Syrian force was ready, it would march on Damascus, with the cover of fighter jets from the West and Gulf allies. The plan envisaged a ""shock and awe"" campaign, similar to the one that routed Saddam's military in 2003, but spearheaded by Syrians. Opportunity 'missed' Though the plan was put to one side at the time, Mr Cameron was later persuaded to consider military action when evidence emerged of chemical weapons use in Syria. However, MPs voted against giving authority for a direct intervention last August. The US and UK accused the Assad government of being behind the attacks, but Damascus blamed rebel groups. Monzer Akbik, spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition, an opposition alliance, said: ""The international community did not intervene to prevent those crimes and at the same time did not actively support the moderate elements on the ground. ""A huge opportunity was missed and that opportunity could have saved tens of thousands of lives actually and could have saved also a huge humanitarian catastrophe."" 'No good options' Professor Michael Clarke, of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, added: ""We have missed the opportunity to train an anti-Assad force that would have real influence in Syria when he is removed, as he will be. ""I think there was an opportunity two or three years ago to have become involved in a reasonably positive way, but it was dangerous and swimming against the broader tide of history… and the costs and the uncertainties were very high."" He said it was now too late for the West to get involved. ""Western policymakers in a sense have got to have the courage to do nothing and to work on what comes after the civil war,"" he said. ""There are no good options over Syria. It is a slow-motion road accident."" Tens of thousands of people have died and millions more have been displaced in three years of civil war in Syria.",BBC《新闻之夜》节目披露，英国政府曾计划训练和武装10万名叙利亚叛军，以击败阿萨德总统。,曾任北约在阿富汗的指挥官的英国国防总参谋长里查德勋爵。 这一秘密计划是在两年前由当时英国的最高军事官员大卫•里查德将军提出的。 英国首相和英国国家安全委员会以及美国官员，都对该计划进行过考虑，但最终觉得风险太大而被搁置。 英国政府没有对这一揭示作出评论。 现已被封为勋爵的里查德将军认为，他的建议可以阻止叙利亚的流血冲突。 当时叙利亚反叛力量正在与效忠于阿萨德总统的军队作战。 英国政府的消息来源称，首相卡梅伦和司法大臣多米尼克•格里夫都对这一建议进行了考虑，该计划还被送交英国国家安全委员会考虑。 华盛顿的资深官员和美国最高军事指挥官，包括参谋长联席会议主席马丁•登普西上将都对这一计划进行过研究。 尽管当时该计划被认为过于激进，但美国总统奥巴马上周表示，他正在要求国会批准，拨款五亿美元资助训练叙利亚的反叛力量。 了解内情的消息人士告诉BBC《新闻之夜》节目，当时担任英国国防总参谋长的里查德勋爵曾警告英国政府，要快速结束叙利亚内战只有两条路：要么让阿萨德总统赢，要么击败他。 由于英国政府部长保证不向叙利亚派兵，曾任北约在阿富汗的指挥官的里查德勋爵建议，在土耳其和约旦的基地大规模筛选和培训叙利亚反政府武装。 整个计划将持续一年，但这段时间可以让叙利亚反对派在海外组建一个流亡政府。 一旦这支叙利亚叛军准备就绪，就可以在西方和海湾盟国的战机掩护下向大马士革进军。 尽管该计划在当时被搁置在一旁，但后来有证据显示叙利亚使用化学武器时，有人又劝说卡梅伦首相考虑对叙利亚采取军事行动。 不过，英国议会在去年8月投票，否决了对叙利亚采取直接军事干预的提案。 （编译：嵇伟 责编：尚清）
"Home Secretary Priti Patel said the UK was still at ""a high level of threat"" and an attack could ""occur without further warning"". The terrorism threat is now at its lowest since August 2014. Substantial is the third of five ratings at which the threat level can stand. The separate terrorism threat level for Northern Ireland remains ""severe"". Ms Patel said in a statement on Monday that terrorism remained a ""direct and immediate"" risk to the UK's national security. Assessments determining the country's threat level are taken by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) - part of MI5 - which makes its recommendations independently from the government. ""Government, police and intelligence agencies will continue to work tirelessly to address the threat posed by terrorism in all its forms,"" Ms Patel said. The threat level is kept under ""constant review"", she added. Neil Basu, head of counter terrorism policing, said there had been ""positive developments"" in the fight against terrorism but it was ""vital that we all maintain a high level of vigilance"". He said the UK's counter terrorism policing team had about 800 live counter terrorism investigations - while 24 attack plots had been thwarted since the Westminster attack in March 2017. This is a significant change in the only official public measure of the threat posed by terrorism to the UK - but it's not a sign that there are suddenly fewer people with aspirations to do us harm. The security services are still monitoring thousands of ""subjects of interest"" - the top-tier of would-be plotters from jihadist groups to the far-right. Many of these people are very dangerous because, in the jargon, they are ""lone actors"" bent on DIY violence. But what appears to have changed is the resources and capability available to IS-supporting plotters who need help. Quite simply, a huge number of the foreign fighters who played a key role linking these followers to resources and support died on the battlefields of the militant group's last stand. Continuing propaganda from the survivors, portraying IS as a force to be reckoned with, also has less credibility for would-be recruits. And so it has become harder - for now at least - for some of those with intent to get the help they need to carry out their aspirations. The UK's terrorism threat level was raised to the highest rating, ""critical"", in the days following the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017. It last reached this level again briefly in September that year, after a bomb partially exploded on a Tube train at Parsons Green. The threat level had remained at the second highest rating, ""severe"", until Monday. The Northern Ireland threat level specifically refers to threat to the country from Northern Ireland-related terrorism. It remains at severe - the second-highest level. The five levels of threat set by the JTAC are:",英国内政部把全国面临的国际恐怖袭击威胁级别提高到“严峻”，仅次于最高级别“危急”。,特雷莎·梅在记者会上表示，没有情报显示英国即刻会发生恐怖袭击，提高警戒级别是应对伊拉克和叙利亚局势。 这意味着遭受恐怖袭击的可能性“极高”。 内政大臣特雷莎·梅在记者会上说，没有情报显示“随时”可能发生恐怖袭击。 她说，提高威胁程度的级别，是针对伊拉克和叙利亚局势做出的反应。 英国2011年7月把恐怖袭击威胁级别下调到“显著”。 英国联合反恐分析中心（JTAC）负责确定全国面临遭受恐怖袭击的威胁级别；各行各界的保安部门根据这个级别做出相应的保安部署。 根据内政部资料，恐怖袭击威胁程度分为五级，自上而下分别是危急、严峻、显著、中等、轻微。 （编译：郱书 / 责编：路西）
"The fishing boat, carrying about 350 people of the Muslim Rohingya minority, has been refused entry to Thailand. Those on board told the BBC the crew abandoned them and disabled the engine. They said the bodies of those who had died were thrown overboard. Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have been turning away migrant boats. 'Desperate sight' Several thousand people are still believed to be stuck in boats off the coasts of Thailand and Malaysia. Most are Rohingya Muslims who cannot go back to Myanmar, also known as Burma, where they are not recognised as citizens of the country and are regularly persecuted. Some of those who are adrift in the Andaman Sea have been provided with food, water and medicine by the Thai navy. It is not clear how many other boats are in a similar predicament. Some boats containing migrants have been towed over to the Malaysian side of the border - where most migrants want to go - only to be taken back into Thai waters. No-one wants them, the BBC's Jonathan Head says, and seeing them off the southern coast of Thailand, near Koh Lipe, that it is a ""desperate sight"" as they beg for food and water. On one crowded vessel with a lot of women and children on board, our correspondent saw people drinking their own urine from bottles. The migrants - including 50 women and 84 children - said they had been at sea for three months. Their situation became critical when their crew abandoned them without a working engine six days ago anchored near the Thai-Malaysian border. Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division told the BBC: ""They're [Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia] playing a game of marine ping-pong not wanting to take in the Rohingyas. He said it was necessary for the three countries to work together in rescuing them before they decide who is going to take responsibility for them. ""This is an urgent humanitarian crisis and the Thais and others seem to be taking a gentle stroll."" Who are the Rohingyas? Myanmar's unwanted people As many as 8,000 migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar are believed by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to be stranded at sea. People smugglers are reportedly refusing to land their boats because their usual route through Thailand has been disrupted by a government crackdown. It was launched after the discovery of dozens of bodies in abandoned camps along the land route. A senior Thai official reiterated on Wednesday that Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia would all continue to turn the boats away. On Sunday and Monday more than 2,000 migrants arrived in Malaysia or Indonesia after being rescued or swimming ashore. The journey the migrants take - from Bangladesh or Myanmar through the Bay of Bengal to Thailand or beyond - takes several weeks and has been made by Rohingyas for much of the last 10-15 years.

"In an open letter, the firm warned that its YouTube and Search features could be ""dramatically worse"" if new rules were brought in. It also added that users' data could be shared. But the Australian competition regulator said Google's letter was ""misinformation"". Over the past few months, the Australian government has been preparing legislation which will make Google and Facebook pay local publishers for their content. Today, Google has said it will fight the regulation which the government says is designed to create ""a level playing field"" for news outlets. In an open letter, Google's Australia managing director Mel Silva, wrote: ""The way Aussies search every day on Google is at risk from new regulation. ""You've always relied on Google Search and YouTube to show you what's most relevant and helpful to you. We could no longer guarantee that under this law."" Google Search and YouTube services would be ""dramatically worse"" and the new regulation ""could lead to your data being handed over to big news businesses"", Ms Silva said. What are the proposals? Last month, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission published draft legislation which called on internet companies such as Facebook and Google to pay for content. It would allow news companies to negotiate as a bloc with tech giants for content which appears in their news feeds and search results. The draft code covers other matters too, including notifying news companies of changes to algorithms. Penalties could be up to A$10m (£5m; $7m) per breach, or 10% of the company's local turnover. Today, the competition regulator said Google's open letter ""contains misinformation"" about the proposed law. ""Google will not be required to charge Australians for the use of its free services such as Google Search and YouTube, unless it chooses to do so,"" Rod Sims, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman said in a statement. ""Google will not be required to share any additional user data with Australian news businesses unless it chooses to do so."" Mr Sims said the new regulations would ""address a significant bargaining power imbalance"" between Australian news media and internet organisations. ""A healthy news media sector is essential to a well-functioning democracy,"" he added.",澳大利亚联邦议会正寻求通过一部新法律，强制大型网络企业与当地新闻出版商分享版税。美国网络巨头谷歌（Google）警告，一旦新法落实，该公司将中断对澳洲的搜寻引擎服务。,谷歌表明一旦堪培拉通过有关法律，该公司就会面向澳大利亚关闭搜索引擎服务。 这份立法草案建议让谷歌、脸书（Facebook）甚至更多科企必须先向媒体机构付钱，才能展示新闻内容，被视为一份标志性立法草案。 谷歌公司反驳，新法只会费时失事，尤其是政府居中协调科企与新闻企业议价的机制。谷歌澳大利亚总裁梅尔·席尔瓦（Mel Silva）星期五（1月22日）在联邦参议院一场听证会上说，新法“无法执行”。 但澳大利亚总理莫里森（Scott Morrison）称，国会议员不会屈服于任何“威吓”，新法也得到政界广泛支持，联邦政府的目标是在今年内通过新法。 莫里森星期五对媒体记者说：“让我讲清楚：你能在澳大利亚做些什么，规矩由澳大利亚来制定。谁愿意按规矩办事，无任欢迎，但我们不会回应任何威吓。” 一些议员把谷歌方面的说法形容为“勒索”和“大企业欺负民主体制”。 席尔瓦则在听证会上说：“要是这个版本的守则成为法律，我们将别无选择，只能停止在澳大利亚提供谷歌搜索。” 澳大利亚为什么要推行这次立法？ 谷歌搜索是澳大利亚头号搜索引擎，联邦政府形容谷歌几近成为澳大利亚人生活必需的公用事业，但却几乎没有任何市场竞争。政府认为，科企平台在招揽希望阅览新闻内容的顾客前，应首先给媒体机构付出“合理价钱”购买新闻。 澳大利亚政府还认为，新闻业处处受敌，而媒体业是否强大与维系民主体制息息相关，因此需要为新闻业寻求财政支持。政府数据称，自2005年至今，澳大利亚印刷媒体的广告收益下跌75%，近期已有多家媒体机构倒闭或裁员。 谷歌威胁停止提供搜索引擎服务，是迄今反应最强烈的一家。这场应否让媒体机构对互联网企业收费的辩论正受到多国关注。 美国贸易代表办公室本周向澳大利亚联邦参议院递交书面陈述，称新法“对两家美国企业构成明显危害”，促请澳方放弃立法。 谷歌的理据有哪些？ 谷歌透过其浏览器在澳大利亚宣传其立场，试图赢得用户支持。 谷歌澳洲总裁席瓦尔声称，要是新法让他们得为提供网页链接和搜寻结果而付费，那将是“对我们的业务与数字经济立下站不住脚的先例”。她说，这不符合网上信息自由流通，换言之，不符合“互联网如何运转”。 她说：“在相关财政与运营风险下，我们看不出有何办法能继续在澳大利亚提供服务。” 谷歌上周证实对澳洲1%用户屏蔽澳大利亚新闻网站的搜索结果，从而测试澳大利亚新闻服务的价值。 Facebook去年也曾威胁，一旦新法实施，将停止让澳大利亚用户分享新闻内容。Facebook亚太公共政策部副总裁米尔纳（Simon Milner）星期五在同一场参议院听证会上重复此立场，称呼此举为“潜在的最坏结果”。 米尔纳说，Facebook在其平台上放置新闻内容，几乎没有从中赚取任何商业收益。 谷歌与Facebook还争论说，新闻媒体本身已透过网企平台把读者吸引到各自网站去，从中获益。 分析——BBC北美科技事务记者詹姆斯·克莱顿： 这是一个非常罕见的威胁。 谷歌以将近90%的份额占据搜索引擎市场，其收益几乎都是来自广告。于谷歌而言，威胁全面撤出一个国家，意味着其感到忧虑。 澳大利亚谈不上是其最大市场，但谷歌的管理层对这些新法律可能立下的先例感到惧怕。 疫症大流行爆发至今，谷歌获利甚丰，许多地方报纸却在挣扎求存。这并非好事，而澳洲政治家不会是第一批走出来指出这现象的人，也不会是最后一批。 谷歌声称其希望资助原创地方新闻，但它显然相信澳洲正在倡议的立法一旦被其他地方仿效，将根本动摇对其经营模式。
"Michel Barnier said he was ""not in the frame of mind to make concessions or ask for concessions"". UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said talks got off to a ""promising start"". The UK appears to have conceded to the EU's preferred order for the talks which will mean trade negotiations do not begin immediately. Mr Davis and Mr Barnier gave a joint press conference after day one of the talks in Brussels. The initial focus will be on expat rights, a financial settlement and ""other separation issues"". Discussions aimed at preserving the Good Friday Agreement and common travel area in Ireland will also begin, although Mr Davis suggested these issues may not be settled until the end of the process, when the UK's trade relationship with the EU is settled. The UK had wanted talks on its future relationship with the EU to be considered from the outset, but Mr Barnier said this would only happen once the European Council decided ""sufficient progress has been made"" on the other issues. Mr Davis - who had predicted this would be the ""row of the summer"" - denied suggestions the agreed timetable showed Britain's ""weakness"" and insisted it was ""completely consistent"" with the government's aim of parallel trade and exit talks. ""It's not when it starts it's how it finishes that matters,"" he said. Asked whether he had made any concessions to the UK in return, Mr Barnier said the UK had decided to leave the EU - not the other way around, and each side had to ""assume our responsibility and the consequences of our decisions"". ""I am not in a frame of mind to make concessions, or ask for concessions,"" he said. ""It's not about punishment, it is not about revenge. ""Basically, we are implementing the decision taken by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and unravel 43 years of patiently-built relations. ""I will do all I can to put emotion to one side and stick to the facts, the figures, and the legal basis, and work with the United Kingdom to find an agreement in that frame of mind."" Who is in charge? Laura Kuennsberg, BBC political editor It's often compared to a divorce - the UK wanted to talk about who gets the house and the CD collection at the same time as settling who pays for the kids' weddings in 20 years' time. The EU on the other hand have been firm all along that the future arrangements could only be discussed once the terms of the initial split have been agreed. The debate was called ""parallelism versus sequentialism"" and from this afternoon's press conference and the announcement of the procedure it is clear that the UK has lost. Ministers believed they would be able to persuade the EU - the failure to do so has been described as a ""total cave-in"". The discussion was even predicted by Mr Davis as likely to be the ""row of the summer"". The row won't happen because it seems the UK has already given in. Read more from Laura Mr Barnier said a ""fair deal"" was possible ""and far better than no deal"". He promised to work with, not against, the UK. ""We must lift the uncertainty caused by Brexit,"" he said. The two men - who exchanged gifts at the start of the talks - set out the structure for the initial negotiations. There will be one week of negotiations every month. Working groups of ""senior experts"" will be set up to focus on the three main areas. On citizens' rights, which the UK has said should be an immediate priority, Mr Davis said there was ""much common ground"". The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote. Prior to the start of talks, Mr Davis gave his counterpart a first edition of a mountaineering book - a French-language version of Regards vers Annapurna - while Mr Barnier reciprocated with a traditional, hand-carved walking stick from Savoie, complete with leather wrist strap. Who's who in the UK delegation? After holding talks with Theresa May in Downing Street, new Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said there must be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and economic borders must be ""invisible"". While he said he regretted Mrs May's decision to leave the single market and customs union, he said the two had a shared objective to minimise disruption to trade after the UK's exit. Earlier former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose, who chaired the Stronger In campaign last year, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was reassured that economic considerations were ""top of the pile"" but ministers needed to be realistic with the public. Speaking on the same programme, JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin - one of the leading pro-Leave business voices - said negotiators had to be open to possible compromises but also prepared to walk away and to default to World Trade Organization rules if necessary. ""I don't think many people feel that staying in the single market and customs union and being subject to EU laws is Brexit. ""I think Brexit is parliamentary sovereignty and an assertion of democracy. Outside that, I think there is a quite a lot of scope,"" Mr Martin said. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said there was ""real confusion"" about the government's mandate after the general election result.",与英国展开第一轮谈判之后，欧盟首席谈判官表示，英国脱欧将会带来“实实在在”的后果。,"Brexit Secretary David Davis ""determined optimist"" after day one 米歇尔·巴尼耶（Michel Barnier）说，他目前没有打算“让步或者要求对方让步”。 英国脱欧事务大臣大卫·戴维斯（David Davis）表示，谈判已经有了一个“有希望的开始”。 英国似乎已经接受了欧盟所倾向的谈判程序，即贸易谈判不会立即开始。 在布鲁塞尔进行完首日谈判之后，戴维斯和巴尼耶举行了联合记者会。 谈判前期的焦点将是驻外人员权利、一份财政协议以及“其他分离问题”。 以保留《贝尔法斯特协议》（Belfast Agreement）和爱尔兰共同旅游地为目标的谈判也将开始，不过戴维斯表示，这些问题可能要等到整个程序结束，即英国与欧盟的贸易关系尘埃落定时，才会达成共识。 英国曾希望从一开始就同时谈判英国未来与欧盟的关系，但是巴尼耶表示，这只会发生在欧洲理事会（European Council）认为其他问题“已经得到充分进展”的时候。 戴维斯否认目前的时间表显示了英国的“弱点”，他坚称这一时间表与英国政府力求贸易与脱欧谈判并行的目标“完全一致”。 “重要的不是它什么时候开始，而是它如何结束，”他说。 巴尼耶被问到他是否对英国作出了任何相应的让步。他表示，离开欧盟是英国的决定，不是欧盟的决定，而任何一方都必须“为我们作出的决定承担责任和后果”。 “我目前的思维框架当中不打算让步或者要求对方让步，”他说。 “它不是要惩罚，不是要报复。” “基本上，我们是在执行英国的决定，让它离开欧盟、瓦解43年耐心建立的关系。” “在这样的一个大局内，我会尽我所能将情绪放到一边，坚持看事实，看数据和法律基础。并与英国合作，一同达到共识。” 谁说了算？ BBC政治事务编辑劳拉·昆斯伯格（Laura Kuennsberg） 它经常被比作一场离婚——英国想要在谈判房子和唱片收藏归谁的同时，讨论谁将为20年后孩子们的婚礼买单。 另一方面，欧盟一直都很坚持，未来的安排只会在离婚的条件达成一致之后才会开始讨论。 这场争论被称为“并行与先后”之争，而从这个下午的新闻发布会和所宣布的谈判程序来看，很明显，英国输了。 英国官员们曾相信他们有能力说服欧盟——而现在的失败被形容是“全面崩塌”。 戴维斯还曾经形容，这场讨论很可能是“今夏之争”。但从现在情况看，英国似乎已经屈服。 巴尼耶表示，达成一个“公平的协议”是有可能的，并且“比没有协议要好得多”。他承诺，将会与英国合作解决，而不是对抗。 “我们必须解除英国脱欧带来的不确定性，”他说。 英国脱欧大臣戴维斯和欧盟首席谈判官巴尼耶 两名代表在谈判开始时交换了礼物，他们列出了初期谈判的框架，每个月将会有一周进行谈判。 一些“资深专家”将会组成多个小组，集中讨论三个主要领域的问题。 关于英国认为应该属于最迫切议题的公民权利，戴维斯表示，双方有“很多共同立场”。 在去年的脱欧公投之后，英国设定在2019年3月底之前脱离欧洲联盟。 在谈判开始前，戴维斯向巴尼耶赠送了一部关于登山的书——法语版的《向安纳布尔纳峰致意》（Regards vers Annapurna），巴尼耶则回赠了一具来自萨瓦省的传统手工拐杖。"
"In both the photos, taken by his mother the Duchess of Cambridge, the future king flashes a gap-toothed smile at the camera. She photographed her son earlier this month and the pictures are likely to have been taken at their Norfolk home. Kensington Palace said Prince William and Catherine were ""delighted"" to share the photos. In one of the pictures, George is dressed in a dark green polo shirt and in the other he stands side-on, dressed more casually in a T-shirt with a camouflage design. The prince is the great-grandchild of the Queen. He will be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the crown of England in 1066 if, as is expected, he follows on as king from his grandfather, the Prince of Wales, and then his father, the Duke of Cambridge. Prince George was pictured several times during the coronavirus lockdown with his younger siblings, five-year-old Princess Charlotte and two-year-old Prince Louis, as they applauded heath and care workers during the weekly Clap for Carers. Prince George Alexander Louis - known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge - was born on 22 July 2013. He was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in central London and appeared in front of the world's media one day later, when Prince William and Catherine stood cradling him on the hospital steps. Earlier this year, the duke and duchess spoke about home-schooling George and his brother and sister while schools closed to most pupils during lockdown. ""The children have got such stamina I don't know how,"" Catherine told the BBC. ""You pitch a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake. You get to the end of the day and they have had a lovely time - but it is amazing how much you can cram into one day, that's for sure.""",星期二（7月22日）是英国王位第三顺位继承人——乔治小王子——的周岁生日。 王室周一晚上又公布两张小王子萌照，为乔治庆生。,王室公布了两张乔治王子和父母在一起的新照片。 和上周日公布的第一张照片一样，这两张乔治和父母在一起的照片也是几个星期前在伦敦自然历史博物馆的蝴蝶展览上拍摄的。 乔治的父母——威廉王子和凯特王妃——发表声明说：“在乔治的周岁生日，我们想借此机会向这一年来我们在国内外遇到的所有人表示感谢，感谢他们对乔治和我们全家给予的热情而慷慨的祝福。” 威廉和凯特星期二晚些时候将在肯辛顿宫家中为乔治王子举行生日派对。 这三张照片都是由英国报业协会（Press Association）的约翰·斯提尔威尔（John Stillwell）拍摄的。 这些照片都是几周前在伦敦自然历史博物馆拍摄的。 斯提尔威尔在乔治王子出生的第二天，拍下他第一次公开露面的照片。 去年10月，乔治王子受洗，斯提尔威尔也拍了他受洗的照片。 乔治王子去年7月22日出生，他全名是乔治·亚历山大·路易（George Alexander Louis），被尊称为剑桥乔治王子殿下（His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge）。 这张照片是上周日公布的。 （编译：秦川/责编：）
"They entered what is known as the Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ), but did not enter US air space. The planes, two of which were MiG 31 jets, left the area without incident. Officials said this type of incident was not uncommon, and happens up to 10 times a year. The ADIZ is a zone of airspace which extends out approximately 200 miles from the coastline and is mainly within international airspace. US sovereign air space extends 12 nautical miles from land. Two Alaskan-based F-22 fighter jets and two Canadian CF-18 fighter jets were scrambled to intercept the Russian planes in two separate incidents on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning. Also on Wednesday, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said two Russian military aircraft had crossed into Swedish air space south of the Baltic Sea island of Oland. The ministry called it a ""serious violation"". Sweden has said it has summoned the Russian ambassador over the incident.",美国军方证实，两架美国战机星期四（9月18日）拦截了进入阿拉斯加附近美国防空识别区的六架俄罗斯空军军机，加拿大空军周四凌晨也在该国北极海岸附近拦截了两架俄罗斯远程战略轰炸机。,俄罗斯战机进入美国和加拿大防空识别区，美加两国出动战机拦截。 据美国有线电视新闻网（CNN）报道，美军两架F-22战机从阿拉斯加基地起飞，拦截了俄罗斯两架伊尔-78加油机、两架米格-31战机和两架俄制Tu-95远程战略轰炸机。 加拿大广播公司（CBC）新闻网报道，两架加拿大CF-18s战机星期四凌晨在距加拿大北极海岸线75公里处拦截了两架俄制Tu-95远程战略轰炸机。 北美防空联合司令部（NORAD）对美加媒体表示，俄罗斯战机在绕飞一圈之后，返回了俄罗斯。 北美防空联合司令部发言人贝斯·史密斯说，当时，这两架战略轰炸机正沿博福特海上空“加拿大防空识别区”的“西边”飞行。 “加拿大防空识别区”的范围从海岸线向外延伸320公里，远超定义主权国家领空的从海岸线向外延伸22公里（或12海里）的距离。 北美防空联合司令部另一位发言人杰夫·戴维斯对美国媒体说，被拦截的这些俄罗斯战机在距美国阿拉斯加海岸线约55海里处、距加拿大北极海岸线约40海里处飞行。 声明说，尽管俄罗斯战机没有进入美国领空，但它却进入了阿拉斯加西部的“美国防空识别区”和“加拿大防空识别区”。 声明说，美国防空识别区范围从海岸线向外延伸至200海里，主要范围都在国际空域内。美国防空识别区的外沿范围大于美国领空的范围。 美加拦截进入防空识别区的俄罗斯军机。 美国有线电视新闻网引述美国官员说，华盛顿官员认为，有关事件与乌克兰总统波罗申科对美国和加拿大的访问有关。 波罗申科星期三与加拿大官员举行了会谈，并在星期四会晤了美国总统奥巴马。美国承诺向乌克兰提供4600万美元的援助，帮助乌克兰与亲俄武装作战。 加拿大媒体说，在访加期间，波罗申科曾在加拿大国会发表讲话，并感谢加拿大对乌克兰政府打击亲俄武装的支持。 北美防空联合司令部表示，在过去五年里，北美防空联合司令部战机已拦截了50多架俄罗斯飞机，但通常情况下拦截的都是一至两架飞机，一般会是战略轰炸机。 2010年，加拿大战机在纽芬兰拦截了同型号的俄罗斯远程战略轰炸机。加拿大时任国防部长表示，加拿大空军每年都会拦截12至18架俄罗斯轰炸机。 （编译/责编：萧尔） 网友如要发表评论，请使用下表：
"By Emily McAuliffeBusiness reporter, Melbourne, Australia ""The atmosphere is usually one of enthusiasm, excitement, anticipation and curiosity,"" he says. If you asked people to try to picture hunting for truffles, the expensive subterranean fungi, many would no doubt imagine men with dogs going through woodlands in France or Italy. Given that truffles have been harvested in both countries for centuries, this is understandable. Yet since 1999 they have been joined by Australia, which in just 20 years has become the world's fourth-largest producer of the most-prized type of black truffle - the French black or périgord. Some in the Australian industry, such as Mr Wood, the owner of Truffle Paddock, a truffle farm in the state of Victoria, even believe that in another decade's time the country could take the number one position. While exact country-by-country figures are difficult to come by, given the secrecy that surrounds the ""diamonds in the dirt"", Australia is expected to harvest between 14 and 18 tonnes of French blacks this year. This compares with an estimated 60 tonnes last winter in Spain, 30 tonnes in Italy, and slightly more than Australia in France. (Industry experts say it is notoriously difficult to quantify French production figures due to a lack of data, and accusations that it imports périgords from Spain that then become ""French"".) What is not in doubt is that selling fresh French blacks is a very lucrative business. Much in demand in the world's finest restaurants, they can retail for up to $1,300 (£1,000) a kg. Not native to Australia, they were first introduced to the country in the mid 1990s, with the first Australian truffles unearthed in 1999. To cultivate or farm the truffles, trees - typically oak and hazelnut saplings - are replanted after their roots have been inoculated with the fungus' spores. Then five to eight years later you can start to harvest the resulting black truffles. As périgord truffles are harvested in the autumn and winter, the season in Australia runs from May until mid August. Geoff Barrett, co-founder and managing director of Oak Valley Truffles in Western Australia, says this gives the country's producers a huge advantage because they are selling their crop when they are none available from Europe. ""Australia's truffle industry is doing so well because we don't have any competitors,"" he says. ""We produce truffles in the southern hemisphere when there are none in the northern hemisphere."" Given that fresh truffles only have a shelf life of two weeks, it means that thanks to Australia's crop, chefs in the northern hemisphere can now sell dishes including the priced ingredient in their spring and summer. ""We export to 31 countries, and don't have the supply by even half to match the demand from overseas,"" says Alex Wilson, head of sales at The Truffle & Wine Co - Australia's first commercial truffle farm or truffière, and the single largest producer of black truffles in the southern hemisphere. ""We export around 85% of our truffles and I pre-sell the whole crop,"" he says. Truffle & Wine Co is so bullish about the industry's growth that it has ripped up around 80% of its former vineyards in Western Australia to allow expansion of the truffière. While Western Australia, and more specifically, the town of Manjimup, produces the lion's share of Australia's périgord truffles - there are now 300 farms scattered across the country, and this number is expected to grow. Colin Carter, vice president of the Australian Truffle Growers Association, says that his members are well versed on how to produce good crops, such as adding limestone to their soils to reach the desired alkaline levels. Mr Wilson says this knowhow means that the industry in Australia is ""leaps and bounds ahead"" of more recent efforts to farm truffles in South Africa, and countries in South America. ""Australia has a multi-tonne commercial industry, while places such as South Africa are still finding their feet,"" he adds. Alongside Australia's successful exports, a small domestic market is also developing. While truffles have long been a menu staple in Europe, the delicate fungus is a more recent addition to Australia's gastronomy scene, so part of the challenge for local growers has been around education and raising the profile of truffles. ""If you mentioned truffles to someone in Australia 20 years ago, most would have assumed you were talking about a chocolate,"" says Barrett. ""Now I'd say 95% of people know what a truffle is, and many are inquisitive as to how they're grown and used."" Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: French-born chef Philippe Mouchel says he's noticed greater consumer awareness of truffles at his namesake restaurant in Melbourne's central business district. ""During the Australian season we use fresh black truffles across much of our menu and people ask for it,"" he says. ""If you look around Melbourne, everyone is doing truffle degustation dinners throughout winter and they're so popular they sell out. ""There are more and more truffles around, chefs want to work with them and people want to enjoy them."" To help continue to raise this awareness, Mr Wood of Truffle Paddock, helps to organise an annual truffle festival in Melbourne. And back on his truffle farm he has just spent the autumn and winter welcoming visitors to join him and his dogs hunting for the precious crop. ""On most hunts, guests are invited to smell the truffle in the earth before it's harvested, and sometimes get to dig out the truffle,"" he says. ""People really enjoy that part and often want to buy the truffle they harvested to take home, share, and most likely brag about."" Regarding the wider industry in the country, he says: ""There is good reason to think that Australia could become the world's largest producer of black truffles within the decade. ""Some Western Australia estimates suggest that in 10 years their production will quadruple, as many newer and very large and medium-sized farms come into production. And although the east coast is usually characterised by small to medium-sized farms, more recently some large farms have also been established.""",当他的几只狗在土壤下嗅出一株珍贵的黑松露（black truffle）时，伍德先生（Nigel Wood）告诉我们说，对那些在狗身旁的人来说，这也是一个令人激动的时刻。 “那时候的气氛通常是热情、兴奋、期待和好奇，”他说。,"伍德先生与他的松露搜索团队。 如果让人们想象寻找松露（一种昂贵的地下食用真菌）的过程，多数人无疑会想象一位牵着狗的人，正经过法国或意大利的林地。因为，几个世纪以来，这两个国家已经成为发现黑松露的主要地方。 然而，自从1999年以来，在短短20年间，澳大利亚已成为世界上第四大最珍贵的黑松露（French Black），或称佩里戈尔松露（périgord）的生产国。从事黑松露买卖的人士，例如维多利亚州松露园（Truffle Paddock）的伍德先生，甚至相信在未来十年，澳大利亚可能成为首屈一指的松露生产国。 松露：泥土里的钻石。 黑松露被称为“泥土下的钻石”。虽然围绕黑松露有许多秘密，确切的国家或地区的黑松露生产数据很难得到，但澳大利亚预计今年将收获14至18公吨的黑松露。 相比之下，西班牙去年冬天估计为60公吨，意大利为30公吨，以及略高于澳大利亚的法国。业内专家表示，由于缺乏数据，法国黑松露的生产数据难以量化，并批评法国从西班牙进口黑松露，让后者随即变成了“法国”特有生产的佩里戈尔品种的黑松露。 总之，出售新鲜的法国黑松露毫无疑问是个利润颇丰的生意。世界上最好的餐厅对这款黑松露的需求量很大，每公斤的零售价可高达1,300美元（约1,000英镑）。 实际上，这款黑松露不是来自澳大利亚本土，它们是在20世纪90年代中期首次引入该国，并在1999年挖出了第一批澳大利亚松露。 为培育或种植松露，通常是在橡树和榛子树的根部接种松露的真菌孢子，再重新培育树木。之后5到8年后，便可以开始采收在树木根部养育而成的松露。 西澳大利亚“橡树谷松露”（Oak Valley Truffles）创始人和董事总经理巴瑞特（Geoff Barrett）先生说，由于佩里戈尔黑松露品种是在秋冬两季收成，相当于是澳大利亚的5月到8月中旬之间。因此，现在澳大利亚的松露商人有很大优势，因为当欧洲没有松露时，澳大利亚便能出售他们的产品。 巴瑞特强调，“澳大利亚的松露产业做得很好，因为我们没有任何竞争对手。当北半球没有松露时，我们就在南半球生产。” 黑松露是在秋冬两季收成。 鉴于新鲜松露的保存期只有两周，这便意味着北半球的餐厅，现在可以在春夏两季，兜售来自南半球澳大利亚的松露菜肴。 澳大利亚第一个商业松露农场，也是南半球最大的黑松露生产商——“松露与酒”公司销售主管威尔逊（Alex Wilson）称：“我们的松露出口到31个国家，但供应还是没法满足海外的需求，甚至连一半都没有。” 他补充说：“我们出口了大约85％的松露，而且全部都是预售出去的。” périgord 松露十分昂贵。 “松露与酒”公司对松露产业的增长十分乐观，该公司也已经改造了西澳大利亚约80％的前葡萄园成为培育松露的园地，以扩大松露产量。 西澳大利亚州，尤其是曼吉麻普镇占据了澳大利亚佩里戈尔黑松露生产的大部分份额。不过，现在全澳也有300家松露农场，预计生产量还会增长。 澳大利亚“松露培育者协会”副主席卡特（Colin Carter）说，他们的会员精通如何生产优质的松露，例如在土壤中添加石灰石以达到种植松露所需的土壤碱性水平。 世界上最好的餐厅对这款黑松露的需求量很大。 威尔逊先生解释，这种专业知识意味着澳大利亚的松露产业突飞猛进，比起最近在南非以及南美洲等国家种植松露超前许多，“澳大利亚已经有高产量的松露贸易，但像南非仍然才刚开始。” 除了成功出口外，澳大利亚国内的松露小市场也正在发展中。虽然松露长期以来一直在欧洲的菜单上，但这种奇特的真菌，现在是澳大利亚美食界的新成员。因此，对当地种植者来说，现在的挑战之一是如何教育公众和提高松露的形象。 巴瑞特表示，“如果在20年前向澳大利亚人提到松露，多数人会认为，你说的是某种巧克力”； “但现在95％的澳大利亚人都知道松露是什么。而且很多人对于松露如何培育以及食用都很感兴趣”。 法国出生的厨师菲利普·穆谢尔（Philippe Mouchel）表示，他注意到墨尔本中央商务区同名餐厅对松露的消费意识增强。穆谢尔说，在松露收获进入澳大利亚季节的时候，“我们在大部分的菜单上都使用新鲜的黑松露，人们也会要求有松露。” “在墨尔本，整个冬天人们都在做可品尝松露的晚餐，松露很受欢迎，马上卖光了；”他还说：“周围的松露越来越多，厨师希望菜肴中有松露，食客也希望品尝松露。” 为了继续帮助公众提高这种意识，维多利亚州松露农场的伍德在墨尔本组织了一年一度的松露节。在松露农场的秋冬季节，伍德都在欢迎游客和他的狗一起寻找珍贵的黑松露。 世界上最好的餐厅都对这款黑松露的需求量很大。 “在寻找过程中，游客可在收获松露之前先在泥地上闻一闻它们，有时可以参与挖出松露的活动。”他说，“人们非常喜欢这一活动，并且经常想把挖出的松露买下并带回家，与人分享，并顺便向人吹嘘这一段经历。” 伍德说：“有充分理由认为，澳大利亚可能在十年内成为世界上最大的黑松露生产国。” “西澳大利亚州的一些估计数字显示，10年后，随着许多新农场和大中型农场投入生产，黑松露的产量将翻两番。虽然东海岸通常是一些中小型的黑松露农场，但最近也建成了一些大型农场。”"
"Although the official result has not yet been declared, main rival Mar Roxas admitted defeat after polls gave Mr Duterte an unassailable lead. Mr Duterte said he accepted the mandate with ""extreme humility"". The 71-year-old stirred controversy during campaigning with his incendiary comments. He has credited his success to his tough stance on law and order. His record as the crime-crushing mayor of the southern town of Davao, once notorious for its lawlessness, earned him the moniker The Punisher and resonated with voters. ""Duterte Harry"" in quotes The Philippines elects its first transgender politician Populism, celebrity and ugly realities in the Philippines Who were the candidates in the Philippines' elections? Other driving issues of the election campaign were pervasive corruption, as well as the poverty and inequality experienced by many Filipinos despite economic growth under outgoing President Benigno ""Noynoy"" Aquino. What next for Duterte: Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC News, Manila Rodrigo Duterte, a man dubbed by his rivals as an executioner who would bring terror to the Philippines, has won the presidency by a clear margin, polling nearly twice as many votes as his nearest rivals. But what is less clear is what he will do with the job. His blunt promise to sweep away criminals and corrupt officials won him the backing of millions of Filipinos weary of ineffective governments. But he has so far offered few policy details. A spokesman has already pledged a radical overhaul of the political system. Human rights groups have warned he may repeat what happened in the southern city of Davao, where as mayor he is accused of allowing death squads to murder hundreds of alleged criminals. Mr Duterte has a formidable task in a country still hampered by poverty and poor infrastructure - just meeting the lofty expectations he raised during his campaign will be hard enough. Election officials have said there was a record turnout at polling stations, with more than 81% of the 54 million registered voters casting a ballot. Senators and about 18,000 local officials including mayors are also being elected. The PPCRV (Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting) poll monitor said that with 90% of the presidential ballots counted, Mr Duterte had more than 14.8m votes - about 39%. The PPCRV is accredited by the election commission to monitor counting but its reporting does not represent an official tally. Mr Roxas, a former interior minister and Mr Duterte's closest rival, had 8.6 million votes. As the extent of his lead became clear, Mr Duterte told AFP news agency: ""It's with humility, extreme humility, that I accept this, the mandate of the people."" Mr Roxas accepted his rival's win. ""There are many tears in the room. Let me tell you this is not a time for tears. For our country, we have had a peaceful, successful transfer of power."" Another key rival, Senator Grace Poe, was the first to concede defeat, promising to ""co-operate with the healing process"" after a turbulent campaign. In the election to be vice-president, Leni Robredo, a social activist, is currently slightly ahead of Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos, the son of a former dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The appeal of Duterte: Analysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent The statistics are stark, and bleak. Experts say anywhere between 40% and 80% of Philippine legislators are connected to political dynasties with vested interests. A handful of the families control almost all of the country's wealth. And perhaps the bleakest statistic of all: 25% of the population lives under the poverty line - a figure that has not changed much in two decades. So it shouldn't come as a surprise then that Filipinos have chosen Mr Duterte's crime-busting, tough-talking, action-oriented ways over the current administration's candidate Manuel Roxas. More on this from Karishma Mr Aquino is standing down as the constitution limits presidents to one six-year term. As Mr Duterte rose in opinion polls ahead of voting, Mr Aquino had tried to unite other candidates against him, warning his election could mean a return to dictatorship for the Philippines. Mr Duterte has made many controversial statements during his campaign, saying that he would massacre criminals and drug-users, joking about the rape of an Australian missionary and saying he would dissolve congress if it didn't agree with him. He has also given forthright opinions on the Philippines' territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea, saying he would sail to disputed islands and plant the Philippine flag there. The Philippines has taken one of its claims to a court of arbitration at the Hague. On Monday, he said he would seek multilateral talks over the issue, to include the US and Japan. Duterte: From 'Punisher' to president",在主要竞争者宣布失败后，有菲律宾版“特朗普“之称的罗德里戈·杜特蒂（Rodrigo Duterte）已经赢得2016年的菲律宾总统大选。,杜特蒂以几乎两倍于主要竞争对手的选票赢得菲律宾大选。 尽管官方还没有公布最终投票结果，但杜特蒂的主要竞争对手罗哈斯（Mar Roxas）已承认失败并宣布退出。 杜特蒂表示，他将怀着“极度谦虚的心态”接受这一任命。 在菲律宾政坛，71岁的杜特蒂以“强硬派”著称，竞选期间“直言不讳”地抛出过多种引发争议的言论。他认为自己在政坛的成功源于在法治和社会秩序上持有的强硬立场。 在外交问题上，他曾表示要亲自登上南中国海的争议岛屿并插上菲律宾国旗。 在内政问题上，杜特蒂曾称要大规模处死吸毒者和其他罪犯。他曾在菲律宾南部的达沃市担任市长，并在这个曾经法治松懈的区域采取强硬的打击犯罪的行动，为自己赢得了“惩罚者”的绰号，并赢得了选民支持。 杜特蒂赢得大选的另一因素是，现任总统阿基诺三世任职期间，尽管经济增长率较高，但出现了大规模政府官员腐败以及贫困、贫富差距扩大等问题，菲律宾民众对此深恶痛绝。 分析：BBC记者赫德（Jonathan Head）发自马尼拉 杜特蒂以几乎两倍于主要竞争对手的选票赢得菲律宾大选。竞选对手称他为“屠夫”，并说他将给这个国家带来恐怖。 但截至目前，杜特蒂将如何执政尚不明了。唯一清楚的是他承诺将尽力打击犯罪行为和腐败官员，这也是他获得民众支持的重要原因。 但他还缺乏执行这些政策的具体细节。他的发言人表态说将对现有政治体系进行彻底检修。但人权团体担心曾经发生在达沃市的一幕会在全国范围内上演。在担任达沃市长期间，杜特蒂曾被指责允许对数量众多的所谓罪犯执行死刑。 杜特蒂还在消除贫困、改善落后的基础设施方面面临极大挑战。 在选情已经逐渐明晰之后，杜特蒂告诉法新社记者，“我会以极度谦虚的心态来接受总统任命。” 现任菲律宾内政部长、杜特蒂的主要竞争对手之一罗哈斯（Mar Roxas）表态接受杜特蒂的胜利，“对国家来说，这是一次和平的、成功的权力交接。” 另一位竞争对手、稍早前宣布退出选举参议员格蕾西·波（Grace Poe）也承诺将在动荡的选举之后“采取合作支持恢复运转”。 人物：杜特蒂—从“惩罚者”到总统 （编译：川江 责编：萧尔）
"The latest figures show there were 70,000 people out of work between December 2017 and February 2018, which is 3,000 fewer than the previous quarter, and 4,000 fewer than a year earlier. The Welsh unemployment rate fell by 0.3 percentage point over the past year. The UK rate fell 0.1 percentage point from the previous quarter to 4.2%. Figures released last month put the Welsh unemployment rate at 4.8%. The employment rate for people aged 16-64 was down 0.1 percentage point at 73% compared with 12 months ago. The rate of economic inactivity increased slightly over the year by 0.3 percentage point to 23.4%. This looks at the number of people between 16 and 64 not actively looking for work because they are full-time students, carers, early retirees or long-term sick and they are not counted in the unemployment rate. Wales' unemployment rate is lower than London, Yorkshire/Humberside, West Midlands and north-east England, according to the information published by the Office for National Statistics. The unemployment rate in both south-east England and south-west England was 3.4%. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: ""While there is still a lot of work to do, I am confident we will build on this encouraging picture as employers continue to seek out our skilled workforce and great venues for investment"".",英国就业市场状况继续改善，今年2-4月失业率降到6.6%，但工资上涨速度减缓。,英国目前有110万人领取求职者补贴。 周三（6月11日）公布的统计数据显示，英国失业人数减少了16.1万，失业总人数跌至216万。 就业人数增加了34.5万，绝大部分是全职工作，使就业总人数增至3005万。 但这三个月的工资涨幅（扣除奖金因素）从1.9%减到0.9%。 英国国家统计局（ONS）说，失业人数跌至五年多来最低点，但青年（16-24岁）失业人数仍停留在85.3万。 英国首相卡梅伦在推特上表示，这是联合政府长期经济规划中的一个里程碑，从2010年起私营企业新增200万工作。 但工党影子大臣利夫斯（Rachel Reeves）指出，工资涨幅缩小表明即使有工作，人们也仍在为生计挣扎。 分析人士认为，最新统计显示新增就业大部分是全职工作，而不是自雇，说明就业形势确实在好转。 不过，统计局的数据对英国央行利率委员会来说却传递了喜忧交织的信息。 就业市场表现强劲，为呼吁央行尽早提息提供了新的论据，但工资涨幅低于预期的1.2%，却令人担忧。 有观点预计英格兰银行可能会继续维持现有利率，直到明年2季度，主要原因就是工资涨幅令人失望。 英国通胀率目前是1.8%，说明工资上涨速度不及物价涨速，“生活成本危机”仍是英国经济复苏的薄弱环节。 有分析人士认为，今后几个月工资上涨将明显提速。 （编译：郱书 / 责编：路西）
"In a statement, the Taliban acknowledged Mansour's death for the first time and named his successor as Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada. Analysts say it is unlikely the group will change direction under hardline religious scholar Akhundzada. Meanwhile, a breakaway faction has rejected the move, saying Akhundzada does not represent the group. This highlights deep divisions in the Taliban following the death of the group's founder Mullah Mohammad Omar and his replacement by Mansour. Mansour was killed in a strike on his car in Pakistan's Balochistan province on Saturday. Under his stewardship, the Taliban refused to take part in peace talks. Instead, militant attacks escalated and became more daring. Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, a former head of the Taliban courts, was a deputy leader to Mansour. Profile: New Taliban chief Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada Appointment signals continuity The trail of clues after Taliban leader's death Analysis: Waheed Massoud, editor, BBC Afghan service, Kabul It doesn't look as if there will be a major shift in the Taliban's approach to peace talks under the new leadership. Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada was deputy to Mullah Mansour and held senior positions under the movement's founder Mullah Omar. He comes from Kandahar in the Taliban heartlands of southern Afghanistan and seems to have been an acceptable choice for a significant number of Taliban shura (council) members. The new leader is not as controversial as his predecessor, who led the militants for two years before news emerged that Mullah Omar was actually dead. A Taliban statement said the new appointment had been unanimous, the same word the Taliban used when Mullah Mansour took over. Splits soon emerged after that - this time there could still be some disagreements, but probably not enough to challenge the new leader's authority. ""Hibatullah Akhundzada has been appointed as the new leader of the Islamic Emirate (Taliban) after a unanimous agreement in the shura (supreme council), and all the members of shura pledged allegiance to him,"" the Taliban said in a statement. It also said that Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, son of Mullah Omar, would become a joint deputy head of the movement, alongside current deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani. Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is much more well known, is leader of the Haqqani network which has been blamed for some of the most violent attacks inside Afghanistan. The group is known for its daring raids on Western and Afghan targets, particularly in Kabul. Mansour named Akhundzada as his successor in his will, Taliban sources told AFP, in what may be an attempt to legitimise the transition. A spokesman for Afghanistan's chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, urged the new Taliban leader to join talks. ""We invite Mula Hibatullah to peace. Political settlement is the only option for the Taliban or new leadership will face the fate of Mansour,"" Javid Faisal tweeted. In 2015 the Taliban was deeply divided over the selection of Mullah Mansour as the new leader. The fact that Akhundzada comes from the traditional Taliban stronghold of Kandahar is likely to please rank-and-file fighters, the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Kabul says. But there is already controversy surrounding his appointment, with a splinter faction led by Mullah Mohammad Rasool saying it will reject the group's new leadership. ""I believe this appointment is done by outsiders. This does not represent the Taliban movement,"" the faction's deputy head and spokesman, Mullah Abdul Manan Niazi, told the BBC. ""We call them a group for the benefit of foreigners. They cannot represent Afghans and the Taliban. And we are standing against them."" Separately on Wednesday, 11 people were killed and many others were injured in a suicide attack that hit a bus carrying court employees in Kabul. The Taliban said it was behind the attack. What we know about Hibatullah Akhundzada",阿富汗塔利班领袖曼苏尔（Akhtar Mansour）早前在美国空袭中丧生，周三阿富汗塔利班宣布曼苏尔接班人的人选。,阿富汗塔利班领袖曼苏尔早前在美国空袭中丧生，周三阿富汗塔利班宣布阿洪德扎达成为阿富汗塔利班最高领袖 在声明中，塔利班首次确认曼苏尔之死，及指明他的接班人为阿洪德扎达（Mawlawi Haibatullah Akhundzada）。 阿洪德扎达的未来方向不为人知，但分析员指出他成为塔利班领袖并无引起争议。 去年曼苏尔顶替2013年身亡的奥玛尔（Mullah Mohammad Omar）成为最高领袖后，塔利班组织陷入一片混乱。 美军周六发动空袭，在车中的曼苏尔被杀。美国及阿富汗政府说他是塔利班及阿富汗官员达成和议的障碍。在他的领导下，塔利班的攻势更凌厉及大胆。 阿洪德扎达是一名宗教学者及塔利班法庭的领袖。他曾是阿富汗塔利班的副手。 阿洪德扎达：我们知道些甚么？ 塔利班的声明指：“经过舒拉会议一致通过后，阿洪德扎达被委任成为塔利比的新领袖。所以舒拉成员都会向他效忠。” 声明亦指，奥玛尔的儿子雅各布（Mohammad Yaqoob）将会成为其中一名副领袖。哈卡尼（Sirajuddin Haqqani）现时是另一位副领袖。 哈卡尼比较知名，是哈卡尼网络的领袖。哈卡尼网络曾发动阿富汗最激烈的攻击行动，尤其是在首都喀布尔的攻击为名。 2015年，曼苏尔成为新领袖，令塔利班陷入分裂。 不过，BBC记者桑约·马居姆德（Sanjoy Majumder）说，阿洪德扎达被委以重任没有引起争议。他来自塔利班根据地坎大哈，将令塔利比的战士感到高兴。 另外，政府官员对BBC说，周三发生一辆载有法庭人员的公车遭受自杀式袭击，导致10人杀亡及4人受伤。
"Latest figures show net migration rose to 176,000 - up from 153,000 people in the year to September 2012. The increase appears to buck the trend of a decline in net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to and leaving the country. Prime Minister David Cameron wants to get UK net migration below 100,000 before the next election in 2015. The increase was driven by a change in the number of people who left Britain. In the year to September 2012, 342,000 moved abroad. But fewer people left the UK in the year to December 2012. Over the same period, the number of immigrants arriving in the country remained virtually unchanged. The difference between these two factors meant that net migration rose - although it did not climb back above the level it was at in December 2011. 'Out of options' Immigration minister Mark Harper said net migration was however down by a third since its peak in 2010. He added that a new immigration bill coming into force in the autumn would make it more difficult for people to come into Britain if they had no right to do so and would make it easier to remove people who were not entitled to stay in the country. ""We are committed to bringing net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands,"" Mr Harper said. ""We are working across government to protect public services and ensure our welfare system is not open to abuse."" Shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said the figures were ""a blow"" to the home secretary. ""Theresa May's focus on net migration, which has gone wrong in these figures, has also meant the government is failing badly on illegal immigration, which is a major concern to the public and is getting worse and worse with fewer people being stopped at the border, absconsions up and deportations down. ""Immigration needs to be controlled, but we must recognise there is immigration that works for Britain and immigration that doesn't."" But the pressure group Migrationwatch UK said that the detail of the latest figures showed the government was succeeding in cutting immigration from outside the EU - and that further reductions in net migration could come by ensuring that people leave when they should. Sir Andrew Green, Migrationwatch's chairman, said: ""It is far too early on the basis of one quarter's figures to call this a setback to the government's policy. Student interviews and measures to ensure that students leave when they should will make a substantial difference."" Sarah Mulley, of the centre-left think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the statistics suggested the government was running out of options to meet its target. ""Recent declines have been driven in large part by falling numbers of international students, which has come at a high economic cost, but this trend now appears to be levelling off,"" she said. Other figures released in the report include:",据英国政府公布的最新数字，截至2012年底，英国净移民人数有所增加。,净移民人数是指从英国移民到外国与从外国移民到英国的人数之间的差距。 净移民人数是指从英国移民到外国与从外国移民到英国的人数之间的差距。 最新数字显示，净移民人数截至到2012年9月从15.3万增加到17.6万。 这个数字的增加似乎扭转了英国净移民人数不断下降的趋势。 英国首相卡梅伦希望把英国净移民人数在2015年大选前限制在10万。 净移民人数增加是因为离开英国到外国移民的人数有所下降，在截至到2012年底的一年中，这个数字从35.1万下降到32.1万。 数据显示，在同一时期，进入英国的移民人数从56.6万下降到49.7万。 BBC英国国内事务记者说，净移民人数增加的原因比较复杂，部分原因是离开英国到其他国家移民的人数比政府预期的要低。 如果离开英国的人越来越少，即便进入英国的移民人数减少，英国的净移民人数仍然会增加。 （编译：董乐 责编：尚清）
"Italians have nicknamed him ""Forrest Gump"" on social media, after the slow-witted hero of a 1994 movie, played by Tom Hanks, who runs thousands of miles across the United States. Police stopped the Italian's epic walk at 2am in Fano on the Adriatic coast, a week after he left Como in the north. The man, 48, got a €400 (£362; $485) police fine for breaching the curfew. The story was first reported by the Bologna-based newspaper Il Resto del Carlino but quickly went viral in Italian media. Some comments on social media presented the man as heroic and criticised the fine. One said he should have been rewarded - not fined - and given a new pair of shoes. Another praised him for walking off to cool his anger, rather than resorting to violence. The man told police ""I came here on foot, I didn't use any transport"". He said ""along the way I met people who offered me food and drink"". ""I'm OK, just a bit tired,"" he said, having averaged 60km daily. Police found him wandering aimlessly and cold at night on a coastal highway. After checking his ID in their database they found that his wife had reported him missing, so they contacted her and she travelled to Fano to collect him. The Italian reports did not say how she reacted upon learning that he had picked up a €400 fine.

"In both the photos, taken by his mother the Duchess of Cambridge, the future king flashes a gap-toothed smile at the camera.

In one of the pictures, George is dressed in a dark green polo shirt and in the other he stands side-on, dressed more casually in a T-shirt with a camouflage design. The prince is the great-grandchild of the Queen.

"President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said the suspension included operations to stop people-smuggling, joint military exercises and intelligence exchange. The move came after Jakarta recalled its ambassador from Canberra on Monday. Reports of the spying allegations came out in Australian media from documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden. The leaked document showed that Australian spy agencies named Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the first lady, the vice-president and other senior ministers as targets for telephone monitoring, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Guardian said. The alleged spying took place in 2009, under the previous government. Australia and Indonesia are key allies and trading partners. ""It is not possible that we can continue our co-operation when we are still uncertain that there is no spying towards us,"" Mr Yudhoyono said. He added he would also write to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to seek an official explanation over spying allegations. The decision came after Mr Yudhoyono met with top officials, including the recalled Indonesian ambassador to Australia, to discuss the country's relationship with one of its closest neighbours, reports say. ""We're not only reviewing our co-operation with Australia, we're actually already implementing the downgrading of our bilateral relations with Australia,"" Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa also said on Wednesday. He added that Australia ""must take concrete steps"" to ""repair the almost irreparable damage "". He added that the relationship between both countries was ""not business as usual"". Strained relations Mr Yudhoyono said on Tuesday that ties with Australia had been ""damaged"" over what he said was ""hurtful action"". Mr Abbot reiterated on Wednesday he regretted the embarrassment the media reports have caused. However, he has also previously said he does not believe Australia ""should be expected to apologise for reasonable intelligence-gathering operations"". The document based on a presentation from the Defence Signals Directorate - now known as the Australian Signals Directorate - showed that agencies attempted to listen to Mr Yudhoyono's calls at least once. They also tracked calls made to and from his mobile phone in August 2009. The row is the latest in a series of spying allegations that have strained relations between the two allies, whose relationship include co-operation on asylum-seekers and anti-terrorism, among issues. Earlier this month, Indonesia also expressed anger over reports that Australia's Jakarta embassy was used as part of a US-led spying network in Asia.",澳大利亚监听印尼官员的事件曝光后，印尼宣布停止与澳大利亚的军事合作。,印尼总统尤多约诺宣布停止与澳大利亚的军事合作 印尼总统尤多约诺表示，双方军事合作包括联合打击偷渡、联合军事演习和情报交换。 尤多约诺表示，由于印尼无法断定澳大利亚是否继续对印尼进行情报工作，印尼无法与澳大利亚继续合作。 他还表示，将致函给澳大利亚总理阿博特，要求澳大利亚就窃听指称做出官方解释。 召回大使 此前，印尼在本周一（11月18日）召回驻堪培拉大使，表达对澳大利亚政府秘密监听行为的不满。 澳大利亚政府对印尼官员秘密监听的报道，是澳大利亚媒体根据美国告密者斯诺登泄露的文件而报道出来的。 澳大利亚广播公司报道，斯诺登泄露的文件显示，澳大利亚情报机构秘密监听印尼总统尤多约诺及其夫人，以及副总统和其他高级官员。 据报澳大利亚情报部门进行的监听行动发生在2009年前任政府的任内。 澳大利亚和印尼是盟友关系，两国也是贸易伙伴。 （编译：陈书敏 责编：董乐）
"Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The employees are demanding several key changes in how sexual misconduct allegations are dealt with at the firm, including a call to end forced arbitration - a move which would make it possible for victims to sue. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has told staff he supports their right to take the action. ""I understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel,"" he said in an all-staff email. ""I feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society… and, yes, here at Google, too."" A Twitter feed titled @googlewalkout documented the movement at Google's international offices. Google staff in Singapore, Zurich, London, Tokyo, Berlin and New York were among those to take part. Web developer Sam Dutton, who joined the walkout in London, told the BBC: ""We're walking out to support colleagues in any workplace that have suffered harassment and to ensure that perpetrators aren't protected or rewarded."" What led to the walkout? Anger has boiled over in the past week since the New York Times alleged that one high-profile executive received a $90m (£69m) payout after he left the firm, despite what Google considered a “credible” allegation of sexual misconduct. Andy Rubin, known as the “creator” of the Android mobile operating system, denies the accusation. On Tuesday, another executive - this time from the company’s X research lab - also resigned. Richard DeVaul was said to have made unwanted advances towards a woman who was recently interviewed for a job in which she would have reported to him. Mr DeVaul has not commented since his resignation, but has in the past called the incident an ""error of judgement"". At least 48 other employees were sacked for sexual harassment without receiving a payout, Mr Pichai told staff. He admitted the New York Times’ report had been ""difficult to read"". What do the employees want? Staff involved in Thursday's walkout left notes on their desks telling colleagues: ""I’m not at my desk because I’m walking out with other Googlers and contractors to protest sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency, and a workplace culture that’s not working for everyone."" They have also made formal demands to Google’s management. They are: What is forced arbitration? Forced arbitration, a common contract clause for Silicon Valley workers, demands any disputes are dealt with internally rather than through other methods such as the courts. Critics of forced arbitration say it is used to not only protect the reputations of both the company and the accused, but also to silence victims who are unable to appeal against decisions or take further action. ""Employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,” said Mr Pichai in a statement on Wednesday evening. ""We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action."" What else are Google employees angry about? Co-ordinated action of this scale is unprecedented at a Silicon Valley company, but follows a trend for increasingly impassioned employee activism. ""Women are fed up, and I don't think it's just women,” said Prof Kellie McElhaney, from the Haas School of Business. ""There are a lot of ‘manbassadors' out there who are equally as fed up and using their positions of power and voice, which can cost Google money. I think you have to hit these companies where it hurts. ""I think it empowers other Google offices when women and men are watching this happen, that they can do a similar action that's not just sitting by or making comments to one another or sharing emails."" In the past year, Google employees have spoken out strongly against the company’s work with the US Department of Defense, as well as plans to re-enter the Chinese market with a search product. The Tech Workers Coalition, a San Francisco-based advocacy group, said the dispute over the treatment of women was just one of several that tech companies need to address. “We stand in solidarity with the Google workers,” a spokesperson for the group said. “It’s clear the executives won’t do this for us so we’re taking matters into our own hands.""",谷歌员工全球串联在世界各地办公室展开一系列的“集体出走”活动，抗议该公司对女性的不当对待。,谷歌各地员工在当地时间11点“集体出走”抗议，新加坡办公室是全球出走抗议的第一站 谷歌员工要求公司改变对职场性骚扰的处理方式，包括废除工作合约中的“强制仲裁”条款。废除该条款后受害者将可以向法庭提出诉讼。 谷歌首席执行长桑德尔·皮蔡（Sundar Pichai）表示，他支持员工采取行动的权利。 他在一封发给所有员工的电邮中说，“我理解你们当中许多人感觉的愤怒和失望，我也感觉到了，而且我完全支持我们必须在这个存在已久的问题上取得进展。” 谷歌伦敦办公室的员工参加“出走”抗议活动 为什么要“出走”？ 过去一周里，谷歌员工因为一件事情非常愤怒，《纽约时报》报道指谷歌支付一名高管9000万美元的高额分手费，即使这名高管面临非常“可信”的性骚扰指控。人称“Android之父”的安迪·鲁宾（Andy Rubin）否认所有指控。 在那之后，负责谷歌“X研究室”的高管理查德·德沃尔（Richard DeVaul）也辞职，据报他性骚扰一名到谷歌求职面试的女性，而那名女性面试的是德沃尔底下的职位。 德沃尔辞职后尚未发表任何声明，但过去他曾经说那起事件是一次“判断错误”。 谷歌执行长皮蔡对员工表示，至少有48名谷歌员工因为涉及性骚扰而被解雇，而且没有任何离职金。 参加活动的人在办公桌上放上这张宣传单，表示自己参加“出走罢工”抗议活动 员工要求什么？ 参加谷歌“出走罢工”活动的员工在办公桌上留下字条：“我不在位子上，因为我和其他谷歌人和约聘人员出走抗议性骚扰，不当行为，缺乏透明度，和不是每个人都能接受的职场文化。” 他们还向谷歌管理层提出正式要求，包括： 强制仲裁是什么？ 强制仲裁是美国硅谷员工工作合约中经常见到的一个条款，要求任何争议问题必须内部解决，不能用其他途径，例如告上法院。 反对者批评说，强制仲裁条款保护的是公司和被告者的声誉，而且还强迫受害者噤声，受害者也没有办法对仲裁决定提起申诉或采取后续行动。 皮蔡表示，“对于我们如何改善公司政策，让公司继续向前行进，员工已经提出了建设性的构想。” “我们会听取所有的回馈意见，才能将这些构想化为行动。” 还有什么不满？ 美国硅谷的公司过去从未发生过类似这种大规模经过计划协调的集体行动，但是近年来员工发起情绪激昂的活动则是越来越多。 去年，谷歌员工对该公司和美国国防部的合作计划表达强烈不满，他们也反对谷歌搜索产品重新进入中国市场的计划。
"The package arrived safely at its destination in Cambridge, 13 minutes after being ordered. A video showing the process details how the order was completed using an electrically powered drone flying at up to 400ft (122m). One sceptic questioned how much of a ""game changer"" the limited trial of the service would be. As part of the testing for the Amazon Air service, the delivery took place on 7 December, although it was only revealed on 14 December. The Cambridge fulfilment centre is home to the drones, which, once the ordered package is on board, travel along an automated track to the launch area. The drones then take off and fly completely autonomously, guided by GPS to their destination. They are capable of carrying items weighing up to 2.7kg (5lbs). Need for speed The aim is that all orders made using Amazon Air will be delivered within 30 minutes. The trial will be expanded to dozens of customers living close to the warehouse in the coming months. The safety of drones has come under the spotlight in recent months. There have been reports of near-misses this year between drones and aircraft at London Stansted and Cornwall Airport Newquay. ""Safety is our top priority,"" Amazon said on its website. ""We are currently permitted to operate during daylight hours when there are low winds and good visibility, but not in rain, snow or icy conditions."" There are Prime Air development centres in the US, UK, Austria and Israel. The company is also testing its drone vehicles in ""multiple international locations"". Retail shifts ""This is a marketing coup for Amazon,"" said Natalie Berg, an analyst at Planet Retail. ""The real significance here is the impact it has on shopper expectations. ""Last year, same-day delivery was considered impressive; now it's all about 13 minute lead times. ""Over the past few years, we've seen a proliferation in delivery options as retailers scramble to cater to changing shopping habits. ""Fulfilment has become a firm battleground in retail and the most successful retailers today are those who can deliver products to shoppers in the quickest, most convenient and economical way. ""Drone delivery is another string to Amazon's bow, but it's certainly not an industry game changer.""",网络零销商亚马逊首次在英国完成一项无人机送货服务。,在顾客完成定购13分钟后，无人机把邮包安全投递到位于剑桥的目的地。 一段视频显示了从完成订货到一架飞行高度为122米的电动无人机完成送货的整个过程。 这项“亚马逊空中服务”试验是在12月7日进行的，亚马逊公司在星期三（12月14日）公布的这次服务试验。 但是，有人对这项试验服务的实际意义究竟有多大表示怀疑。 在实验中，无人机从剑桥的任务执行中心出发。 当投递包裹装上无人机之后，无人机沿一条自动轨道前往起飞区域。 随后，无人机起飞，在卫星导航仪指引下完全自动地飞往投递目标。 无人机的最大运载能力为2.7公斤。 亚马逊的目标是，所有通过“亚马逊空中服务”订购的货物都要在30分钟内送达。 亚马逊计划在未来几个月再对居住在货物存放点附近的数十名顾客进行类似实验。 但是，无人机安全问题最近引起关注。 有报告说，在伦敦斯坦斯特德机场和英格兰康沃尔机场今年都曾发生过无人机和飞机近距离相遇的事件。 亚马逊发表声明说，安全是最重要的，“我们目前只允许在白天进行这项操作，而且要求微风和高能见度的条件，不能在雨雪冰条件下进行。”
"The decision had been based not on an examination of Hamas' actions, but on ""factual imputations derived from the press and the internet"", judges found. The court said the move was technical and was not a reassessment of Hamas' classification as a terrorist group. It said a funding freeze on the group would continue for the time being. Hamas dominates Gaza and fought a 50-day war with Israel earlier this year. Under its charter, the movement is committed to Israel's destruction. Responding to the ruling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was a ""murderous terrorist organisation"" which should be put back on the list immediately. Israel, the United States and several other nations have designated Hamas a terrorist organisation due to its long record of attacks and its refusal to renounce violence. Hamas, which was founded in 1987, won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 and reinforced its power in Gaza the following year after ousting its Fatah rivals. Its supporters see it as a legitimate resistance movement against Israel, with whom it has fought for years. 'Historical mistake' In December 2001, the Council of the European Union - representing the governments of member states - adopted a ""common position"" and a regulation to combat terrorism. It established a list of designated entities and people whose funds would be frozen. Hamas' military wing, the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, was named on the initial list, and its political wing was added two years later. Hamas contested the decision and on Wednesday the EU's General Court found it had been ""based not on acts examined and confirmed in decisions of competent authorities but on factual imputations derived from the press and the internet"". The court said it was therefore annulling Hamas' designation but would temporarily keep existing measures against the group ""in order to ensure the effectiveness of any possible future freezing of funds"". This would be maintained for three months, or, if an appeal is brought before the European Court of Justice, until it was closed, it added. ""The court stresses that those annulments, on fundamental procedural grounds, do not imply any substantive assessment of the question of the classification of Hamas as a terrorist group within the meaning of the common position."" Hamas deputy political leader Moussa Abu Marzouk said the decision was ""a correction of a historical mistake"". ""Hamas is a resistance movement and it has a natural right according to all international laws and standards to resist the occupation,"" he told the Reuters news agency. But European Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said the EU continued to ""consider Hamas a terrorist organisation"" and would consider its response to the ruling. The Israeli economy minister called the court's decision immoral. ""Israel is strong and can defend itself against its enemies, but those who will suffer from strengthening terrorist groups will be the Europeans themselves,"" Naftali Bennett warned. Hours after the ruling, the European Parliament adopted a compromise resolution supporting ""in principle recognition of Palestinian statehood and the two-state solution"", and calling for peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians to be ""advanced"". The original text had called for unconditional recognition, in line with resolutions passed by several national legislatures in recent months.",欧盟普通法院宣布欧盟把哈巴勒斯坦伊斯兰组织马斯列入恐怖名单的决定无效。,哈马斯的最终目标是消灭以色列 法官认为，把哈马斯列入黑名单的理由不恰当，欧盟做出的决定是基于新闻报道而不是对哈马斯行动的审查。 但是欧盟法院表示，这个裁决并不是重新评估是否应该把哈马斯定为恐怖组织。 法院表示，应暂时维持对哈马斯资金的冻结。 在2006年在西岸和加沙地带举行的巴勒斯坦议会选举中，哈马斯获胜。 哈马斯的最终目标是消灭以色列。 由于哈马斯长期从事暴力攻击并拒绝放弃武力，以色列，美国和其他几个国家都把它列为恐怖组织。 欧盟普通法院做出这个裁决正值欧洲议会准备就承认巴勒斯坦国举行投票。 (编译：董乐/责编：横路)
"Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah on Sunday extended a moratorium on the death penalty to cover the new legislation. The rethink follows global outcry over the laws, including boycotts and celebrity protests. While still on the statute books for some crimes, no executions have been carried out in Brunei since 1957. Last month Brunei rolled out a strict new interpretation of Islamic laws, or Sharia. In a speech, the sultan said he was aware there had been ""many questions and misperceptions"" regarding the implementation of the legislation, called Syariah Penal Code Order (SPCO). While saying that a moratorium on the death penalty would be applied to the SPCO he also defended the new rules, saying their ""merit"" would become clear. The speech marks the first time the country's ruler has spoken publicly about the legislation since their introduction. Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said she was ""delighted the death penalty has been removed and that the de facto moratorium which has been in place for more than two decades, will also cover the SPCO"". Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei and punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Muslims make up about two-thirds of the country's population of 420,000. What are the laws? The small South-East Asian nation first introduced Sharia law in 2014, giving it a dual legal system with both Sharia and Common Law. The first phase covered crimes punishable by prison sentences and fines. The laws introduced on 3 April marked the next phase of the legislation, and covered crimes punishable by amputation and stoning. Under the legislation: What was the reaction? The laws sparked international outrage, throwing the tiny South-East Asian nation into the global spotlight. Ahead of their implementation, the UN warned that the laws contravened international human rights standards set out in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights - which was ratified by Brunei in 2006. Celebrities including George Clooney and Elton John called for a boycott of luxury hotels with links to Brunei over the legislation. Mr Clooney said the new laws amounted to ""human rights violations"". Many in Brunei's gay community expressed shock and fear at the punishments.",文莱宣布撤回了上个月实施的法律，该法律宣示男性之间的性行为和通奸行为可以石刑处死。,英国同志团体在文莱持有的酒店外抗议 该国领导人苏丹·哈桑纳尔·博尔基亚（Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah）上周日（5月5日）宣布的新《伊斯兰刑法》（Syariah Penal Code Order，又称SPCO）中关于死刑相关的法令将暂缓实施。但他也为新法典辩护，称后者的“优点”将变得更清晰。这是该国统治者自上月以来首次公开谈论该立法。 英联邦秘书长帕特里夏·斯科特兰（ Patricia Scotland）表示，她“很高兴死刑已被取消”。 自1957年以来，文莱没有执行任何死刑处决。 在上周日的演讲中，哈桑纳尔·博尔基亚表示，他知道外界对于《伊斯兰刑法》有 许多“问题和误解。” 现年72岁的还领人掌握文莱投资局，旗下拥有其中一些世界顶尖的酒店 文莱的《伊斯兰法》 文莱在2014年第一次引入伊斯兰教法，当时已经受到广泛遣责。这令文莱拥有一个伊斯兰教法与普通法“并行”的法律体系。哈桑纳尔·博尔基亚当时说过，新的刑法将会经过几年时间才会全面施行。 2019新法令下，以死刑为刑罚的罪行包括强奸、通奸、鸡奸、行劫，以及冒犯或诋毁先知穆罕默德等等。 同性恋在文莱本身已经不合法，此前的最高刑罚是10年监禁。在新法下，同性恋行为的定罪需要个人自己承认，或者被四个证人目睹其实施同性行为。 其中女性间的性行为将会处以40下的鞭刑以及10年监禁。同样开始实施的还有，堕胎将被施行公开鞭刑，以及对盗窃者进行截肢。 新法也对一些规定作了修改，包括将“游说、要求或鼓励”18岁以下的穆斯林儿童“接受伊斯兰以外的其他宗教教育”列为犯罪。该法主要对穆斯林适用，但是其中一些方面也对非穆斯林居民有效。 新法下惊慌的文莱人 沙希兰·沙赫兰尼（Shahiran Shahrani ）是一名40岁的文莱同性恋者，目前正在加拿大寻求政治庇护，他表示在文莱已经能够感觉之前新刑法带来的影响。 这名前政府雇员在去年因为脸书上一则批评政府的帖文而被控煽动罪。 沙赫兰尼表示：“文莱的同志群体从来就不算开放，但是因为Grindr（一款同性恋交友手机软件APP）的到来帮助了人们秘密约会。但现在，我听到的是几乎都没有人在用Grindr了。” “他们害怕遇到一个假装同性恋的警察。这种事还没有发生，但是因为新的法规，人们很害怕。” 一名不愿公开身份的文莱同性恋男子向BBC说：“你一觉醒来发现，你的邻居、你的家人，甚至在路边卖炸虾油条的老奶奶都不把你当人，觉得用石头砸死你是可以的。” 另一名同性恋男子则希望新法不会广泛地实际执行。“说实话，我不会太害怕，因为这里的政府经常拿严酷刑罚来虚张声势。不过即使很少发生，但是它还有可能会发生。” 一名并非同性恋但已放弃伊斯兰教信仰的文莱男性则表示，看着新法实施感到“惊慌和无力”。“我们这些普通市民无力阻止伊斯兰教法实施”，这名不愿公开身份的23岁男子说。“在伊斯兰教法下，我会因为叛教而面临死刑。” 各界抵制起作用 文莱新法对同性恋者处以极刑的规定，激起了国际社会强烈抨击。各界评论这些国际压力对此次文莱撤回决定有所影响。 “文莱的刑法是一份有深刻漏洞的立法，当中有一系列侵犯人权的规定。”联合国对此作出回应，称有关立法残酷而不人道，指这是人权维护道路上的一次“严重倒退”。 一些名人亦发出呼吁，抵制这个机构旗下的豪华酒店，其中就有好莱坞影星乔治·克鲁尼（George Clooney）。“我们真的要间接资助这些侵犯人权的行为吗？”他呼吁，任何反对这些法律的人都应该抵制入住在美国、英国、法国和意大利的多切斯特酒店（Dorchester Hotel）。 乔治·克鲁尼（George Clooney）发起的抵制行动奏效。 德意志银行（Deutsche Bank）宣布所有员工差旅，不要下榻文莱政府拥有的饭店。 在压力团体的游说之下，伦敦市交通局（Transport for London）以违反广告原则的下，4月3日移除文莱航空在伦敦地铁站投放的广告。台湾也有同志谘询热线协会呼吁台北捷运公司撤下文莱航空公司广告。澳洲维珍航空（Virgin Australia）也跟进，取消与文莱皇家航空的员工旅游协议。 文莱档案 位于婆罗洲上的文莱由苏丹·哈桑纳尔·博尔基亚（Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah）统治，这个国家主要通过石油和天然气出口致富。穆斯林占该国42万人口的三分之二。 现年72岁的领导人还掌控文莱投资局（Brunei Investment Agency），旗下拥有其中一些世界顶尖的酒店，包括英国伦敦多切斯特酒店和美国洛杉矶比弗利山酒店（Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles）等等。 文莱的掌权贵族拥有巨额私有财产，占人口大多数的马来人享受着丰厚的政府福利且不需要纳税。
"One idea he suggested was limiting the number of children in a family that would be supported on benefits. Is it right to cut benefits in an attempt to bring down Britain's deficit? Does it make for good economics? Or good politics? Here are the opinions of a range of commentators, charities, think tanks and those who are on benefits - or managing without them. Kelly Spencer, 32, single parent to four young children, from Westbury, Wiltshire I'm in receipt of income support of £125 per fortnight, child tax credits of £230 per week, child benefit of £220 per month, housing benefit of £400 per month and council tax benefit of £100 per month. I'm an engineering graduate and I was made redundant just before my youngest child was born. I believe that everyone in this country should bear the brunt of the cuts, but at a level they can afford. I think it is wrong to cut benefits to such a level that people suffer extreme hardship and social inequality, especially where children are involved. I feel the politicians are out of touch and have led very privileged lives. I do not trust this government to look after vulnerable people. They don't seem to care. I can't understand why wealthy people are receiving child benefit - they don't need it. I know some people who give it straight to their kids as pocket money. Why are wealthy pensioners getting universal benefits such as bus pass or fuel allowances? I feel that the government is demonising people on benefits in order to gain popular support for policies. I feel like it is all about the votes and not about the real people it affects. I think it would be better politics to target people who break the law and cost the country a fortune - tax evaders or criminals, for example. I don't believe that cutting benefits makes economic sense in the long term. We will end up with a social underclass, resentment rising and an increase in crime and mental illness from stress of struggling to survive. All of this will cost the country dearly. Jurgita Sirvydiene, 31, admin worker, of Hornchurch, Essex, originally from Lithuania I was very pleased when I saw this on the news. My husband (who is 32 and a carpenter) and I have been working in this country for more than nine years now, we both have full-time jobs. I come from Lithuania and I was shocked that people in the UK on benefits can afford better life than the ones who work. This is totally wrong. The government should stop encouraging people to be out of work by paying them a fair amount of money, also it is not right that people on benefits can have two or more children, where working families can't afford to have children at all. In my opinion they are doing the right thing by cutting benefits, so people will have to get a job. If their earnings are not enough to survive on, only then should they be offered financial help. We need to forget the something-for-nothing culture. Finally George is doing something about it. They give too much money to the wrong people who are milking the system. It's not right. I think they need to be stricter. I earn £315 a week in hand, which works out as about £19,500 before tax a year. When I go on maternity leave I will be on 40% of my wages while people on benefits can afford to stay at home and have as many children as they like. Owen Jones, columnist at the Independent and author of Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class In the most cynical way possible, cutting benefits can certainly make good politics. Since coming to power, the government has attempted to turn the working poor against the unemployed, and the disabled against the non-disabled, over benefits. As a result, it has had some success in redirecting people's anger from those at the top who caused the crisis, to people's neighbours down the streets. But it is wrong to make the poorest pay for a crisis they did not create; and - given it doesn't address the root causes of welfare spending - these cuts will suck demand out of the economy as well as making people's lives a misery. It is possible to bring down welfare spending without savage cuts. Billions of pounds are wasted on housing benefit, but it's lining the pockets of wealthy landlords - not tenants - because both New Labour and the Tories failed to build social housing. Building modern housing would create jobs, stimulate the economy, bring down the five million-strong social housing waiting list - and cut welfare spending. Ruth Porter, Communications Director at free-market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs Welfare accounts for around 25% of government expenditure. It would be very difficult to bring down the deficit without reducing the welfare budget. By 2010 Gordon Brown had reformed welfare so that around a third of all UK households received more than 50% of their income from taxpayers. Not only would tackling this problem of welfare dependency help incentivise people to work harder and save more, it would also help to grow the economy by creating more opportunity and investment for the private sector. George Osborne argued in his conference speech that the government will look to govern in the national interest. It is time then for him to look at bringing to an end non-means-tested benefits for the elderly and to reduce other welfare payments that have gone beyond simply providing a safety net. Helen Barnard, programme manager for poverty at anti-poverty charity, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation More welfare cuts will not reduce people's dependency on the state. Cutting benefits for groups who receive little public sympathy may make for a good conference speech, but it risks increasing poverty and hardship. And unless there is a follow-up ""master plan"" for creating more and better jobs, massively increasing access to them and sorting out the housing crisis, it's not likely to do as much as those advocating further cuts are hoping to reduce the deficit or people's dependency on the state. Youth homelessness is driven by relationship breakdown. Our research shows that the assumption that most young people receiving housing benefit could happily and safely live with mum and dad until they get a stable, decently paid job and move into a basic but adequate shared flat is a world away from the lives of many poor, young people. This is reinforced by the statistics on underemployment - 6m people want to work more but can't. It also demonstrates that just ""getting a job"" isn't the whole point: millions are trapped in a cycle of poorly paid, insecure work and unemployment, with little prospect of breaking into better jobs. Getting a job is still the best route out of poverty. But these kinds of jobs aren't a very good route. When someone in a family in poverty gets a job, only 56% are lifted out of poverty. We are hoping to address these issues with a new programme to develop a UK-wide anti-poverty strategy based on the best evidence across all the areas that contribute to poverty. Maybe it'll catch on. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive, the Taxpayers' Alliance The welfare system needs to treat the taxpayers who pick up the bill fairly, not just those claiming benefits. It is important to encourage people to work, but also to ensure that those living on benefits don't enjoy a lifestyle which many families paying their own way could never afford. The benefits bill is way too high and steps must be taken to ensure that welfare spending is sustainable. It is wrong to characterise these plans as a way of quickly cutting the deficit - they aren't a short term fix. But they are vital to delivering value for money for taxpayers in the long run. The chancellor has to get the economy moving again by reforming taxes and leaving more money in people's pockets as well, so fewer people rely on handouts in the first place. Kay Bews, chief executive of family support charity, Home-Start UK We acknowledge that hard decisions need to be made, but this one is potentially giving rise to further difficulties and therefore costs in the future. Has Mr Osborne realised the impact this will have on families across society? Home-Start is seeing families who are at breaking point - many of those families were ""coping before"", getting by, but having to now support their families with even less money is tipping them over the edge. The families we work with who are claiming benefits are trying to do the best under very difficult circumstances. Very few benefits claimants choose that way of keeping a roof over their heads or food in their children's mouths - most simply don't have the option. And in times of economic stress, a cut in benefits will also affect the current tax payers who suddenly find themselves redundant. Home-Start is seeing the working poor unable to make ends meet. Removing benefits will not necessarily push families into work. A safety net is needed for all. We need to take a much longer-term view - possibly over generations. Investment in early intervention for families - whether they are working or on benefits - will help reduce police, prison, drug and alcohol, social services and national health service bills by billions of pounds in the longer term. But only time and hindsight will tell. It's potentially divisive [in terms of politics]. Will the long-term employed vote if they suddenly find that there is little or no support for them if they lose their job? There is also a real risk of widening the gap between families who once were coping with their finances and now won't be able to. Claire Fox, director of the Institute of Ideas, which debates social issues Yes it is right to cut benefits: less because it saves money in a narrow way, and more because it is a challenge to an unhelpful climate of complacency and dependency. It could be a commitment to make all sections of society focus on wealth creation and not on handouts. Of course for those million young people out of work in the UK, it can be galling when their meagre £71 a week unemployment pay is described as exemplifying a ""culture of entitlement""; when it seems those with least are the focus of the government's economic strategy. But my problem with contemporary welfarism is that it has long moved beyond its original remit of providing a safety net or delivering universal public services. Growing numbers have become permanently and cripplingly dependent on what was envisaged as a temporary measure in hard times. A mood of passively expecting the state to provide rather than a resilient atmosphere of ambitious, get-up-and-go dominates culture. The welfare state's expansion into every nook and cranny of too many people's lives has been less about saving people from deprivation and expresses more a condescending middle-class view of people as helpless and hapless unless the state helps them to parent correctly, improve their lifestyles, cut down on smoking or drinking, etc. Frankly, we should welcome cuts in a bureaucratic system that actively undermines people's autonomy and independence. And one reason these cuts are more popular with the vast majority of ordinary people, as opposed to professional hand-wringers, is they know damn well that over-weaning welfarism saps morale and is good for no-one. Ironically the coalition seems to be a reluctant cutter, for all the rhetoric. The so-called austerity harshness of lowering housing benefit limits from £20,000 annually- £1,700 a month - generous by anyone's budgetary standard - indicates just how much waste there is in the system: it's more about subsidising the social housing sector, than helping the needy. The solution of course would be ensuring millions more affordable homes and rents. And targeting under-25-year-olds makes some sense. This is after all the most dynamic section of society - with youth on their side they should be kicking out, not just against their parents and elders, but against a system that implies they won't be able to cope without official charity. So benefit cuts can mean freedom from dependence as much as hardship and at least need to considered by progressives rather than demonised as Thatcherite attacks on the poor. But without an equally ambitious plan for economic growth, Osborne's projected cuts will just cause pain without sufficient gain.",在英国保守党周一（10月8号）召开的年会上，财相奥斯本（George Osborne）宣布到2016-2017年政府将会削减价值100亿英镑的福利补贴。,奥斯本誓言要削减福利。 对于很多没有工作的父母来说，目前的规定是孩子越多，就获得越多的福利，但是奥斯本表示，如果这些父母再有子女，在福利上不会有任何增长。 这些新政策中还包括取消对38万25岁以下人士的房屋补贴，这样没有工作的年轻人就需要和很多工作的年轻人一样住在父母家中。而单这一项改革就有可能节省18亿英镑。 奥斯本表示，英国的福利体制应该支持那些非常有需要的人，但是也需要让那些没工作人士像工作的人士一样做出同样的选择。 另外，奥斯本还排除了对价值高昂的住宅收取更高税额的可能性。 自民党希望推出豪宅税，让那些居住在价值超过200万英镑住宅中的人士每年支付1%的附加税额。 奥斯本对BBC表示，富裕的人士需要支付更多的税收，然而预算不能只依赖于富人的钱包。 然而就在上个月，英国副首相克莱格（Nick Clegg）在自民党年会上表示，他不会允许通过最大地打击最贫困群体来平衡政府的收支。 然而奥斯本对此做出了辩护，他指出在自己每次做出政府预算之后，富人都需要支付更多的费用。 奥斯本表示，政府将会为英国大学的科研经费拨款两亿英镑，而政府在三月份的预算中已经宣布对科研投资一亿英镑。 然而各大学必需要从私人企业或者慈善机构获得等同于政府拨款两倍的款项，这样在科研项目上的经费总额就可以达到超过10亿英镑。 与内文相关的链接 相关话题
"By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent Researchers believe we could soon cross a threshold leading to boiling hot temperatures and towering seas in the centuries to come. Even if countries succeed in meeting their CO2 targets, we could still lurch on to this ""irreversible pathway"". Their study shows it could happen if global temperatures rise by 2C. An international team of climate researchers, writing in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, says the warming expected in the next few decades could turn some of the Earth's natural forces - that currently protect us - into our enemies. Each year the Earth's forests, oceans and land soak up about 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon that would otherwise end up in our atmosphere adding to temperatures. But as the world experiences warming, these carbon sinks could become sources of carbon and make the problems of climate change significantly worse. So whether it is the permafrost in northern latitudes that now holds millions of tonnes of warming gases, or the Amazon rainforest, the fear is that the closer we get to 2 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, the greater the chances that these natural allies will spew out more carbon than they currently now take in. Back in 2015, governments of the world committed themselves to keeping temperature rises well below 2 degrees, and to strive to keep them under 1.5. According to the authors, the current plans to cut carbon may not be enough if their analysis is correct. ""What we are saying is that when we reach 2 degrees of warming, we may be at a point where we hand over the control mechanism to Planet Earth herself,"" co-author Prof Johan Rockström, from the Stockholm Resilience Centre, told BBC News. ""We are the ones in control right now, but once we go past 2 degrees, we see that the Earth system tips over from being a friend to a foe. We totally hand over our fate to an Earth system that starts rolling out of equilibrium."" Currently, global temperatures have risen about 1 degree above pre-industrial levels and they are rising by around 0.17C per decade. In their new study the authors looked at 10 natural systems, which they term ""feedback processes"". Right now, these help humanity to avoid the worst impacts of carbon and temperature rises, and include forests, Arctic sea-ice, and methane hydrates on the ocean floor. The worry is that if one of these systems tips over and starts pushing large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, the rest could follow like a row of dominoes. What exactly is a Hothouse Earth scenario? In short, it's not good. According to the research paper, crossing into a Hothouse Earth period would see a higher global temperature than at any time in the past 1.2 million years. The climate might stabilise with 4-5 degrees C of warming above the pre-industrial age. Thanks to the melting of ice sheets, the seas could be 10-60 metres higher than now. Essentially, this would mean that some parts of the Earth would become uninhabitable. The impacts would be ""massive, sometimes abrupt and undoubtedly disruptive,"" say the authors. The only upside, if you can call it that, is that the worst impacts may not be felt for a century or two. The downside is that we wouldn't really be able to do anything about it, once it starts. Are the current heatwaves in the UK and Europe evidence of a Hothouse Earth? The authors say the extreme weather events we are seeing right now around the world cannot be immediately associated with the risk of passing 2 degrees C. However, they argue that it may be evidence that the Earth is more sensitive to warming than previously thought. ""One should learn from these extreme events and take these as a piece of evidence that we should be even more cautious,"" said Prof Rockström. ""It may support the conclusion that if this can happen at one degree, then we should at least not be surprised or too dismissive of conclusions that things can happen more abruptly than we previously thought."" Surely we've known about these risks before? What these authors are saying is that up to now, we've underestimated the power and sensitivity of natural systems. People have been thinking that climate change would be a global emergency for everyone if temperatures rose 3-4 degrees by the end of this century. But this paper argues that beyond 2 degrees, there is a significant risk of turning natural systems - that presently help keep temperatures down - into massive sources of carbon that would put us on an ""irreversible pathway"" to a world that is 4-5 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution. Any good news here at all? Surprisingly, yes! We can avoid the hothouse scenario but it's going to take a fundamental re-adjustment of our relationship with the planet. ""Climate and other global changes show us that we humans are impacting the Earth system at the global level. This means that we as a global community can also manage our relationship with the system to influence future planetary conditions. ""This study identifies some of the levers that can be used to do so,"" says co-author Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen. So not only are we going to have to stop burning fossil fuels by the middle of this century, we are going to have to get very busy with planting trees, protecting forests, working out how to block the Sun's rays and developing machines to suck carbon out of the air. The authors say a total re-orientation of human values, equity, behaviour and technologies is required. We must all become stewards of the Earth. What do other scientists say? Some say the authors of this paper are too extreme. Many others say their conclusions are sound. ""As a result of human impacts on climate, the new paper argues that we've gone beyond any chance of the Earth cooling 'of its own accord',"" said Dr Phil Williamson from the University of East Anglia, UK. ""Together these effects could add an extra half a degree Celsius by the end of the century to the warming that we are directly responsible for ‒ thereby crossing thresholds and tipping points that seem likely to occur around 2 degrees C, and committing the planet to irreversible further change, as Hothouse Earth."" Others are concerned that the authors' faith in humanity to grasp the serious nature of the problem is misplaced. ""Given the evidence of human history, this would seem a naive hope,"" said Prof Chris Rapley, from University College London. ""At a time of the widespread rise of right-wing populism, with its associated rejection of the messages of those perceived as 'cosmopolitan elites' and specific denial of climate change as an issue, the likelihood that the combination of factors necessary to allow humanity to navigate the planet to an acceptable 'intermediate state' must surely be close to zero.""",乍眼一看，这有点像是低成本科幻电影的标题，但对于行星学家来说，“温室地球”是一个非常严肃的理论。,"研究人员认为，在未来几个世纪里，我们很快就会越过一个临界点，来到一个高温沸腾、海平面极具上升的世界。 即使各国成功实现二氧化碳的减排目标，我们仍继续疾驰在这条“不可逆转的道路”上。研究表明，如果全球气温升高2℃，就会发生这种情况。 国际气候研究小组在美国《国家科学院院刊》（Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences）撰写的文章表示，预计未来几十年的全球变暖可能会将目前地球上保护我们的自然力量变成我们的敌人。 每年地球的森林、海洋和陆地会吸收大约45亿吨的碳，否则这些碳将最终进入大气层导致温度升高。 世界很多地方会受“温室地球”影响。 但随着世界变暖，这些碳储库反而会成为碳的来源，并使气候变化问题显著恶化。 因此，无论是现在储存数百万吨温室气体的北纬地区的永久冻土，还是亚马逊热带雨林，人们担心我们越接近平均气温较工业革命前的升高2℃，这些天然的盟友吐出的碳比现在吸收的要多。 2015年，世界各国政府承诺将温度上升控制在2℃以内，并努力将温度升高控制在1.5℃以内。该文章的作者说，如果他们的分析正确，目前碳减排计划很可能是不够的。 “当达到气温上升2℃的临界点时，我们将会把控制权拱手交还给地球。” 共同作者斯德哥尔摩恢复中心的约翰·罗克斯特伦（Johan Rockström）教授告诉BBC新闻。 “我们现在有控制权，但一旦超过2℃，我们就会见证地球从朋友变成敌人的过程。我们完全把命运交给一个开始滚动失衡的地球系统”。 北极融化的冰层将减少反射回大气层的太阳光量。 目前，全球气温已经比工业化前的水平提高约1℃，并且还在以每十年约0.17℃速度上升。 在他们的新研究中，作者研究了10个他们称之为""反馈机制""的自然系统。 这些系统包括森林、北极海冰，还有海床上的甲烷水合物。它们现在都有助于人类避免碳排放增加和温度升高带来的最严重影响。 令人担心的是，如果其中一个系统翻转并开始将大量二氧化碳排放到大气中，其余的就像一排多米诺骨牌一样随之倾覆。 “温室地球”究竟是什么样的？ 简而言之，它并不好。 在温度更高的地区的世界中，洪水和被侵蚀的海岸是需要面临的主要问题。 根据研究报告，进入""温室地球""时期后，全球气温将比过去120万年间都要高。 气候温度将维持高于工业革命前气温4-5 ℃的水平。由于冰盖融化，海平面将比现在高10-60米。 这意味着地球的某些地区将无法居住。 作者说，这些影响将是""巨大的，有时是突然的，但无疑是破坏性的""。 如果说有唯一的好处，那就是在一两个世纪之内可能感受不到最严重的影响。缺点是，一旦开始，我们将对此无能为力。 英国和欧洲目前的热浪是否是""温室地球""的证据？ 作者说，我们现在看到世界各地的极端天气事件，与气温升高超过2℃的风险没有直接联系。 然而，他们认为这可以证明，地球对气温升高的敏感度比以往人们认知的要高。 “人们应该从这些极端天气事件中吸取教训，并将这些事件视为我们应该更加谨慎的证据，” 罗克斯特伦教授说。 “这也可以论证，如果这种情况在一定程度上会发生，那么我们至少不该轻视问题或对其感到惊讶，事情发生得比我们想象地更突然。” 我们之前就清晰地知道这些风险吗？ 作者想强调的是，到目前为止，我们都低估了自然系统的威力和敏感度。 人们一直认为，如果到本世纪末温度上升3-4℃，气候变化将是全球性的紧急情况。 但是本文认为，气温上升超过2℃，就极可能将原本有助于将降低温度的自然系统，变成巨大的碳储库。这会把我们带上一条无法回头的路，去到一个气温比工业革命前上升4-5℃的世界。 有什么好消息吗？ 令人惊讶的是，有的！ 我们可以避开“温室地球”的情景，但这需要全盘调整我们与地球的关系。 气候和其他全球性变化向我们展示，人类正在全球范围内影响地球系统。这意味着我们作为一个全球社区也可以改善我们与自然系统的关系，以影响这颗行星未来的状况。 来自哥本哈根大学的共同作者凯瑟琳·理查森说：“这项研究确定了我们可以采用的一些杠杆措施。” 因此，到本世纪中叶，我们不仅要停止燃烧化石燃料，还要大量种植树木，保护森林，研究如何阻挡太阳光线以及研发从大气里吸收碳的机器。 作者说，我们必须要全面重新定位人类价值观，公平，行为和技术。我们都必须成为地球的管家。 正如作者所说，像本模型所示，从大气层中去除二氧化碳是必要的。 其他科学家怎么说？ 有人说这篇论文的作者太极端了。但也有人说他们的结论是合理的。 英国东英吉利大学的菲尔·威廉姆森（Phil Williamson）博士说：“由于人类对气候的影响，新论文认为我们没有留给地球冷却自身的任何机会。” “到本世纪末，这些影响会在人类直接导致的影响上再增加0.5℃的气温上升，这就会超过上升2℃的临界点，给地球带来不可逆转的进一步改变，例如温室地球。” 其他人则担心作者对人性能否把握问题的严重性有迷之自信。 “纵观人类历史，这似乎是一种天真的希望。”伦敦大学学院的克里斯·拉普利（Chris Rapley）教授说。"
"By Emily McAuliffeBusiness reporter, Melbourne, Australia ""The atmosphere is usually one of enthusiasm, excitement, anticipation and curiosity,"" he says. If you asked people to try to picture hunting for truffles, the expensive subterranean fungi, many would no doubt imagine men with dogs going through woodlands in France or Italy. Given that truffles have been harvested in both countries for centuries, this is understandable. Yet since 1999 they have been joined by Australia, which in just 20 years has become the world's fourth-largest producer of the most-prized type of black truffle - the French black or périgord. Some in the Australian industry, such as Mr Wood, the owner of Truffle Paddock, a truffle farm in the state of Victoria, even believe that in another decade's time the country could take the number one position. While exact country-by-country figures are difficult to come by, given the secrecy that surrounds the ""diamonds in the dirt"", Australia is expected to harvest between 14 and 18 tonnes of French blacks this year. This compares with an estimated 60 tonnes last winter in Spain, 30 tonnes in Italy, and slightly more than Australia in France. (Industry experts say it is notoriously difficult to quantify French production figures due to a lack of data, and accusations that it imports périgords from Spain that then become ""French"".) What is not in doubt is that selling fresh French blacks is a very lucrative business. Much in demand in the world's finest restaurants, they can retail for up to $1,300 (£1,000) a kg. Not native to Australia, they were first introduced to the country in the mid 1990s, with the first Australian truffles unearthed in 1999. To cultivate or farm the truffles, trees - typically oak and hazelnut saplings - are replanted after their roots have been inoculated with the fungus' spores. Then five to eight years later you can start to harvest the resulting black truffles. As périgord truffles are harvested in the autumn and winter, the season in Australia runs from May until mid August. Geoff Barrett, co-founder and managing director of Oak Valley Truffles in Western Australia, says this gives the country's producers a huge advantage because they are selling their crop when they are none available from Europe. ""Australia's truffle industry is doing so well because we don't have any competitors,"" he says. ""We produce truffles in the southern hemisphere when there are none in the northern hemisphere."" Given that fresh truffles only have a shelf life of two weeks, it means that thanks to Australia's crop, chefs in the northern hemisphere can now sell dishes including the priced ingredient in their spring and summer. ""We export to 31 countries, and don't have the supply by even half to match the demand from overseas,"" says Alex Wilson, head of sales at The Truffle & Wine Co - Australia's first commercial truffle farm or truffière, and the single largest producer of black truffles in the southern hemisphere. ""We export around 85% of our truffles and I pre-sell the whole crop,"" he says. Truffle & Wine Co is so bullish about the industry's growth that it has ripped up around 80% of its former vineyards in Western Australia to allow expansion of the truffière. While Western Australia, and more specifically, the town of Manjimup, produces the lion's share of Australia's périgord truffles - there are now 300 farms scattered across the country, and this number is expected to grow. Colin Carter, vice president of the Australian Truffle Growers Association, says that his members are well versed on how to produce good crops, such as adding limestone to their soils to reach the desired alkaline levels. Mr Wilson says this knowhow means that the industry in Australia is ""leaps and bounds ahead"" of more recent efforts to farm truffles in South Africa, and countries in South America. ""Australia has a multi-tonne commercial industry, while places such as South Africa are still finding their feet,"" he adds. Alongside Australia's successful exports, a small domestic market is also developing. While truffles have long been a menu staple in Europe, the delicate fungus is a more recent addition to Australia's gastronomy scene, so part of the challenge for local growers has been around education and raising the profile of truffles. ""If you mentioned truffles to someone in Australia 20 years ago, most would have assumed you were talking about a chocolate,"" says Barrett. ""Now I'd say 95% of people know what a truffle is, and many are inquisitive as to how they're grown and used."" Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: French-born chef Philippe Mouchel says he's noticed greater consumer awareness of truffles at his namesake restaurant in Melbourne's central business district. ""During the Australian season we use fresh black truffles across much of our menu and people ask for it,"" he says. ""If you look around Melbourne, everyone is doing truffle degustation dinners throughout winter and they're so popular they sell out. ""There are more and more truffles around, chefs want to work with them and people want to enjoy them."" To help continue to raise this awareness, Mr Wood of Truffle Paddock, helps to organise an annual truffle festival in Melbourne. And back on his truffle farm he has just spent the autumn and winter welcoming visitors to join him and his dogs hunting for the precious crop. ""On most hunts, guests are invited to smell the truffle in the earth before it's harvested, and sometimes get to dig out the truffle,"" he says. ""People really enjoy that part and often want to buy the truffle they harvested to take home, share, and most likely brag about."" Regarding the wider industry in the country, he says: ""There is good reason to think that Australia could become the world's largest producer of black truffles within the decade. ""Some Western Australia estimates suggest that in 10 years their production will quadruple, as many newer and very large and medium-sized farms come into production. And although the east coast is usually characterised by small to medium-sized farms, more recently some large farms have also been established.""",当他的几只狗在土壤下嗅出一株珍贵的黑松露（black truffle）时，伍德先生（Nigel Wood）告诉我们说，对那些在狗身旁的人来说，这也是一个令人激动的时刻。 “那时候的气氛通常是热情、兴奋、期待和好奇，”他说。,"伍德先生与他的松露搜索团队。 如果让人们想象寻找松露（一种昂贵的地下食用真菌）的过程，多数人无疑会想象一位牵着狗的人，正经过法国或意大利的林地。因为，几个世纪以来，这两个国家已经成为发现黑松露的主要地方。 然而，自从1999年以来，在短短20年间，澳大利亚已成为世界上第四大最珍贵的黑松露（French Black），或称佩里戈尔松露（périgord）的生产国。从事黑松露买卖的人士，例如维多利亚州松露园（Truffle Paddock）的伍德先生，甚至相信在未来十年，澳大利亚可能成为首屈一指的松露生产国。 松露：泥土里的钻石。 黑松露被称为“泥土下的钻石”。虽然围绕黑松露有许多秘密，确切的国家或地区的黑松露生产数据很难得到，但澳大利亚预计今年将收获14至18公吨的黑松露。 相比之下，西班牙去年冬天估计为60公吨，意大利为30公吨，以及略高于澳大利亚的法国。业内专家表示，由于缺乏数据，法国黑松露的生产数据难以量化，并批评法国从西班牙进口黑松露，让后者随即变成了“法国”特有生产的佩里戈尔品种的黑松露。 总之，出售新鲜的法国黑松露毫无疑问是个利润颇丰的生意。世界上最好的餐厅对这款黑松露的需求量很大，每公斤的零售价可高达1,300美元（约1,000英镑）。 实际上，这款黑松露不是来自澳大利亚本土，它们是在20世纪90年代中期首次引入该国，并在1999年挖出了第一批澳大利亚松露。 为培育或种植松露，通常是在橡树和榛子树的根部接种松露的真菌孢子，再重新培育树木。之后5到8年后，便可以开始采收在树木根部养育而成的松露。 西澳大利亚“橡树谷松露”（Oak Valley Truffles）创始人和董事总经理巴瑞特（Geoff Barrett）先生说，由于佩里戈尔黑松露品种是在秋冬两季收成，相当于是澳大利亚的5月到8月中旬之间。因此，现在澳大利亚的松露商人有很大优势，因为当欧洲没有松露时，澳大利亚便能出售他们的产品。 巴瑞特强调，“澳大利亚的松露产业做得很好，因为我们没有任何竞争对手。当北半球没有松露时，我们就在南半球生产。” 黑松露是在秋冬两季收成。 鉴于新鲜松露的保存期只有两周，这便意味着北半球的餐厅，现在可以在春夏两季，兜售来自南半球澳大利亚的松露菜肴。 澳大利亚第一个商业松露农场，也是南半球最大的黑松露生产商——“松露与酒”公司销售主管威尔逊（Alex Wilson）称：“我们的松露出口到31个国家，但供应还是没法满足海外的需求，甚至连一半都没有。” 他补充说：“我们出口了大约85％的松露，而且全部都是预售出去的。” périgord 松露十分昂贵。 “松露与酒”公司对松露产业的增长十分乐观，该公司也已经改造了西澳大利亚约80％的前葡萄园成为培育松露的园地，以扩大松露产量。 西澳大利亚州，尤其是曼吉麻普镇占据了澳大利亚佩里戈尔黑松露生产的大部分份额。不过，现在全澳也有300家松露农场，预计生产量还会增长。 澳大利亚“松露培育者协会”副主席卡特（Colin Carter）说，他们的会员精通如何生产优质的松露，例如在土壤中添加石灰石以达到种植松露所需的土壤碱性水平。 世界上最好的餐厅对这款黑松露的需求量很大。 威尔逊先生解释，这种专业知识意味着澳大利亚的松露产业突飞猛进，比起最近在南非以及南美洲等国家种植松露超前许多，“澳大利亚已经有高产量的松露贸易，但像南非仍然才刚开始。” 除了成功出口外，澳大利亚国内的松露小市场也正在发展中。虽然松露长期以来一直在欧洲的菜单上，但这种奇特的真菌，现在是澳大利亚美食界的新成员。因此，对当地种植者来说，现在的挑战之一是如何教育公众和提高松露的形象。 巴瑞特表示，“如果在20年前向澳大利亚人提到松露，多数人会认为，你说的是某种巧克力”； “但现在95％的澳大利亚人都知道松露是什么。而且很多人对于松露如何培育以及食用都很感兴趣”。 法国出生的厨师菲利普·穆谢尔（Philippe Mouchel）表示，他注意到墨尔本中央商务区同名餐厅对松露的消费意识增强。穆谢尔说，在松露收获进入澳大利亚季节的时候，“我们在大部分的菜单上都使用新鲜的黑松露，人们也会要求有松露。” “在墨尔本，整个冬天人们都在做可品尝松露的晚餐，松露很受欢迎，马上卖光了；”他还说：“周围的松露越来越多，厨师希望菜肴中有松露，食客也希望品尝松露。” 为了继续帮助公众提高这种意识，维多利亚州松露农场的伍德在墨尔本组织了一年一度的松露节。在松露农场的秋冬季节，伍德都在欢迎游客和他的狗一起寻找珍贵的黑松露。 世界上最好的餐厅都对这款黑松露的需求量很大。 “在寻找过程中，游客可在收获松露之前先在泥地上闻一闻它们，有时可以参与挖出松露的活动。”他说，“人们非常喜欢这一活动，并且经常想把挖出的松露买下并带回家，与人分享，并顺便向人吹嘘这一段经历。” 伍德说：“有充分理由认为，澳大利亚可能在十年内成为世界上最大的黑松露生产国。” “西澳大利亚州的一些估计数字显示，10年后，随着许多新农场和大中型农场投入生产，黑松露的产量将翻两番。虽然东海岸通常是一些中小型的黑松露农场，但最近也建成了一些大型农场。”"
