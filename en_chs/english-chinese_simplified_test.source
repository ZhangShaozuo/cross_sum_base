Jose Luis Abarca was detained by federal officers in the capital, Mexico City, a police spokesman said. Mexican officials have accused Mr Abarca of ordering police to confront the students on the day of their disappearance on 26 September. Eyewitnesses described seeing them being bundled into police cars. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto praised the work of prosecutors and the security forces. "I hope that [the couple's] arrest will clarify many points being investigated by federal prosecutors," Mr Pena Nieto said. Unknown whereabouts Mexican officials had issued an arrest warrant for Mr Abarca and his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda, after Iguala police officers said they had received an order from the mayor to intercept the students. The officers said they had been told to stop the students from interrupting a speech given by Ms Pineda in Iguala on that day. "This was the missing piece. This arrest will help us find our kids," Felipe de la Cruz, a parent of one of the missing told Milenio television. The students, from a nearby teacher training college, had travelled to Iguala to raise funds and protest. They have not been seen since. A search has uncovered a series of mass graves in the area, but initial tests suggested they were not those of the students. Since then, more bodies have been uncovered and officials have cast doubt on the accuracy of the initial tests. More forensic tests are currently being carried out. Timeline: Iguala disappearance 26 Sept: Students from a teacher training college in Ayotzinapa travel to Iguala to protest and raise funds Night of 26 Sept: Police stop the students, 6 people are shot dead, 43 students disappear 30 Sept: Iguala mayor Jose Luis Abarca asks for leave from his post, which is granted 4 Oct: Mass graves are found near Iguala containing 28 bodies 19 Oct: Federal police are deployed to Iguala and replace the municipal force 22 Oct: Mexico's prosecutor general says an arrest warrant has been issued for Mr Abarca, his wife and the town's police chief 23 Oct: Guerrero state governor Angel Aguirre resigns 29 Oct: President Enrique Pena Nieto meets the relatives of the missing students and promises a "renewed search plan" 4 Nov: Mr Abarca and his wife are arrested in Mexico City Mr Abarca and Ms Pineda were arrested in a house they had rented in Iztapalapa, a neighbourhood of Mexico City. They did not resist arrest. They have been taken for questioning. Officials hope they will be able to shed light on the whereabouts of the students. Public outrage The events of 26 September have shocked Mexicans and have led to mass protests demanding that the authorities do more to find the missing students. The 43 were part of a larger group which had gone to Iguala to protest against what they said were discriminatory hiring practices. The students all attended a teacher training college in Ayotzinapa with a history of left-wing activism, and their presence in Iguala raised alarm bells with the local authorities. When the students boarded busses to return to their college, they were stopped by police - allegedly on the orders of Mayor Abarca. The officers opened fire and killed three students and three people in nearby vehicles. They stopped one busload of students trying to flee and took them to a local police station. According to police officers detained as part of the investigation, they then handed the students over to a local drugs gang. The gang's leader, who has also been arrested, says he ordered the students be "made to disappear", after having been told they belonged to a rival gang. However, he did not specify further what happened to them. The gang leader also accused Ms Pineda of being "the main operator of criminal activities in Iguala". The relatives of the missing students said on Monday that "no progress" had been made in the search for the 43 and expressed their anger over the slow pace of the investigation. The governor of the state of Guerrero, where Iguala is located, resigned last month over the disappearances.
In a keynote speech, Mr Carney said a rate rise "could happen sooner than markets currently expect". The consensus among economists was that rates would rise in the first half of next year, or even earlier. BBC economics editor Robert Peston said that although the comments point to an increase this year, any rise "will be small and gradual". Mr Carney was speaking in London on Thursday at the annual Mansion House dinner attended by City and business grandees. 'Gradual' He acknowledged there was "already great speculation about the exact timing of the first rate hike" from their record low of 0.5%, adding that the decision was "becoming more balanced". Mr Carney emphasised that there was "no pre-set course" on when to raise rates. There was more spare capacity in the economy that would need to be used up first, he said. And he also reiterated that the timing of the first rise was less important than the speed at which subsequent increases were made. "We expect that eventual increases in Bank rate will be gradual and limited," he said. Speaking at the Mansion House just before Mr Carney, Chancellor George Osborne confirmed plans to give the Bank new powers to prevent the housing market from overheating. These will include capping the size of mortgage loans compared to income or the value of the house. The new powers would be given to the Bank's Financial Policy Committee by the end of this Parliament, Mr Osborne said. He said: "We saw from the last crisis the dangerous temptations for politicians to leave the punch bowl where it is and keep the party going on for too long. "I want to make sure that the Bank of England has all the weapons it needs to guard against risks in the housing market. "I want to protect those who own homes, protect those who aspire to own a home, and protect the millions who suffer when boom turns to bust." Too much risk Mr Osborne also announced reforms to planning laws designed to increase the supply of housing. These should provide permission for up to 200,000 new homes, the government says. The chancellor said the housing market did not pose an immediate threat to financial stability, but that if left unchecked, it may do so in the future. He said the risks come from homeowners borrowing too much to pay for their houses. This is a problem not just for the borrowers, but for the banks that lend them the money, he said. There are concerns that when interest rates rise from their current record lows, many homeowners could struggle with their mortgage repayments. Earlier on Thursday, Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was "appalled" that some banks had been lending five times a mortgage applicant's income, suggesting a "stable level" was up to 3.5 times. Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics found prices rising at an annual rate of 17% in London, compared with 8% in the UK as a whole. This has led to fears that an unsustainable bubble is developing in the housing market. However, last week the Nationwide Building Society said it had seen signs that house price rises were starting to cool, while the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said momentum in the housing market was beginning to slow. Analysis: Jonty Bloom, BBC Business Correspondent Mark Carney was headhunted from Canada to be the Governor of the Bank of England. That is why his speeches are occasionally enlivened with obscure references to ice hockey, moose or, as in Thursday's speech, a rather strained metaphor linking central banking to canoeing. But it was a much less colourful line in the speech that grabbed the headlines. The first rate hike "could happen sooner than markets currently expect", he said. Let me translate from Canadian. Everyone has been betting interest rates won't rise this year. They are wrong. Until Thursday the consensus was that rates would stay at 0.5% for until at least the beginning of next year and possibly longer. But the economy is now growing far more strongly than predicted, and that means the Bank is thinking about when to raise rates and calm things down.
Mrs Tindall's husband, rugby player Mike Tindall, was present at the birth of their first child at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the families of both parents were all delighted at the news, Buckingham Palace said. The baby, as yet unnamed, becomes 16th in line for the throne. Mrs Tindall later left the hospital and returned home. Her husband expressed his joy on Twitter: "Thanks so much for all your kind messages. Definitely the best day of my life today, so happy! The girls are both doing great!" In another tweet, he praised hospital staff, writing: "Big thanks to all involved at Gloucester Royal, they were fantastic!" Mr and Mrs Tindall were married at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh in July 2011. The new arrival is the third grandchild of the Princess Royal and her first husband, Mark Phillips - and the Queen and Prince Philip's fourth great-grandchild. The birth follows that of Prince George in July last year to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. In a statement, the Queen's press secretary said: "The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Princess Royal, Captain Mark Phillips and Mike's parents, Mr Phillip and Mrs Linda Tindall, have been informed and are delighted with the news. "The baby's name will be confirmed in due course." Prime Minister David Cameron said: "It's wonderful news and I'm absolutely delighted for the couple. I know them a little and I know they'll be absolutely devoted and delighted parents, so happy news all round." BBC Royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the couple had chosen an NHS hospital, the Gloucestershire Royal, for the birth. Mrs Tindall, 32, does not hold a royal title and is not referred to as Her Royal Highness. Her daughter will be known as Miss Tindall. The new parents met during England's Rugby World Cup-winning campaign in Australia in 2003. Mr Tindall, 34, a former England rugby star, is now a player-coach at Gloucester. His wife has achieved sporting success in her own right - where she still competes under the name Zara Phillips - winning individual gold in three-day eventing at the World Equestrian Games in Germany in 2006. The title helped her become BBC Sports Personality of the Year later that year, following in the footsteps of her mother, Princess Anne, who won the award in 1971. As a member of the Great Britain eventing team she won a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She is planning to take part in the next Olympic Games, which will be held in Rio in 2016.
By Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Tokyo A month ago, there were very few who would have predicted what we are now witnessing. Firstly no one expected Mr Abe to go, certainly not before his beloved Tokyo Olympics. Even fewer would have guessed Mr Suga as his replacement. The 71-year-old is known in Japan as Mr Abe's fixer, the backroom guy who gets stuff done. When asked recently whether he thought of himself as a nice guy, Mr Suga responded: "I am very nice to those who do their job properly." His public face is that of the unsmiling and seemingly charmless government spokesman. His nickname among Japanese journalists is the "Iron Wall", a reference to his refusal to respond to questions he doesn't like. So how is it that Mr Suga is now suddenly Japan's new prime minister? According to economist and long-time Tokyo resident Jesper Koll, Mr Suga was chosen by Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) bosses, the faction leaders who wield power behind the scenes, because they saw no obvious alternative. "This is obviously an election in smoky rooms right inside the LDP," he says. "The public had no voice in this choice of the prime minister of Japan. "In the end, you're only any good to your party if you can win victories in public elections. So, he is under pressure. He is going to have to prove himself to the party and to the Japanese people that he deserves to be prime minister," says Mr Koll. Mr Suga is clearly not without political skills. He has served as Japan's chief cabinet secretary for longer than any of his predecessors. He has a reputation for toughness and discipline and for understanding the machinery of Japan's byzantine bureaucracy. But are those the sorts of skills that win elections? Professor Koichi Nakano from Tokyo's Sophia University thinks not. "He rose to power because he has the political skills of intimidating opponents, including the press and dominating the scene through backdoor dealings and controlling the bureaucrats quite well," he says. "But when it comes to the public face of the party, when the lower house election needs to be called within a year, he's really unsuited because he's not very eloquent." That lack of eloquence was on display as Mr Suga made his victory speech on Monday. In ponderous tones with long pregnant pauses he promised the following. "I want to break down bureaucratic sectionalism, vested interests, and the blind adherence to precedent." But Mr Koll is someone who knows Mr Suga personally and he says we shouldn't be so quick to dismiss him. "Here is a man who gets up at 5am in the morning, does 100 sit ups and then reads all the newspapers," he says. "By 6:30am, he's starting meetings with business people, with advisers, with outside economists. He absorbs like a sponge and wants to get things done for the country. He's not interested in any of the glitz or bling that comes with the government." The new premier's eschewal of "glitz and bling" is put down to his humble origins. Mr Suga was born in a small village in the snowy north of Japan, the son of a strawberry farmer. According to a 2016 biography, he couldn't wait to escape the rural backwater. At 18 he left for Tokyo. There he worked in a cardboard factory saving to pay his own way through university. That sets Mr Suga apart from most of his predecessors, like Mr Abe, whose father was Japan's foreign minister, and grandfather prime minister. Mr Suga's "origins" story is a good one, but according to Professor Nakano it makes him extremely vulnerable in the sometimes vicious factional struggles inside Japan's ruling party. "Because Mr Suga comes from a humble background, he really doesn't have his own power base," he says. "He doesn't belong to any faction. He rose to power because he was Mr Abe's preferred choice. And the party bosses rally behind him in an emergency situation. But once the emergency situation is gone and once the party bosses start to realise that they are not getting all they wanted, I'm sure there is going to be a power struggle." There are many well connected "young pretenders" waiting in the wings, waiting for Mr Suga to make a mistake. And there are many things that could go wrong. Before he announced his departure, Prime Minister Abe's approval rating had fallen to 30%, largely over discontent at the way he's handled the Covid-19 crisis. Mr Abe's greatest achievement was to give Japan a long period of political stability. Before his election in 2012, Japan had seen 19 prime ministers in the previous 30 years. It was called "the revolving door", and some worry Japan is now poised to return to factional infighting and short-lived governments. "It does seem to be the case that after a long-serving prime minister, we get short-lived ones," says Kristi Govella, a Japan watcher at the University of Hawaii. "I think it's likely we will now enter a period of more short-lived prime ministers. It's not clear if they'll be every 10 months or rather every two years. It would certainly be beneficial for Japan if it were not a different person every year." For Prime Minister Suga, those are not reassuring words. He has a lot to prove, and probably not very long to do so.
By Juliana LiuHong Kong correspondent, BBC News When I was three years old, after months of begging, my parents finally gave in to my pleas for a puppy. The day that my uncle, a lorry driver, brought me a fuzzy yellow mongrel from my grandmother's mountainous, faraway home was the happiest of my young life. I named him "Doggie", and we immediately became inseparable. As an only child born in 1979 at the beginning of China's one-child policy, I had always been alone, and Doggie became my best friend. He loved running around outside our one-room flat, gobbling up left-over rice and snuggling near the coal fire. But these halcyon days did not last. After just one winter, my parents told me Doggie had to go. In Chinese cities in the early 1980s owning a pet was considered highly undesirable, bourgeois behaviour. None of my neighbours had one. It was also not entirely legal. There was no access to animal vaccines or vets, so pets could pose a public health risk. One day, my mother announced we were going shopping - and when we returned a few hours later Doggie was no more. He had been strung up by the legs in our communal yard, and was soon turned into a stew, complete with herbs and hard-boiled eggs. No-one paid any attention to my tears. I heard the neighbours say I would soon forget the whole thing. They, on the other hand, were in a celebratory mood. In the years before China's economic boom, when some food was still rationed, it was rare to have the chance to feast on a whole animal. I refused to eat the stew - and I have never eaten dog in my life. In China, the tradition of dog-eating goes back far beyond written history. Along with pigs, oxen, goats, horses and fowl, dogs are one of the six animals domesticated during the Stone Age. On the other hand, it is not the kind of thing that is eaten every day. It is a speciality meat, commonly believed to confer strength, vigour and virility on the eater. How dog is eaten Chinese food expert Fuchsia Dunlop writes: Judging by the sporadic waves of outrage about dog-eating in China, you might think it was one of the pillars of the Chinese diet. Actually, however, the consumption of dog meat is extremely marginal: it's seldom seen in markets and on restaurant menus, and most Chinese people eat it rarely, if at all. Dogs, like pigs, have been reared for their meat in China since the Neolithic age, but in modern times their flesh is regarded as a delicacy in just a few areas, such as Hunan and Guizhou. Even in these places, it tends to be eaten only occasionally, and in certain seasons. According to traditional Chinese medicine, dog is a "heating" meat which can offer a useful energy boost in midwinter, but is best avoided after the lunar new year. In culinary terms, dog meat is normally blanched or soaked before cooking to dispel the earthier, heavier aspects of its flavour. It is then, typically, made into slow-cooked soups and stews seasoned with ginger, spring onion, rice wine and spices, although it may also be roasted, or served cold as an appetiser. The tender meat of puppies is favoured over that of older dogs. In the course of many years of studying Chinese cuisine, I've only eaten dog meat on a handful of occasions. The first time, it reminded me of pork; the second, in a fiendishly spicy Hunanese stew, it recalled the taste of lamb. About 716 million pigs are slaughtered in the country every year, and 48 million cattle. The number of dogs slaughtered is far lower - one animal rights group puts the figure at about 10 million. But where do these dogs come from? According to some researchers, many are pets - like Doggie, except they have been stolen from their owners. As dogs were arriving for the dog-meat festival at Yulin in Guangxi province this week, Peter Li of Humane Society International saw no animals with quarantine inspection certificates to indicate they had been farmed. "All of them can be suspected to be stolen urban pets, rural guard dogs and stray dogs and cats," he says. A four-year inquiry into the dog-meat industry by Animals Asia also concluded that most dogs eaten in China are stolen. "During the entire investigation, we found no evidence of any large-scale breeding facilities, where 100-plus dogs were bred and raised," says the report published earlier this month. "The difficulty of large-scale breeding of dogs for food and the greed for profit give rise to stealing, snatching from the streets and even poisoning of dogs." But Li says there is mounting pressure on Chinese authorities to take action against the eating of pets - and that society is turning against the idea of eating dog altogether. There were far fewer stalls selling dog and cat meat at the Yulin festival this year than in 2014, he says. "The overall attitude is against dog eating. China has 130 million dogs, of which 27 million are urban pets. That's a big number of pet owners. "The younger generation, born in the 1990s, is not tolerant of animal cruelty." In 2014, animal rights activists intercepted 18 lorries carrying dogs intended for eating, resulting in the rescue of some 8,000 animals, he says. The Chinese media often carries stories of such rescues, in which activists force vehicles to stop and pool money to purchase the animals. He dates the rise of animal protection activism in China to 2011, the same year when, for the first time ever, more people lived in cities than the countryside. City dwellers, he says, view dogs and cats more as pets, rather than as working animals - guard dogs, for example - or sources of meat. In May, on a visit to Shanghai, I saw a sight that delighted me. While strolling on the Bund, I stopped a young tourist named Yang Yang who was carrying her tiny, fox-like dog in a sling on her chest, the way I normally carry my human baby. "Oh, this way I can take him into restaurants and on airplanes," she explained. "Otherwise, he wouldn't be allowed in with me. Where I go, he goes." All three of us posed for a photo in front of Shanghai's iconic skyline. How I wish more people had taken this attitude three decades ago. My parents, now utterly embarrassed about having allowed my pet to be cooked, generally avoid the topic entirely. But when I was five years old, my father left China to study abroad and the very first gift he sent me was a fuzzy, yellowish stuffed puppy. I named him Doggie. To this day, wherever I go, he is with me. Subscribe to the BBC News Magazine's email newsletter to get articles sent to your inbox.
The Australian actress married Cruise in 1990 after they starred together in the film Days Of Thunder. She said: "I got married very young, but it definitely wasn't power for me - it was protection. "I married for love, but being married to an extremely powerful man kept me from being sexually harassed." The couple divorced in 2001. Speaking about Hollywood's harassment scandal, Kidman said: "Of course I've had MeToo moments - since I was little! But do I want to expose them in an article? No. Do they come out in my work? Absolutely." Kidman and Cruise, who during their marriage adopted two children, Isabella, now 25, and son Connor, now 23, divorced in 2001. Kidman said her separation from Cruise forced her to "grow up". She wrote: "I would work, but I was still very much cocooned. So when I came out of it at 32, 33, it's almost like I had to grow up." Kidman married country music singer Keith Urban in 2006. The couple have two daughters together: Sunday, 10, and Faith, seven. The Oscar-winning star's films include Moulin Rouge!, The Hours, Lion, The Others and Dead Calm. Separately, Sir Michael Caine has also spoken out about the Weinstein scandal. Sir Michael, who has worked with Harvey Weinstein three times, told the Radio Times that Hollywood is a safer place following the allegations made against the producer. The actor said: "There is one great thing, if it can be described like that, about Harvey and his behaviour. It's that actresses are safe now. No producer would dare to do anything sexually."

The National Register of Citizens (NRC) is a list of people who can prove they came to the state by 24 March 1971, the day before neighbouring Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan. People left off the list will have 120 days to appeal against their exclusion. It is unclear what happens next. India says the process is needed to identify illegal Bangladeshi migrants. It has already detained thousands of people suspected of being foreigners in temporary camps which are housed in the state's prisons, but deportation is currently not an option for the country. The process has also sparked criticism of "witch hunts" against Assam's ethnic minorities. A draft version of the list published last year had four million people excluded. What is the registry of citizens? The NRC was created in 1951 to determine who was born in Assam and is therefore Indian, and who might be a migrant from neighbouring Bangladesh. The register has been updated for the first time. Families in the state have been required to provide documentation to show their lineage, with those who cannot prove their citizenship deemed illegal foreigners. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has long railed against illegal immigration in India but has made the NRC a priority in recent years. An anxious wait By Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Assam A small community centre in the village of Katajhar is being guarded by two members of the Indian army. Outside, a line of people wait. Some are clutching plastic bags containing documents. As they enter one of two rooms, an official runs his eyes down a print-out to see if their names or photos are on it. This list - the National Register of Citizens - is one with huge consequences. And so there's fear and trepidation as people here find out whether they've been included. Many here who haven't made it tell me it's a mistake as they show me paperwork they say proves they belong in this country. None of Asia Khatun's family of nine made the list. They now have the chance to appeal but there's real fear about what might come next. "I'd rather die than go to a detention centre," she tells me. People here are angry but they're also scared. Why is the registry happening in Assam? Assam is one India's most multi-ethnic states. Questions of identity and citizenship have long vexed a vast number of people living there. Among its residents are Bengali and Assamese-speaking Hindus, as well as a medley of tribespeople. A third of the state's 32 million residents are Muslims, the second-highest number after Indian-administered Kashmir. Many of them are descendants of immigrants who settled there under British rule. But illegal migration from neighbouring Bangladesh, which shares a 4,000-km long border with India, has been a concern there for decades now. The government said in 2016 that an estimated 20 million illegal immigrants were living in India. So have 1.9 million people effectively become stateless? Not quite. Residents excluded from the list can appeal to the specially formed courts called Foreigners Tribunals, as well as the high court and Supreme Court. However, a potentially long and exhaustive appeals process will mean that India's already overburdened courts will be further clogged, and poor people left off the list will struggle to raise money to fight their cases. If people lose their appeals in higher courts, they could be detained indefinitely. Some 1,000 people declared as foreigners earlier are already lodged in six detention centres located in prisons. Mr Modi's government is also building an exclusive detention centre, which can hold 3,000 detainees. "People whose names are not on the final list are really anxious about what lies ahead. One of the reasons is that the Foreigners Tribunal does not have a good reputation, and many people are worried that they will have to go through this process," Sangeeta Barooah Pisharoty, author of Assam: The Accord, The Discord, told the BBC. Why have been the courts so controversial? The special courts were first set up in 1964, and since then they have declared more than 100,000 people foreigners. They regularly identify "doubtful voters" or "illegal infiltrators" as foreigners to be deported. But the workings of the specially formed Foreigners Tribunals, which have been hearing the contested cases, have been mired in controversy. There are more than 200 such courts in Assam today, and their numbers are expected to go up to 1,000 by October. The majority of these tribunals were set up after the BJP came to power in 2014. The courts have been accused of bias and their workings have often been opaque and riddled with inconsistencies. For one thing, the burden of proof is on the accused or the alleged foreigner. For another, many families are unable to produce documents due to poor record-keeping, illiteracy or because they lack the money to file a legal claim. People have been declared foreigners by the courts because of differences in spellings of names or ages in voter rolls, and problems in getting identity documents certified by authorities. Amnesty International has described the work by the special courts as "shoddy and lackadaisical". Journalist Rohini Mohan analysed more than 500 judgements by these courts in one district and found 82% of the people on trial had been declared foreigners. She also found more Muslims had been declared foreigners, and 78% of the orders were delivered without the accused being ever heard - the police said they were "absconding", but Mohan found many of them living in their villages and unaware they had been declared foreigners. "The Foreigners Tribunal," she says, "must be made more transparent and accountable." A decorated Indian army veteran, Mohammed Sanaullah spent 11 days in a detention camp in June after being declared a "foreigner", prompting national outrage. Both the citizen's register and the tribunals have also sparked fears of a witch hunt against Assam's ethnic minorities. Have the minorities been targeted? Many say the list has nothing to do with religion, but activists see it as targeting the state's Bengali community, a large portion of whom are Muslims. They also point to the plight of Rohingya Muslims in neighbouring Bangladesh. However significant numbers of Bengali-speaking Hindus have also been left off the citizenship list, underscoring the communal and ethnic tensions in the state "One of the communities worst affected by the list are the Bengali Hindus. There are as many of them in detention camps as Muslims. This is also the reason just days before NRC is to be published the BJP has changed tack, from taking credit for it to calling it error-ridden. That is because the Bengali Hindus are a strong voter base of the BJP," says Barooah Pisharoty. The human tragedy Fearing possible loss of citizenship and detention after exclusion from the list, scores of Bengali Hindus and Muslims have killed themselves since the process to update the citizen register started in 2015, activists say. And in an echo of US President Donald Trump's policy to separate undocumented parents and children, families have been similarly broken up in Assam. Detainees have complained of poor living conditions and overcrowding in the detention centres. One detainee told a rights group after his release he had been taken to a room which had a capacity for 40 people, but was filled with around 120 people. People who have been declared foreigners as well as many inmates have been suffering from depression. Children have also been detained with their parents. Human rights activist Harsh Mander, who visited two detention centres, has spoken about a situation of "grave and extensive human distress and suffering". What happens to people who are declared foreigners? The BJP which rules the state, has insisted in the past that illegal Muslim immigrants will be deported. But neighbouring Bangladesh will definitely not accede to such a request. Many believe that India will end up creating the newest cohort of stateless people, raising the spectre of a homegrown crisis that will echo that of the Rohingya people who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh. It is not clear whether the people stripped of their Indian citizenship will be able to access welfare or own property. One possibility is that once they are released, they will be given work permits with some basic rights, but will not be allowed to vote. Read more on the NRC:
By Alice EvansBBC News Here are six things we learned from the interview. 1. He still does not regret being friends with Epstein Prince Andrew has defended his relationship with Epstein before - including as recently as August - two weeks after the disgraced financier took his own life while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. But in the BBC interview broadcast on Saturday night, the prince gave more detail about why he "still" did not regret the friendship. He said knowing Epstein had "some seriously beneficial outcomes", at a time when he had left a career in the Navy and begun one as a trade and industry special representative. Prince Andrew said: "The people that I met and the opportunities that I was given to learn, either by him or because of him, were actually very useful." 2. He met up with Epstein's ex-girlfriend this year Prince Andrew has always said he met Jeffrey Epstein in 1999 through the financier's then-girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell - a well-connected socialite. Ms Maxwell, daughter of the late newspaper tycoon, Robert Maxwell, has generally kept a low profile since claims about Epstein began to emerge. But the prince said he met up with her earlier this year, before Epstein was arrested and charged over sex trafficking allegations. "She was here (in the UK) doing some rally," the prince said. He said they did not discuss Epstein during the meet-up. "There wasn't anything to discuss about him because he wasn't in the news, you know, it was just… we had moved on." The prince stressed throughout the interview that he and Epstein "weren't that close". Invitations Epstein had received to events at Windsor Castle and at Sandringham were in the financier's capacity as Ms Maxwell's "plus one" rather than as a friend in his own right, he said. 3. His reason for meeting Epstein in 2010 was 'to put an end to the friendship' Much of the interview focused on why the prince went to stay with Epstein in 2010, following Epstein's conviction and imprisonment for soliciting and procuring a minor for prostitution. The prince said the visit was to explain to Epstein that their friendship was over. He said he had considered speaking to Epstein on the phone, but decided to meet him face-to-face "to show leadership". "I took the judgement call that because this was serious, and I felt that doing it over the telephone was the chicken's way of doing it, I had to go and see him and talk to him." 4. Being shot at in the Falklands meant he 'stopped being able to sweat' Maitlis asked the prince for his response to allegations against him made by one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Giuffre (then known as Virginia Roberts). Ms Giuffre said she met the prince in 2001 when she dined with him, danced with him at a nightclub in London, and had sex with him at Ghislaine Maxwell's house in Belgravia. Maitlis pointed out that Ms Giuffre's accusations were "very specific" and included that the prince had been "profusely sweating". The prince said a "problem" with Ms Giuffre's story was that a medical condition meant he could not have been sweating. "I didn't sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenalin in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply… it was almost impossible for me to sweat," he said. 5. How the prince likes to dress Prince Andrew revealed he had investigated the possibility that a photograph - or elements of it -provided by Ms Giuffre was fake. One reason the prince gave was his attire. "I don't believe it's a picture of me in London because... when I go out in London, I wear a suit and a tie," he said. "That's what I would describe as… those are my travelling clothes... if I'm going overseas." However, newspapers have previously pictured the prince wearing jeans without a tie or blazer on a night out in London. Speaking about the photo with Ms Giuffre, Prince Andrew told Newsnight: "Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken." He also said he did not believe the photograph "was taken in the way that has been suggested" because it shows the prince's hand on the woman's waist. "I am not one to, as it were, hug - and public displays of affection are not something that I do." 6. He has been to Pizza Express in Woking The duke said the day on which Ms Giuffre's allegations are said to have happened, 10 March 2001, he was not out in London but "at home with the children". He said he had taken his eldest daughter, Princess Beatrice, to a party at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking at about four or 5pm. "And then because the Duchess was away, we have a simple rule in the family that when one is away the other one is there." He added he remembered the occasion "weirdly distinctly" because it was one of only a couple of times that he had been to Woking, and going to the Pizza Express there was "a very unusual thing for me to do". Prince Andrew & the Epstein Scandal: The Newsnight Interview was shown on BBC Two on 16 November 2019 and can be seen on BBC iPlayer in the UK and the full interview can also be seen on YouTube.
"It's like a void, a feeling of emptiness. If you have a good piece of news or a bad piece of news, it's not having that person to tell about it. Lacking those people in your life can be really hard." Michelle Lloyd is 33 and lives in London. She is friendly and chatty and enjoys her job - she seems to have everything going for her, but she feels lonely. She has lived in a few different cities so her friends are spread around the country and tend to be busy with their children at weekends. She does go for drinks with colleagues after work, but tells me it's the deeper relationships she misses. "I'm very good at being chatty, I can talk to anyone, but that doesn't mean I'm able to have those lasting relationships with people," says Michelle. "You can be in a group and it can be intimidating because you're conscious of not letting people get to know the 'real you'. "I would say I've always had an element of feeling lonely. Ever since I was a teenager, I've always felt a little bit different and separate from large groups of friends, but in the last five years it's crept in more." Michelle has experienced anxiety and depression which she finds can amplify her loneliness because she finds it hard to articulate negative emotions. "If I'm in a group I often find myself saying 'I'm great' when people ask how I am. It's almost like an out-of-body experience because I can hear myself saying these positive things, when I'm thinking about how I struggled to get out bed yesterday. It's the loneliness of knowing how you feel in your own head and never being able to tell people." There is a common stereotype that loneliness mainly strikes older, isolated people - and of course it can, and does. But the BBC survey found even higher levels of loneliness among younger people, and this pattern was the same in every country. The survey was conducted online, which might have deterred some older people, or attracted people who feel lonely. But this is not the first study to see high rates of loneliness reported by young people: research conducted earlier in 2018 by the Office for National Statistics on paper as well as online with a smaller, but more representative sample also found more loneliness among the young. It's tempting to conclude that something about modern life is putting young people at a higher risk of loneliness, but when we asked older people in our survey about the loneliest times in their lives, they also said it was when they were young. There are several reasons why younger people might feel lonelier. The years between 16 and 24 are often a time of transition where people move home, build their identities and try to find new friends. Meanwhile, they've not had the chance to experience loneliness as something temporary, useful even, prompting us to find new friends or rekindle old friendships - 41% of people believe that loneliness can sometimes be a positive experience. Michelle has been open about her loneliness and her mental health, even blogging about them. This is not something everyone feels they can do. The survey suggested that younger people felt more able to tell others about their loneliness than older people, but still many young people who feel lonely told us they felt ashamed about it. Were older people afraid to tell us how they really felt or had they found a way of coping? The BBC loneliness experiment In February 2018 The BBC Loneliness Experiment was launched on BBC Radio 4 in collaboration with Wellcome Collection. The online survey was created by three leading academics in the field of loneliness research. But what the results do suggest is that loneliness matters at all ages. When loneliness becomes chronic it can have a serious impact on both health and well-being. To try to pin down why some feel so lonely, we looked at the differences between people. Those who told us they always or often felt lonely had lower levels of trust in others. The survey was a snapshot in time, so we can't tell where this lack of trust in others came from, but there is some evidence from previous research that if people feel chronically lonely they can become more sensitive to rejection. Imagine you start a conversation with someone in a shop and they don't respond - if you're feeling desperately lonely, then you might feel rejected and wonder if it's something about you. Michelle recognises some of this in herself. "You become quite closed off. You are dealing with so many things alone that when people do take an interest you can be quite defensive sometimes. It can be incredibly debilitating being lonely." The relationship between loneliness and spending time alone is complex - 83% of people in our study said they like being on their own. A third did say that being alone makes them feel lonely and in some cases isolation is clearly at the root of their loneliness. Jack King is 96 and lives alone in Eastbourne, on the south coast of England, after losing his wife in 2010. On his windowsill sits the tennis-ball-sized rock that hit him, leaving a hole in his forehead, when he spent more than three years as a Japanese POW during World War Two. Today, he says, the days feel very long, but to distract himself from his loneliness he fills his time writing novels and poetry, playing music and painting. "I like to keep busy. I'm creative, it's a curse," he says. It was his creativity which kept him going when he was held captive all those decades ago. He would write comic plays and perform them for the other prisoners, fashioning stage curtains out of rice sacks. After the war he was on a train which was just pulling out of the station when a young woman on the platform shouted to him that he could take her to the pictures if he liked. At first he thought she didn't mean it, but he did notice her beautiful head of hair. They did go on a date and married the same year. After 65 years of happy marriage she had a stroke, followed by another, developed dementia and eventually died. This is when his feelings of loneliness began. "Loneliness feels like a deep, deep ache," he says. "It's strange when you find the house empty - you really don't know what to do. We took delight in the simple things in life, like walks. We used to go time after time to watch the cloud shadows on the sea at Seven Sisters. And that's what I miss - that type of companionship that is so close and so intense." Jack has found some solace in his computer. Now that he's too frail to leave the house very often, he says it's opened up the world. When we examined the use of social media in the survey, we found that people who feel lonely use Facebook differently, using it more for entertainment and to connect with people. They have fewer friends who overlap with real life, and more online-only friends. Social media might heighten feelings of loneliness, but it can also help connect people. Michelle has found it both helps and hinders. "Through blogging, people have been in touch and that's great - but when I am at my lowest, going on Instagram and seeing people having these amazing lives and enjoying themselves does make you feel, 'Why can't I have that?' "I think it's really important to remember that people only put up the fun stuff," she adds. "I think we should be more honest on social media. Celebrities are trying to be a bit more honest about the less glamorous sides of their lives, but there's a long way to go." The survey also found that people who feel discriminated against for any reason - like their sexuality or a disability - were more likely to feel lonely. Megan Paul is 26. Like Jack and Michelle, she's very sociable and lively. She is blind and looks back now on a very lonely time at school, set apart by her disability and even more so by others' reactions to it. "I went to a mainstream, all-girls secondary school," says Megan. "It was OK for the first couple of years and then when girls hit their teenage years they become interested in makeup, magazines and how boys look - all quite visual things. I loved my books and animals, so I didn't have the same interests. I couldn't talk about whether boys were cute, so there was that natural growing apart." In lessons pupils would often work in pairs. When the teacher asked the whole class who wanted to work with Megan, there would be an awkward silence until eventually the teacher paired up with her. Sometimes she felt the staff set a bad example. "I would put my hand up needing help from the teacher and the teacher would ignore me or make inappropriate comments about me. Pupils learn a lot from adult role models at that age and they saw that the teachers didn't know what to do with me," Megan says. "I felt awful. My mental health was the worst it's ever been. I wanted to die rather than be at school. Then in Year 11 they agreed that I could do a lot of my work at home. I found that was much better than being stressed out at school and it taught me great study skills." Now Megan is studying for a master's degree and life has become easier, but she says that there are still aspects of her disability which can make her feel lonely. "As a blind person we can't make eye contact or use body language. If someone who can see comes into a room they will gravitate towards someone who smiles at them. I'm not smiling until I know that they are there, so they don't get any feedback from me. "The frustration is that I am confident enough to go up to people and chat, but I have to wait for people to come to me. It does mean the friends I have are really special though, because they're the kind of people who persevered. I appreciate the friends I have so much more because I don't have many of them." When Megan first got an assistance dog, knowing how many people love dogs, she wondered whether the dog might draw people in to talk to her, but she's found that's not always the case. "Being an assistance dog owner brings its own type of loneliness - a lonely-in-a-crowd scenario," she says. "If people start stroking the dog I'll use that to start a conversation, but quite a lot of people just walk off. Sometimes I feel I'm overshadowed by my dog. I know I'm not cute and furry but I do have something to offer." I asked Megan whether she has tried joining any clubs or schemes designed to alleviate loneliness. She would like to, but finds access can be a problem. "Meetups are awkward because people don't know how to approach me. I recently tried to join a walking group with my dog, but they wrote back and said I needed to find a group that walks slowly. I'm a fast walker. They should decide how fast we walk together. If I do go to a group, I'm in the corner and everyone swirls around me. But the more groups I could join, the better." As time goes on Megan has found that one solution is to turn to her phone. "As you grow, you develop coping strategies. If I feel really bad, now I drop people a message. I don't tell them I'm feeling bad, I'm just making connections and reaching out, so I can work through that feeling." With the high levels of loneliness among young people, a blog Megan wrote might be particularly useful for those with disabilities at school today. She includes tips, such as holding the door open for people in order to start a conversation. "I was so bored at school. A lot of people walked through without noticing, but even if you got a 'Thank you' or a 'Hello' at least it was an interaction. I wasn't able to go up to people and say 'Hi' because I didn't know where they were. So it's one way of getting noticed. It's nice to be seen as helpful rather than 'Here's the weird blind girl again.'" Another of Megan's tips is to talk to teachers as if they're real people, and not just your teachers. "Even as a teenager, if you're that lonely you don't care who you talk to. I remember talking to a teacher who told me her cat had had kittens. Afterwards I thought, 'That's one less break time spent alone.'" Megan says she believes not being able to see has made her kinder to others. "People with vision judge people on appearances and I don't, because I can't." It's possible that loneliness has made her kinder too. We found that people who say they often feel lonely score higher on average for social empathy. They are better at spotting when someone else is feeling rejected or excluded, probably because they have experienced it themselves. But when it comes to trust, the findings are very different. Although they may be more understanding of other people's emotional pain, on average people who say they often feel lonely had lower levels of trust in others and higher levels of anxiety, both of which can make it harder to make friends. Michelle can relate to this. "I sometimes feel that people are just being pitying by wanting to spend time with me. I do have trust issues and I think they stem from my anxiety. I think when you become lonely you do start to look inward and question people's motives. You find yourself wondering whether people spend time with me because they want to, or because they feel guilty." Sometimes it's suggested that people experiencing loneliness need to learn the social skills that would help them to make friends, but we found that people who felt lonely had social skills that were just as high as everyone else's. So instead, perhaps what's needed are strategies to help deal with the anxiety of meeting new people. Loneliness around the world Both Jack and Michelle find weekends the hardest. Michelle would like to go out for brunch, but has no-one to go with. "You can do these things on your own, but it's not as fun, because you can't try the other person's food," she says. "Nice weather makes it worse. You see people sitting outside laughing and joking and I think how I want to be part of that. "If I stay in all weekend cabin fever will set in, so I take myself off to Oxford Street and spend money I don't necessarily have. It's not the most healthy or practical way of dealing with loneliness, but it's about being around people and it's great because you can lose yourself in the crowd." So what might help? We asked people which solutions to loneliness they had found helpful. At number one was distracting yourself by dedicating time to work, study or hobbies. Next was joining a social club, but this also appeared in the list of the top three unhelpful things that other people suggest. If you feel isolated then joining a club might help, but if you find it hard to trust people, you might still feel lonely in a crowd. Number three was trying to change your thinking to make it more positive. This is easier said than done, but there are cognitive behavioural strategies which could help people to trust others. For example, if someone snubs you, you might assume it's because they don't like you, but if you ask yourself honestly what evidence you have for that, you might find there isn't any. Instead you can learn to put forward alternative explanations - that they were tired or busy or preoccupied. The next most common suggestions were to start a conversation with anyone, talk to friends and family about your feelings and to look for the good in every person you meet. People told us the most unhelpful suggestion that other people make is to go on dates. Michelle says she does feel lonelier now she's not in relationship, but knows that that meeting someone new wouldn't solve everything. "It's important to remember you can be lonely even when you're in a relationship," she says. Jack still misses his late wife desperately. I asked him whether he would consider sharing a house so that he had company, but he says he's too set in his ways. He wouldn't want to move to a residential home with other older people because then he'd lack the space to paint and write. So, too frail to leave the house, he called the charity The Silver Line, who arranged for a volunteer to phone him every Sunday for a long chat. His three children live a couple of hours away, but they all phone frequently and he has someone who comes in for two hours on weekdays to help out. All of this makes a difference, he says, but he finds it still doesn't give him the companionship he had previously. "The weekend is a dismal time," says Jack. "The time can drag. I don't have any friends because all my friends are dead. All the ladies I loved are dead. At this age nearly everybody is dead - except me. I'm still here at 96-and-a-half." I asked Jack what he thinks the solutions are. "Do what you can do. If you're mobile you can join a class or, if not, do something creative on your own. When you're painting simple watercolours you are so intent on what you're doing that you can't think about anything else." How to feel less lonely Another of the solutions suggested in the survey was to start conversations with everyone you meet. Jack does that. "It's a polite thing to do," he says. "If you can find an interest that the other person has got, it's a good way to start a conversation." Several organisations run projects to alleviate loneliness, but Michelle hasn't yet found anywhere she would be comfortable attending. "Where do you go to find friends if you're 33?" she asks. "People say, 'Get a dog.' I would love it, but it's not fair on the dog at this time in my life. Maybe exercise would be good - joining a yoga class maybe - or volunteering. I know how powerful that can be." But after blogging about her loneliness she might be finding her own solution, tailored to her interest in music. Lots of people have been getting in touch with her about going to gigs and she's thinking about whether she could start some kind of social club in London for other young people who feel lonely and like music. Michelle has also noticed that the small, kind things people do can help, and she tries to do the same herself. "On the way to work, someone smiling at you on the tube can make such a difference, especially if you've woken up feeling like the world is on your shoulders. I go and get coffee in the building where I work and the lady there is so lovely. That's my first interaction of the day. "It's just being mindful that everyone is dealing with their own stuff, so be kind. Do tiny acts of kindness." Join the conversation - find us on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.
By Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News The temperature was raised further on 13 October when China's President Xi Jinping visited a People's Liberation Army (PLA) Marine Corp base in southern Guangdong province and told the marines there to "prepare for war". In response some newspapers ran headlines suggesting an invasion is imminent. It almost certainly isn't. But there are good reasons for the urgency with which China experts are now discussing the future of Taiwan. China and the United States have long stared at each other across Taiwan. Beijing insists the island of 23 million people is China's "inviolable territory". Washington says any resolution of their long separation must be done peacefully. For decades, the uneasy stalemate has continued. Until now. Xi Jinping eyeing his legacy There are several reasons the status quo no longer looks tenable. The first is Xi Jinping. "Xi Jinping wants Taiwan back," says Professor Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at London's School of Oriental and African Studies. "And Xi Jinping wants to have Taiwan back before he hands over power to whoever comes next." Oriana Skylar Mastro, a China military analyst at Stanford University, says her wakeup call on Taiwan came when Xi Jinping forced through the abolition of presidential term limits in 2018, effectively making himself president for life. "Suddenly everything he said about Taiwan took on a whole different meaning," she says. "The timeline of when he said he wanted this issue resolved is now tied to his legitimacy as leader and his tenure as a leader." Prof Tsang says Xi Jinping views himself as a great historical figure, with a mission to complete what China's previous paramount leaders, including Mao himself, could not. "Deng Xiaoping could not get Taiwan," he explains. "Even Chairman Mao couldn't get Taiwan. And if Xi Jinping gets Taiwan, (he) is greater not only than Deng Xiaoping, but Mao Zedong." Xi Jinping has stated publicly that Taiwan reunification is an "inevitable requirement for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people". The timetable for completion of his "great rejuvenation" project is 2049, the 100th anniversary of the communist revolution. That is nearly 30 years away. But there is reason to think Xi is in more of a hurry. China's growing military might The first is that China may soon have the military capability to defeat the United States in a war over Taiwan. "For the past 20 years, the main question that most people ask is, will the United States defend its allies and partners?" says Ms Mastro. "It was a question of resolve. Will the United States come to Taiwan's aid? But as the Chinese military becomes more advanced, the question has shifted from will they, to can they?" The transformation of China's military from a low-tech "People's Army" to a modern high-tech military, has happened much faster than many had predicted. The speed and scale of the change was brought home during the huge 70th anniversary parade in Beijing on 1 October last year. Among the familiar paraphernalia of tanks, artillery and rocket launchers were some very striking new weapons systems, including stealth jets and stealth drones, and so-called "hypersonic glide vehicles". These new systems are designed to strike at US aircraft carrier battle groups, should they try to intervene to protect Taiwan. Captain James E. Fanell was the director of US Naval Intelligence for the US Pacific fleet until his retirement in 2015. "I've characterised what I called a decade of concern," he tells me from his new job at the Geneva Centre for Security Policy, "which is right now 2020 to 2030, which I think is the most dangerous time. Both (former President) Hu Jintao and Xi (Jinping) ordered the PLA to have the capability to be able to take Taiwan militarily by about 2020. "So, they've been working for the last 20 years on orders to have the capacity and capabilities to launch a military invasion against Taiwan." America's 'failure' in the South China Sea China has also been gradually testing America's resolve, seeing how far it can go before the US responds to threats against an ally. According to Capt Fanell, the US has repeatedly failed those tests, allowing China to take control of Scarborough Shoal off the coast of the Philippines in 2012, and then doing nothing to stop China building a series of huge new artificial island bases across the South China Sea. "What happened at Scarborough Shoal from April to June 2012 is America's biggest foreign policy failure in Asia since our helicopters took off from the roofs of those embassy buildings in Saigon in 1975," he says, referring to the US military defeat in the Vietnam War. "It was a disaster and it really had a debilitating impact on America's national credibility in Asia when we didn't do anything to defend the Philippines." Taiwan is not only about getting back China's so-called "lost territories". Control of the island would give Beijing what General Douglas MacArthur once called an "unsinkable aircraft carrier in the Pacific". Ms Mastro says a Chinese victory over Taiwan would completely re-draw the strategic map of Asia. "If China does fight a war over Taiwan and wins, not only do they get to reunify with Taiwan, but that's basically the end of the role of the United States as a leader in Asia as we know it," she explains. "So, there are many benefits, actually, from the Chinese perspective." In Washington there is now bipartisan recognition that the threat to Taiwan is growing. In a clear signal to China, the Trump administration has approved billions in arms sales to Taiwan, including, for the first time, advanced air-to-ground missiles. The risk of miscalculating the US military But it is still far from clear what the United States would do if Taiwan were attacked. Capt Fanell says that is a mistake. "We know from history, we know the lack of support to the Kuwaiti government indicated to Saddam that he had a free rein to go into Kuwait," he explains. "We know from the Korean War, statements that were equivocal gave China and Russia this idea that it was OK to attack in the Korean peninsula. If we don't make some definitive statements about who our friends and allies are and what lengths we'll go to defend them, then we leave them at risk." But Prof Tsang says there is also a lesson for Xi Jinping from those past conflicts. Belatedly, America did come to the aid of the Republic of Korea, and Kuwait. He says China would do well not to underestimate US military resolve once provoked. "The spirit of the United States military is one that will fight and fight and fight," he explains. "If the Chinese take that into account, I think they may be a bit more cautious in their calculations and the risk of miscalculation may be reduced." If you add anger and suspicion over Covid-19 to the trade war, the Huawei investigation, the mutual closing of consulates and the ejection of journalists, relations between Washington and Beijing are at their lowest since the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. There are voices on both sides calling on the next US president to drop the hostility and return to engagement with China. But the consensus among those I have spoken to is that the old type of engagement has failed. They say the next US president must find a new type of engagement, more honest, more robust, and where the US is much clearer about its obligations and intentions, towards its allies in Asia, including Taiwan.
The divorce papers were filed at the New York State Supreme Court. The couple, married in 1999 aboard a private yacht in New York, have two daughters together, Grace and Chloe. In 2011, Ms Deng famously leapt to her husband's defence to slap a protester who threw a pie at him as British MPs quizzed him over phone-hacking. Mr Murdoch, 82, met his Chinese-born third wife in 1997 at a cocktail party in Hong Kong. They were married two years later, weeks after his second divorce. Pre-nup Ms Deng, 44, is 38 years younger than the Australian-born media mogul, who is said by Forbes to be worth $9.4bn (£6bn). "I can confirm for the record that Rupert filed in New York State Supreme Court this morning for divorce," Murdoch spokesman Steven Rubenstein told AFP news agency on Thursday. The BBC's Robert Peston says the couple had a pre-nuptial agreement and have held shares in trust for their children. So our business editor believes the divorce is not likely to lessen the magnate's grip on his media empire. Mr Murdoch, now a US citizen, reportedly paid $1.7bn in his divorce settlement from his last wife. Ms Deng, said to be the daughter of a factory director, was born in 1968 and grew up in the eastern Chinese city of Xuzhou before leaving for the US at 19 to study. She worked in a Chinese restaurant in California before going on to graduate from Yale University in 1996. Ms Deng was later employed by Star TV, News Corp's Asian satellite-television operation in Hong Kong, where she met Mr Murdoch during one of his visits. The divorce filing comes two days before News Corp is to be split into two companies, one for its entertainment assets and the other for its publishing business. Mr Murdoch is to be chairman of both firms. His global media portfolio includes the Wall Street Journal, television channels such as Fox News and Sky, and the 20th Century Fox movie studio. Two years ago, his UK newspaper division became embroiled in a phone-hacking scandal, which led Mr Murdoch to close one of the titles, the News of the World. In July 2011, Ms Deng jumped from her seat during a UK parliamentary hearing to slap a prankster who tried to shove a shaving-cream pie into Mr Murdoch's face.
By Eleanor LawrieTechnology of Business reporter A bit steep, you might think, for a picture of someone you've never heard of. And you won't have heard of the artist either, as the picture was created by an algorithm drawing on a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th Centuries. And to be honest, it's a bit rubbish. The sale, which astonished auction house Christie's, raised many important questions. Can a computer, devoid of human emotion, ever be truly creative? Is this portrait really art? Does any of that matter if people are prepared to pay for it? And as artificial intelligence evolves and eventually perhaps reaches or surpasses human level intelligence, what will this mean for human artists and the creative industries in general? Algorithms have already created artworks, poems, and pieces of music, but are they merely mimicking rather than creating? Cognitive neuroscientist Romy Lorenz says a lot depends on how we define creativity. If creativity means finding completely new ways to solve problems, then AI has already achieved that, she argues, citing Google's DeepMind subsidiary. In 2017, one of DeepMind's AI programmes beat the world's number one player of Go, an ancient and highly complex Chinese board game, after apparently mastering creative new moves and innovative strategies within days. "Google would say that was creativity - new ways of finding solutions that it was not taught," she says. But is art more than just creative problem-solving? More Technology of Business Games, particularly those which take place within virtual worlds, have been the perfect setting for AI to solve problems creatively. But asking an algorithm to create without any human input at all actually yields quite boring results, argues New York-based professor of computer science, Julian Togelius. He cites Kate Compton's "10,000 bowls of oatmeal" problem, which suggests that while algorithms can now create infinite worlds, these can be tedious for humans to play in. An example, he suggests, was the hotly-anticipated release of space exploration game No Man's Sky, which offered 18 quintillion algorithmically-generated planets to explore. "In No Man's Sky there are more places you could visit in a lifetime, with different flora and fauna. But that game has had mixed reviews - it's a technical masterpiece but it's not super interesting to play," he says. "The question is, can your algorithm generate a world that has meaning to it, and that is particular to the player in terms of place or skill? "These algorithms are amazing - they can do more and more. But there will always be things us humans want to put in. It's the power of the sensibility and intentionality of the human brain - that's what is hard [to recreate]." Dr Lorenz points out that true artistic creativity differs from creative problem solving in that it requires a shift in perspective that machines do not appear to have the capacity for. "Artistic creativity is about turning an introspective thought into a medium, whether it's a sculpture or a piece of music. It's about taking an abstract form and making it concrete. "But AI has no internal world and it has no need to create its desires or fears." So rather than letting AI take complete control, results seem to be far more fruitful when human artists work hand-in-hand with machines. Musician and University of Sussex lecturer Dr Alice Eldridge suggests that we should treat AI as "just another tool that we have designed, like the wheel, or the combustion engine". She has helped create a cello that uses a combination of acoustics, electrification and an adaptive algorithm that makes the instrument self-resonate; or essentially, play itself. "With a classical cello you have to bring the instrument alive with a bow; a feedback cello is already singing, your job as a performer is to shape the sound - it's more like a dance than 'controlling' an instrument in the traditional way," she says. "This creates a different way of thinking about, and designing our relationships with, musical instruments, and technology in general." Mick Grierson, at the UAL Creative Computing Institute in London, believes advances in AI will "lead to better art, new types of artists and new mediums". In 2016, Nordic band Sigur Rós used his software to create a constantly evolving version of one of their singles, which the band played on a 24-hour road trip around Iceland. Individual musical elements of the song were fed through the software to make a song that, like a live performance, is subtly different with every repetition, and could respond to external prompts. Innovative composer and producer Brian Eno, who has worked with Roxy Music, David Bowie and Coldplay amongst others, is also a big fan of using algorithms to create music that constantly changes. Prof Grierson has also worked with Massive Attack on an AI reworking of their Mezzanine album, to mark its 20th anniversary. The album will be fed into a form of AI that teaches itself - a neural network - and visitors to an upcoming Barbican exhibition will be able to affect the resulting sound by their movements.

Shares in Microsoft, criticised for its slow response to the booming market for mobile devices, leapt 7.3% on the news. Mr Ballmer, who last month unveiled a restructuring to address the criticism, said in a statement: "There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time. "We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction." The world's biggest software company has created a special committee to find a replacement. This committee includes Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Mr Ballmer, 57, succeeded Mr Gates in 2000. The two men met in 1973 while studying at Harvard University, and Mr Ballmer joined the company in 1980. 'Single strategy' Microsoft emerged as the undisputed leader in the technology sector, and became the world's largest company by market value. But the company had been criticised by investors recently for not reacting quickly enough to the way Apple and Google have led the way in mobile devices. Microsoft struggled as consumers began to shun desktops and laptops in favour of tablets and mobile devices. While its Windows software is used on the vast majority of PCs, Microsoft made little impact in the fast-growing tablet and smartphone segments. Microsoft's transformation plan, announced last month, is trying to address that. In a memo to staff last month, Mr Ballmer said that the changes meant the company was "rallying behind a single strategy as one company - not a collection of divisional strategies". The aim, he said, was to react faster to changes in the market. Andrew Bartels, analyst at Forrester Research, said Mr Ballmer has been rightly criticised for being "caught flatfooted by the shift to tablets". But he added that he should get big credit for successful products such as the Xbox and Bing. 'Surprise' "The problem for Microsoft is its revenue primarily comes from sales to business. It should be viewed more like IBM, but is viewed as consumer, like Apple," he said. Mr Ballmer's planned departure comes shortly after activist investing fund ValueAct Capital Management took a small stake in the company, and started agitating for a change in strategy and a clear succession plan. Despite the recent criticism, the timing of his decision to go surprised analysts. "Yes, this was a surprise, especially considering how close it is to the recently announced strategic overhaul towards devices and services," said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen. Born in 1956, Mr Ballmer grew up near Detroit, where his father worked as a manager at the Ford motor company. Having graduated from Harvard with a degree in mathematics and economics, he worked for two years at Procter & Gamble as an assistant product manager and attended Stanford University Graduate School of Business before joining Microsoft. The company has more than tripled revenues and doubled profits under Mr Ballmer's leadership.
By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The iPhone X - which is referred to as "ten" - uses a facial recognition system to recognise its owner rather than a fingerprint-based one. Apple said FaceID can work in the dark by using 30,000 infra-red dots to check an identity, and was harder to fool than its old TouchID system. It is Apple's most expensive phone yet. A 64 gigabyte capacity model will cost $999 (£999 in the UK) when it goes on sale on 3 November. A 256GB version will be priced at $1,149 (£1,149 in the UK). By contrast, Samsung is charging $930 (£869 in the UK) for its new Note 8 phone, which has 64GB of storage. "The iPhone X is a long-term investment by Apple that sets a template for the next generation of iPhone hardware," commented Geoff Blaber from the CCS Insight consultancy. "An OLED [organic light-emitting diode] display and the new design is likely to be standard on future iPhone models, but Apple must first tackle the challenge of obtaining sufficient supplies." Apple said the switch to an OLED display would help the phone produce "true blacks" and more accurate colours than before. LG and Samsung already use similar tech on their handsets. Prior to the launch, Apple's most expensive phone was an iPhone 7 Plus that cost $969 (£919 in the UK). One expert commented that Apple's ability to get consumers to spend more on its smartphones than rivals' was "legendary". "There may be an element of high pricing to constrain demand and make things match up with how many they can produce," said Neil Mawston from Strategy Analytics. "But I suspect Apple always had a $1,000 iPhone in mind - we had seen the price creep up year after year, and there's a lot of pressure from shareholders for the company to hit a $1tn valuation. "Bumping up the prices on their number one product is one way of doing that." Facial recognition Apple acknowledged that users might have concerns about using facial recognition to verify purchases via Apple Pay or to access their device. But it claimed that while there was a one-in-50,000 chance that TouchID could be unlocked by a random stranger, the odds rose to one-in-one-million with FaceID. Nevertheless, one expert said users might still be concerned the handset had no fingerprint sensor as an alternative. "This is the steepest hurdle that they have," commented Carolina Milanesi from market research firm Creative Strategies. "A lot of consumers will be a little bit reluctant to use facial recognition as an ID system until Apple has proven that it is safe and works all the time. "In the eyes of consumers TouchID wasn't broken - so they may ask why Apple is trying to fix it." Other features announced about the handset included: Analysis By Dave Lee, North America technology correspondent It's the big(ger) leap that iPhone fans - and Wall Street - had been demanding. The iPhone X brings together many features we'd been expecting - such as FaceID for unlocking the phone, and animated emojis - animojis - that look fun to play with, if not a killer feature that will have people running to stores. All this won't come cheap: at $999+ it's the most expensive iPhone to date. Apple is often accused of being slow to new tech, and I think that criticism will continue. Wireless charging comes years after Samsung first introduced it, for example, and the overall look of the phone - which no longer has the iconic home button - looks strikingly similar to the latest Samsung Galaxy Note. The phone was unveiled in the new Steve Jobs Theater, a purpose-built venue for such launches. A beautiful, comfy building, with marble everywhere, it sits alongside Apple's striking new spaceship campus. This is the house that iPhone built, with a decade of phenomenal success. Does iPhone X herald another great era? The audience here cheered, but didn't stand, with applause. I'm reserving my judgement until I've tried it. The iPhone X also adds support for wireless charging. "Apple chose Qi wireless charging," noted Ian Fogg, from the IHS Markit consultancy. "It was the right decision to use a standard because Apple users will benefit from widely available charge pads." The feature was also introduced to the new iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus models, which were introduced earlier at the event. The lower-end 4.7in and 5.5in devices are distinguished from their predecessors by having: The iPhone 8 ranges from $699 to $849 and the iPhone 8 Plus from $799 to $949. They will cost the same amounts in Sterling and go on sale on 22 September. Mixed reality The new models coincide with the release of iOS 11 - the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. It introduces ARKit - software development tools that make it easier for developers to add augmented reality features to their apps, in which graphics are mixed together with real-world views. Marketing chief Phil Schiller showed off one app that - if used by spectators at a sports stadium - would show real-time stats hovering over the live action. Another demo involved the Machines, a multiplayer robot-battle game that can be played over views of close-by table tops and other surfaces. The facility will not work on the iPhone 6 or older devices, so may provide a means to convince owners of ageing Apple kit to upgrade. "When Apple first introduced the iPhone users were unsure about how touchscreens would benefit them, but now we know that they're a great way to use a device," said Brian Blau, a tech industry analyst at Gartner. "The same thing will happen with augmented reality - it's as important as touch, if not more. "Developers have new opportunities and I think they will embrace them, but just as with touch it took them years to perfect those experiences, I also think that will also happen with AR." Apple also unveiled a version of its smartwatch with its own 4G link. The innovation means that the Watch Series 3 can receive phone calls, access internet services and stream music without being linked to an iPhone. Users will, however, face an additional monthly charge for the benefit. Apple recently overtook Fitbit to become the world's joint-top wearable tech-maker alongside Xiaomi, according to one study. Other companies - including LG and Samsung - have previously sold smartwatches with in-built cellular capabilities, but battery-life restrictions and other issues limited interest. "Apple's ability in the past to generate new markets when others thought they were dead is legendary," commented Mr Mawston. "For people like joggers, runners and cyclists who possibly want to do hardcore sports outdoors without carrying two devices, an LTE Apple Watch could be something of a blessing." The latest version of the Watch's operating system - which will also be available to earlier models - will include new heart monitor functions. It will warn owners if their heart rate becomes elevated when they are not active or if its rhythm becomes irregular, to flag the possibility of disease. The 4G Apple Watch will cost $399 (£300) and be released on 22 September. 4K movies Apple also announced a fresh version of its TV set-top box, which now supports 4K video and high dynamic range (HDR) content. In one of the few details not to have leaked in advance, Apple revealed it had struck a deal with several of the major movie studios to ensure that films in the higher-resolution, richer-colour formats would not cost more than their high-definition (HD) equivalents. Users' existing iTunes movie libraries will also be upgraded without charge. HDR 4K movies have already been available to rent or buy from services including Amazon, but they tended to be sold at much higher prices than lower-quality formats.
It said UK growth had gained momentum through the first half of the year. The forecast came as a survey indicated that activity in the UK construction sector grew at its fastest pace for nearly six years in August. On Monday, a similar survey had shown strong growth in the manufacturing sector. Recent data and surveys have pointed to an acceleration in the UK's economic recovery. 'Impressive' performance The OECD's UK growth forecast came as part of its latest assessment of global prospects. The body said that global growth was set to remain sluggish, as problems in emerging economies offset improving recoveries in some advanced economies. However, it cited the UK, North America and Japan as places where activity was expanding at "encouraging rates". Also on Tuesday there was an upbeat report on the UK building industry. The latest Markit/CIPS purchasing managers' index (PMI) for the UK's construction industry indicated further improvement in the sector, with residential building leading the way. The PMI reading rose to 59.1 in August, up from 57.0 in July and the highest reading since September 2007. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. "The latest construction PMI figures are yet another indication that the UK economy has performed impressively over the summer months," said Tim Moore, senior economist at Markit. "A steep upturn in civil engineering activity suggested that public sector demand has joined residential building as a key driver of construction output growth during August." On Monday, the PMI survey for the manufacturing sector found the strongest growth in activity for two and a half years, with output and new orders rising at their fastest rate for 19 years.
Gilles de Kerchove also warned that Western air strikes would increase the risk of retaliatory attacks in Europe. US-led forces have launched more than 200 air strikes against Islamic State (IS) militants in Iraq since August and on Monday began targeting IS in Syria. The UK parliament is due to vote on possible air strikes in Iraq on Friday. IS - also known as Isil or Isis - has seized large parts of Iraq and Syria in recent months. Mr de Kerchove said the number of 3,000 included all those who have been to the region, including those who have returned and those who have been killed there. The CIA estimates that IS may have up to 31,000 fighters in Iraq and Syria - three times as many as previously feared. Mr de Kerchove said that Islamic State's declaration of a caliphate in June may have played a role in drawing more support from Europe. "If you believe in this, probably you want to be part of it as early as possible," he said. He warned that air strikes by the US and its Western allies had increased the risk of a violent response from militant Islamists against European targets. "That was clear with the French because three days ago [IS] issued a statement saying there would be retaliation against the coalition. A French man was kidnapped in Algeria and he has been beheaded. So they did what they announced," he said. Where do Islamic State's foreign fighters come from? Mr de Kerchove also warned that groups competing with IS, such as al-Qaeda, may try to launch attacks in Europe to maintain their profile. "The rise of [IS] may prompt al-Qaeda to do something to show that it is still relevant," he said. Suspects arrested On Friday, Spain's interior ministry said Spanish and Moroccan police had arrested nine people suspected of belonging to a militant cell linked to the IS group. A statement from the ministry said the suspects belonged to a group based in the Spanish enclave of Melilla, on the northern coast of Africa, and the neighbouring town of Nador, in Morocco. One of those arrested is reported to be Spanish; the rest are Moroccan nationals. Earlier this week, the UN Security Council adopted a binding resolution compelling states to prevent their nationals from joining jihadists in Iraq and Syria. The US military released footage of air strikes on IS-controlled oil refineries in eastern Syria on Thursday, carried out by US, Saudi and UAE aircraft. Sales of smuggled crude oil have helped finance the jihadists' offensive in both countries. Three new strikes targeting IS positions in Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria were confirmed by the US on Friday morning. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict in Syria, said the new strikes caused casualties but the numbers were unclear. Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said the purpose of Thursday's strikes was "not necessarily to kill militants" but to destroy the oil facilities, which were funding IS through the black market. He said the strikes had been effective but not yet decisive, adding that IS militants "still have financing at their fingertips". He said it was too soon to talk of "winning" against IS, adding that they still "have plenty of weapons and vehicles and the ability to move around". UK votes on action The US says more than 40 countries have offered to join the anti-IS coalition. The Danish government announced on Friday it would be joining the military operations against IS - but only in Iraq. Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said the move needed to be approved in a vote in Denmark's parliament, but said it was considered a formality. No date was given for the vote. She told reporters the deployment would consist of seven F-16 fighter jets - four operational planes and three in reserve - along with 250 pilots and support staff. MPs in the UK are currently debating joining the air strikes on IS in Iraq. The office of Prime Minister David Cameron said UK forces could legally join the bombing of targets in Iraq after the Iraqi minister of foreign affairs wrote to the UN seeking international assistance. Mr Cameron told the UN on Wednesday IS was an "evil against which the whole world must unite". The Australian Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, says his government will decide in the coming days whether to join the air strikes in Iraq and Syria. Mr Abbott said it was in Australia's interest to play its part in what he called the fight "against the murderous death cult". Who are Islamic State (IS)?
The writer brought a legal action against Chris Gossage, a partner at Russells Solicitors, and his friend, Judith Callegari. Rowling was revealed as the writer of crime novel The Cuckoo's Calling in a Sunday Times article. The author had published the book under the pen name Robert Galbraith. Rowling's solicitor told Mr Justice Tugendhat that Russells had contacted the writer's agent after the story was published, revealing it was Mr Gossage who had divulged the confidential information to Ms Callegari. Ms Callegari then revealed the information in the course of a Twitter exchange with a journalist. The court heard Rowling had been "left dismayed and distressed by such a fundamental betrayal of trust". Mr Gossage, Ms Callegari and Russells all apologised and the firm agreed to pay the author's legal costs. It also agreed to make a payment, by way of damages, to The Soldiers' Charity, formerly known as the Army Benevolent Fund. Rowling explained that she was donating the money "partly as a thank you to the army people" who helped her with research. "But also because writing a hero who is a veteran has given me an even greater appreciation and understanding of exactly how much this charity does for ex-servicemen and their families, and how much that support is needed," she said. 'Extraordinary generosity' The Cuckoo's Calling, about a war veteran turned private investigator called Cormoran Strike, had sold 1,500 copies before it was revealed that Rowling was its author. Within hours, the novel rose more than 5,000 places to top Amazon's sales list. Rowling said she would be donating all the royalties for the book to The Soldiers' Charity. She said she had "always intended" to give the charity "a donation out of Robert's royalties" but "had not anticipated him making the bestseller list a mere three months after publication". Major General Martin Rutledge, chief executive of ABF The Soldiers' Charity, said they were "absolutely thrilled" by the author's "extraordinary generosity". "This donation will make a huge difference to the lives of thousands of soldiers, former soldiers and their families who are in real need. "Her tremendous show of support for The Soldiers' Charity will help to remind people of the many sacrifices made by our soldiers, long after any news of Afghanistan has left the front page."
Kim Jong-un put on quite a show to mark the 105th anniversary of the birth of his grandfather Kim Il-sung, North Korea's founding leader. More new hardware was on display than ever before, including new inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). To its domestic audience, it was a demonstration of technological might and prosperity. To outsiders it was a threat: be you near or far you will eventually be in range. The Kim Jong-un years have seen increasingly frequent missile tests, all defying UN sanctions, but have they made any difference to the North's capabilities? The birth of North Korea's missile programme North Korea's ballistic missile programme grew out of one of the most widely proliferated missiles of all time: the Scud. In 1979, then Egyptian President Anwar Sadat transferred a small number of the Soviet missiles to North Korea as part of a broader agreement to co-operate on missile technology. North Korea then reverse-engineered the Scud and began producing and testing their own missiles, called Hwasong-6 and Hwasong-7. In time, they extended the range of the Scud and elongated the body to create a missile called the Nodong. Eventually, North Korea began clustering those Nodong engines to create a staged space launch vehicle called the Unha-3, a rocket capable of carrying a payload outside the earth's atmosphere. While the Scud family of missiles is not advanced, the missiles are reliable and relatively cheap to produce. The Nodong is nuclear-capable, and North Korea even exported it to Pakistan and Iran. But there were other advances to be made. Making missiles that can easily be hidden More recently, North Korea reverse-engineered the Soviet R-27 submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) into a road-mobile missile that could hit US forces in Guam. The missile, known as the Musudan, was displayed on military parades for years, but North Korea only started testing it in 2016. After six Musudan tests, there has only been one notable success, in June 2016. But the incremental changes between each test are interesting to note. For example, after one of the failures damaged the transporter erector launcher (TEL) truck badly, North Korea sent out the next TEL with shielding over its wheels and chassis. And, yes, this missile is probably nuclear-capable. Nearly all of North Korea's missiles are road mobile. This means North Korea can keep the missiles continuously moving around the country on TELs. These trucks can be hidden in tunnels, warehouses, bunkers and caves. Constantly moving them and hiding them makes them harder to detect. Missiles that can be launched from water 2016 was also an important year for submarine-launched ballistic missiles. After disastrous failures in 2015, North Korea began to make some progress on a missile known as the Pukguksong. Using an underwater platform, North Korean engineers were previously able to achieve successful ejection of the missile but could not get the stage to light or achieve much range. After a test of a solid- (rather than liquid-) fuelled engine in April 2016, North Korea began to have increasingly successful SLBM tests. These SLBMs are not nearly as worrying as the SLBMs that the US, Russia or China possess. They will remain unreliable unless testing continues. North Korea's submarines are also loud and easy to detect. So in many ways these missiles are more for domestic "prestige" than military use. That being said, satellite imagery shows that North Korea is investing a lot in overhauling the submarine shipyard at Sinpo. So this is just the beginning of its programme. The KN-17 (a label assigned by the US) shown in the most recent parade is also being tested near Sinpo. This land-based anti-ship ballistic missile has had two failures so far, but its message is that US, South Korean and Japanese ships should beware. Missiles that use solid fuel In February 2017, North Korea tested a land-based version of its solid-fuelled SLBM, called the Pukguksong-2, launching it from a canister on the back of a TEL. North Korea traditionally relied on the same liquid fuel that Scuds used. This fuel is reliable and cheap, but it is corrosive and cannot be stored in the missile. This means that missile convoys have to travel with fuel and oxidizer trucks, making them larger and easier to spot from satellites. It also means the missile cannot be moved or stored while fuelled, so the launch process takes longer. A truck will pull out of a tunnel, for example, erect the missile, the unit will fuel it and target it, and then launch. However, solid fuel can generally be stored in the missile, shaving valuable time off a launch in a war scenario. The parade showed that North Korea is committed to solid fuel by showing off two new possible solid fuel ICBMs in canisters. The canisters may have been empty (why load a missile if nobody's going to see it?), but it's likely that this is a design concept that will evolve over several parades and component tests. Developments since the start of 2016 have shown that North Korea is focusing not just on new missile technologies, but also on the actual deployment of the missile in the field. In September 2016, North Korea launched a volley of three ballistic missiles. In March 2017, they launched four more. The simultaneous launch of several missiles means tracking and intercepting them is harder, and that also poses a challenge to Thaad, the controversial new ballistic missile defence system being deployed in South Korea. So does North Korea have a long range missile? The question that seems to fascinate Americans the most is whether North Korea can deploy a missile to reach US shores. The main reason to have an ICBM is for a nuclear strike. There is little point in putting a conventional weapon on such a missile. North Korea has paraded ICBMs since 2012, when they revealed not only a missile known as the KN-08, but an illicitly-procured Chinese truck as a TEL. The missiles were initially criticised as "fakes" but over time, improvements made them credible. The latest parade appeared to show two different solid fuel ICBMs in addition to a dramatically altered KN-08. Outsiders have dismissed North Korea's ability for decades but should probably pay attention to a few key developments. In 2015, North Korea responded by introducing an ICBM known as the KN-14. In 2016, its propaganda featured images and video of essentially all the components one would need for an ICBM. First, North Korea released photos of Kim Jong-un standing between a KN-08 ICBM and a purported nuclear warhead that would fit in it. Second, North Korea simulated a heat shield test for a re-entry vehicle the same month - a key stage that distinguishes a space launch vehicle from an ICBM. An ICBM leaves the Earth's atmosphere like a space launch vehicle but must return a warhead back through the atmosphere intact, so simulation helps make sure it can withstand the heat and pressure of re-entry. In addition, North Korean engineers tested a remarkable re-engineering of the Soviet R-27 engine in order to double it and indications are that it has jumped to a more "energetic" fuel. That engine test in April 2016 showed a translucent pink-purple flame rather than the yellow flame analysts are used to seeing from Scud-based engines. If the flame colour does indicate more energetic fuel, then this ICBM puts not just Alaska and Hawaii at risk, but London and Washington DC too - by using a better fuel they can throw more weight farther. So when will North Korea actually test an ICBM? The answer to that is, when it is good and ready to. The two new solid fuel ICBMs seen on the parade are years away from testing. But high-level UK embassy defector Thae Yong-ho said Pyongyang aims to complete the development of one ICBM by the end of 2017 or early 2018. Testing and "completing" are two different things. It seems likely North Korea will test the liquid fuelled KN-08 ICBM in this time frame since it is apparently closest to completion. But it is also likely that it will fail multiple times before it can be deployed.

Companies like Disney routinely agreed to censor films while Google, Yahoo, Microsoft and Apple were "all too willing" to work with Beijing, he said. Such actions risked undermining the liberal world order, Mr Barr added. His intervention is the latest criticism of China by White House and other US officials. Tensions between the US and China have been rising over a host of issues. The US this week removed Hong Kong's preferential trade status, after China brought in a controversial new security law for the territory. President Donald Trump has also criticised China over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic as well as its military build-up in the South China Sea, its treatment of Muslim minorities, and massive trade surpluses. China has rejected all foreign criticism of its actions. On Friday, in response to the latest allegations, its foreign ministry said US officials had "lost their minds and gone mad". What did Barr say about US firms? Speaking at the Gerald Ford Presidential Museum, he warned that dependence on China for certain goods risked making the US vulnerable and said US firms were giving up secrets and compromising values under Chinese pressure. "If Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive," he said. The justice department had seen growing numbers of cases where Chinese officials were lobbying US bosses to favour Beijing's policies, he said. He urged US firms to defy Chinese demands, saying: "If individual companies are afraid to take a stand, there is strength in numbers." He criticised technology companies, which he said had "allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence". He also alleged - without providing evidence - that the Chinese government was able to access Apple phones while the company had denied similar access to the US government, and that this was emblematic of a "double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies". "Do you think when Apple sells phones in China, that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities? They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities," he said. Apple says it does not have a back door into its phones and will not build one. Mr Barr also praised Facebook, Google, Twitter, and LinkedIn for saying they would not comply with requests for user data under Beijing's new security law in Hong Kong. ... and about China? China's actions showed it did not want to join other industrialised economies but rather wanted to replace them entirely, he said. Beijing sought to exploit the "power, productivity and ingenuity" of China's people to "overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship". China was engaged in an "economic blitzkrieg" to "seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world's preeminent superpower", he added. 'A key pillar of Trump's re-election strategy' Zhaoyin Feng, BBC Chinese, Washington DC The Trump administration has long argued that China is taking advantage of America in trade. Mr Barr's remarks ramp up the accusation, alleging that China's ultimate goal in doing business with the US is to replace it and to become a world superpower. "Win-win in China means China wins twice," he said. Mr Barr's remarks are among a series of hard-hitting speeches by senior US officials on China, including FBI Director Christopher Wray and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expected to follow. All advocating for a tougher stance against Beijing, some of these speeches were delivered in key swing states like Michigan and Arizona. Two days ago, President Trump voiced a range of grievances against China during a Rose Garden press conference, which quickly turned into an hour-long monologue attacking his Democratic rival Joe Biden. Campaign rhetoric and voices advocating for more hawkish policies towards China have become indistinguishable, as Mr Trump seems determined to make China a key pillar of his re-election strategy. What does China say? On Friday, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry said the country had no intention of replacing or challenging the US. Hua Chunying also said officials in Washington criticised China to distract from domestic issues. "These people, for self-interest and political gain, do not hesitate to hijack domestic public opinion... to the point where they have lost their minds and gone mad," she said. And on Thursday, the foreign ministry accused the White House of unfairly targeting China. "We know that some in the US are oppressing China and bullying China. As an independent sovereign state, China must respond to the bullying practices and we must say no, we must... take reactive moves to it," Ms Hua said. She also responded to media reports that the US could ban Chinese Communist Party members from visiting the US, which she said were "utterly pathetic" if true. The Communist Party is the country's sole, ruling political party. About 7% of the population are members of the party - loyal membership is essential for those who want to climb the career ladder - and members include e-commerce giant Alibaba's Jack Ma, telecomm company Huawei's founder Ren Zhengfei and actress Fan Bingbing. What else have US officials been saying? Mr Barr's speech follows similar warnings about the impact of Chinese activity on the US by other US officials. Earlier this month FBI director Christopher Wray said acts of espionage and theft by China's government pose the "greatest long-term threat" to the future of the US. He said China had begun targeting Chinese nationals living abroad, coercing their return, and was working to compromise US coronavirus research. "China is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to become the world's only superpower by any means necessary," Mr Wray added.
But the firm, which manufactures a range of technology, from network equipment to mobile phones, is on the agenda for other reasons, too. Several governments around the world have blocked telecoms companies from using Huawei gear in next-generation 5G mobile networks, citing security concerns. So far the UK has held back from any formal ban. So why is the company proving so controversial? What is 5G? Fifth-generation mobile broadband is coming over the next year or so, promising download and browsing speeds 10 to 20 times faster than those today's 4G networks can offer. This superfast mobile connectivity means you might be able to livestream a high-definition film to your phone, say, or enjoy much higher quality augmented and virtual reality experiences while you're out and about. It will also power the "internet of things", enabling connected machines, from traffic lights to driverless cars, to communicate with each other. What is Huawei? The company started out making equipment for mobile phone networks and has grown rapidly, eclipsing the likes of Nokia and Ericsson, to become a global leader. More recently it has started making smartphones as well, and Huawei has now captured about 16% of the global market, making it the world's third-largest supplier after Samsung and Apple. The firm's founder Ren Zhengfei, a former People's Liberation Army officer, started Huawei in 1987. It's based in Shenzhen, Guangdong, and is owned by 80,000 of its 180,000 employees. So is Huawei a security threat? The US points to Mr Ren's military background and its growing global role to argue it represents a risk to national security. In principle, controlling the technology that sits at the heart of vital communications networks gives Huawei the capacity to conduct espionage or disrupt communications during any future dispute, particularly as more things, from autonomous vehicles to domestic appliances, become connected to the internet. Countries using Huawei equipment monitor such risks carefully. But the US also points more generally to China's National Intelligence Law passed in 2017 that says organisations must "support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work". As a result, the US, Australia and New Zealand have all blocked local firms from using Huawei to provide the technology for their 5G networks. That's three of the five so-called "Five Eyes" intelligence sharing community. A fourth, Canada, is reviewing its relationship with the firm. And several European telecoms operators are considering removing the firm's equipment from their networks. Huawei's cyber security chief John Suffolk has moved to quell concerns about its operations, describing it as "the most open [and] transparent company in the world". In December, Canada arrested Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou - Mr Ren's daughter - at the request of the US. Washington alleges that she committed fraud by lying to US banks about her firm's ties to a telecoms company that did business in Iran - and that business was a breach of sanctions on Iran. Huawei denies any wrongdoing, while China's ambassador to Canada has warned Ottawa there could be repercussions if Canada bans the firm. The UK has not taken a position, although it is also coming under pressure from the US to do so. Washington has warned its allies about the risks of using Huawei technology. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said that European countries that use the company's equipment "makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them". Why hasn't the UK blocked Huawei? The UK government has admitted to "strains" in the relationship with Huawei. The body tasked with overseeing internet security in Britain, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) - part of GCHQ - has asked Huawei to fix problems that pose "new risks" to the network. But the NCSC recently concluded that any risk posed by involving the Chinese technology giant in the development of new networks can be managed. Alex Younger, the head of the UK's intelligence service MI6, has suggested that "some decisions" lie ahead over Huawei's role, because 5G networks will make it harder to monitor security. BT has announced it is in the process of removing Huawei's equipment from the core of its existing 3G and 4G mobile operations and will not use the Chinese company's gear in central parts of the next 5G network. But Huawei has been providing technology to UK firms for more than a decade and Britain is keen to maintain a good relationship with China on trade and investment as it prepares for Brexit. Most of the country's mobile networks - Vodafone, EE and Three - have already been working with Huawei to prepare their 5G offerings and it might not be easy to change that at short notice. The UK's mobile phone operators are waiting for a decision from the government on whether they can continue to use the Chinese giant's equipment - the ruling is expected to come in late March or early April. What does Huawei say? The company is keen to portray itself as a firm with no ties to the Chinese government. It says it prioritises safety and security when supplying technology and that at least some of the hostility towards it is because the firm poses a competitive threat. In the past the Chinese government has argued that moves to block the firm's products amount to "protectionism" and "discriminatory practices". Huawei has also filed a lawsuit challenging US government restrictions on its products being used by federal agencies. In a statement announcing the move, a spokesman for Huawei said the US had "repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions". The company also accused the US government of misleading the public about Huawei. The new hostility towards the company comes against a backdrop of heightened tensions between the US and China, with President Trump accusing Beijing of unfair trade practices and of facilitating the theft of intellectual property from US firms. Furthermore as several countries simultaneously plan to introduce faster 5G networks, the stakes are high for firms that win contracts. Emily Taylor at Chatham House said there was a "standards war" going on behind the scenes. "I think the trade advantage from setting standards that favour your own domestic suppliers' technologies also plays a part in this," she told the BBC.
But the final chapter in this long saga is approaching. The government says Franco's remains will be exhumed on Thursday and moved to a cemetery in Madrid. But why were there calls for Franco's remains to be moved in the first place? And why has the issue proved so controversial? Franco ruled Spain from 1939 until his death in 1975. He was buried in a mausoleum called the Valley of the Fallen, just outside Madrid. But that site has become a shrine for the far right and is loathed by many Spaniards. Spain's Socialist government plans to move Franco's remains next to his wife's grave in a cemetery in Madrid. The exhumation is likely to last about three hours. The remains will probably be transferred by helicopter to avoid any protests. Franco's family and his far-right supporters tried in vain to block the government's plan. Franco won Spain's 1930s civil war, which was started when he rebelled against the elected leftist government. He established a dictatorship and proclaimed himself head of state. He maintained a tight grip on power until his death in 1975, after which Spain transitioned to democracy. Democracy is well established now, but the Franco era still haunts Spain. There was an unwritten "pact of forgetting" during the democratic transition and statues of Franco were removed and streets were renamed. His embalmed body currently lies at the huge Valley of the Fallen mausoleum alongside tens of thousands of victims from both sides of the civil war. But the site is reviled by many Spaniards who see it as a place dedicated to the victory of Franco's nationalist forces over their Republican opponents. It was also partly built by political prisoners, whom Franco's regime subjected to forced labour. The site is a shrine for Spain's far right who pay homage to the dictator there. It is often where Franco's supporters gather to mark the anniversary of his death. But Spain's socialist government, in power since last June, made removing Franco's remains one of its key promises. It wants the Valley of the Fallen to become "a place of commemoration, remembrance and homage to the victims of the war". It sees the presence of Franco's remains there as an affront to a mature democracy. Many descendants of Franco's victims support the plan to bury his remains elsewhere. But the issue has largely split public opinion across Spain. Last August, despite objections from his family and the right-wing People's and Citizens parties, the government approved the exhumation. It wanted to find a more low-key burial place where the dictator's followers would find it harder to pay tribute. But Franco's family (who would rather he wasn't moved at all) said he should lie in a family crypt in the Almudena Cathedral - right in the centre of Madrid. The government argued that the former dictator should not be placed anywhere he could be glorified. It also said there were potential security issues with the cathedral site. As it is a Catholic church, the Vatican also weighed in and backed the government's search for an alternative location. Then, last month, an appeal by Franco's family against the exhumation was thrown out by the Supreme Court. It unanimously backed the government's plan to move his remains. Franco will be reburied at El Pardo-Mingorrubio cemetery. The exhumation is set to start at 10:30 (08:30 GMT) on Thursday. The government wanted to carry it out before elections on 10 November and so a deadline - 25 October - was set for the exhumation. Spain's El País daily says it will be attended by a forensic scientist, relatives of Franco and Justice Minister Dolores Delgado. The cost of removing the granite slab, weighing 1.5 tonnes, is €3,090 (£2,657; $3,454), the daily reports. Francisco Franco, 1892-1975 Read more on Franco's legacy:
Has North Korea got the bomb? Technically yes - North Korea has conducted several tests with nuclear bombs. However, in order to launch a nuclear attack on its neighbours, it needs to be able to make a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on to a missile. While North Korea claims it has successfully "miniaturised" nuclear warheads, international experts have long cast doubt on these claims. Yet according to information leaked to the Washington Post in August 2017, US intelligence officials now do believe North Korea is capable of miniaturisation. How powerful are North Korea's nuclear bombs? North Korea says it has conducted five successful nuclear tests: in 2006, 2009, 2013 and in January and September 2016. The yield of the bombs appears to have increased. September 2016's test has indicated a device with an explosive yield of between 10 and 30 kilotonnes - which, if confirmed, would make it the North's strongest nuclear test ever. The other big question is whether the devices being tested are atomic bombs, or hydrogen bombs, which are more powerful. H-bombs use fusion - the merging of atoms - to unleash massive amounts of energy, whereas atomic bombs use nuclear fission, or the splitting of atoms. The 2006, 2009 and 2013 tests were all atomic bomb tests. North Korea claimed that its January 2016 test was of a hydrogen bomb. But experts cast doubt on the claim given the size of the explosion registered. Plutonium or uranium? Another question is what the starting material for the nuclear tests is. Analysts believe the first two tests used plutonium, but whether the North used plutonium or uranium as the starting material for the 2013 test is unclear. A successful uranium test would mark a significant leap forward in North Korea's nuclear programme. The North's plutonium stocks are finite, but if it could enrich uranium it could build up a nuclear stockpile. Plutonium enrichment also has to happen in large, easy-to-spot facilities, whereas uranium enrichment can more easily be carried out in secrecy. Can North Korea deliver it? There is no consensus on exactly where North Korea is in terms of miniaturising a nuclear device so that it can be delivered via a missile. According to that information leaked to the Washington Post, US intelligence officials now believe North Korea's claim that it has the technology to fit its missiles with nuclear warheads. Japan's defence ministry has also recently stated this is a possibility. The new assessment comes only weeks after North Korea tested what it said was an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the US mainland. While analysts doubt Pyongyang's claim, most experts agree the missile could reach Alaska or Hawaii. What else do we know about the North's nuclear programme? A site in the mountains near Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang, is thought to be the North's main nuclear facility, while the January and September 2016 tests were said to have been carried out at the Punggye-ri site. The Yongbyon site processes spent fuel from power stations and has been the source of plutonium for North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. Both the US and South Korea have also said that they believe the North has additional sites linked to a uranium-enrichment programme. The country has plentiful reserves of uranium ore. What has the global community done about this? The US, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea engaged the North in multiple rounds of negotiations known as six-party talks. There were various attempts to agree disarmament deals with North Korea, but none of this has ultimately deterred Pyongyang. In 2005, North Korea agreed to a landmark deal to give up its nuclear ambitions in return for economic aid and political concessions. In 2008, it destroyed the cooling tower at Yongbyon as part of the disarmament-for-aid deal. But implementing the deal proved difficult and talks stalled in 2009. The US never believed Pyongyang was fully disclosing all of its nuclear facilities - a suspicion bolstered when North Korea unveiled a uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon, purportedly for electricity generation, to US scientist Siegfried Hecker in 2010. In 2012, North Korea suddenly announced it would suspend nuclear activities and place a moratorium on missile tests in exchange for US food aid. But this came to nothing when Pyongyang tried to launch a rocket in April that year. In March 2013, after a war of words with the US and with new UN sanctions over the North's third nuclear test, Pyongyang vowed to restart all facilities at Yongbyon. By 2015, normal operations there appeared to have resumed. The 2016 tests brought international condemnation, including from China - the North's main trading partner, and only ally. In 2017, the UN agreed a new sanctions package in response to the tests. In August, US President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with "fire and fury" should the country not abandon its threats against the US. The rhetoric from Washington failed, though, to rein in Pyongyang which in turn said it was developing a strike plan to hit the US territory of Guam, an island in the Western Pacific.
By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent US universities are still the most dominant international force in the Times Higher Education rankings. In top place, as last year, is the California Institute of Technology. In the UK there are concerns that, outside Oxford, Cambridge and London colleges, many major universities are slipping down international rankings. The so-called "golden triangle" of UK universities - Oxford, Cambridge and leading London institutions - is seen as a breakaway elite group, with these universities consolidating their international reputations. Imperial College, University College London, LSE and King's College London are all in the top 40. London has more universities in this league table than all of Japan, although only Imperial College makes the top 10. Clusters of excellence Phil Baty, editor of the rankings, says this is part of a global pattern of clustering of "excellent universities". Boston in the US has eight universities in the top 200, more than entire countries such as China, Switzerland and Australia. But there are warnings from the rankings organisation that prominent UK regional universities are falling away. Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol, Sheffield, Warwick, Southampton, Nottingham and Newcastle are all seen as going downwards against international rivals. However the University of Leicester has risen sharply, which has been described as the "Richard III effect", after the high-profile research associated with the discovery of the body of the medieval king. This is described by the Times Higher Education rankings as showing that "power is draining from the UK regions". The top 20 still reflects the dominance of wealthy US university powerhouses, taking 15 of the top 20 places, with institutions such Harvard, MIT and Stanford in the leading pack behind the California Institute of Technology. The highest UK university is Oxford and the highest ranked continental European university is ETH Zurich in Switzerland, which is also the only non-English speaking university in the top 20. "No university can rest on its laurels. No-one is guaranteed to retain a top-200 place when the US, Far East and others are investing in research so heavily," said Sir David Bell, vice-chancellor of Reading University, which has fallen from 176th to 194th place. "There are some dramatic year-on-year rises and falls this year, so we should be careful not to read too much into a single set of figures." "It is no surprise that a small number of UK universities at the very top end will remain more stable, with others more likely to fluctuate." Sir Christopher Snowden, president of Universities UK, said the rankings showed that the UK had "the second-strongest university system in the world after the US". "What is clear, however, is that the UK must continue to invest in higher education if we are to maintain this global competitiveness."
The jury in Massachusetts will now decide what sentence 21-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will receive. Three people were killed and more than 260 injured when the bombs exploded at the finish line in April 2013. His lawyers admitted he played a role in the attacks but said his older brother was the driving force. The guilty conviction was widely expected. In the next phase of the trial, Tsarnaev's legal team will push for him to be given a life-in-prison sentence instead of death. His chief lawyer, Judy Clarke, specialises in defending high-profile clients facing the death penalty, including the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. Although Tsarnaev's defence team had repeatedly appealed for a change of venue, Boston is not known for its support of capital punishment. Massachusetts abolished the practice in 1984 and has not executed anyone since 1947. But Tsarnaev was convicted of federal, not state crimes. The victims Victims' profiles in full A police officer was killed in the days following the attack as Tsarnaev and his brother, who also died, attempted to flee. As the guilty verdicts were read on Wednesday, Tsarnaev kept his hands folded in front of him and looked down . Nearby, the mother of one victim, eight-year-old Martin Richard, wiped tears from her face after the verdict was read. Richard's father embraced one of the prosecutors. The governor of Massachusetts welcomed the verdict, and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh said: "I hope today's verdict provides a small amount of closure". The family of Officer Sean Collier, who was killed days after the attack, said: "While today's verdict can never bring Sean back, we are thankful that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will be held accountable for the evil that he brought to so many families." Tsarnaev's defence team say he took part in the bombing, but argue that his elder brother, Tamerlan, was the mastermind of the attack who influenced Tsarnaev into participating. Prosecutors portrayed the brothers as equal partners in a plan to "punish America" for wars in Muslim countries. Among the most damning evidence was a video that showed Tsarnaev placing a backpack bomb near to Martin Richard, and a statement scrawled inside the boat where he was found hiding days after the attack. At the scene: Tara McKelvey, BBC News A court official warned against emotional outbursts as the verdict was read. "There is to be no reactions," he told people in the room. "Maintain complete silence." People on the government's side, near the FBI agents and the Watertown, Massachusetts, police chief, had cried as they watched videos of the bombings. Today they were quiet as the verdicts were read: "guilty, guilty, guilty". Earlier Tsarnaev had given his lawyer, Judy Clarke, a half-fist-bump. She didn't return it. This afternoon he was more subdued. He stood and paid close attention as the verdicts were read, occasionally rocking from side to side. He put his hands in his pockets then took them out quickly. He has long lashes, and he blinked a lot. When he was led out of the room, he walked quickly, as before, but his step was less springy. "Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop," he wrote, as he lay wounded and bleeding inside the dry-docked boat in suburban garden. The jury was also shown a surveillance video of Tsarnaev casually purchasing milk at a nearby supermarket less than 30 minutes after the bombs wreaked carnage at the finish line. Tsarnaev is an ethnic Chechen. His family moved to the US about a decade before the bombings.
By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Diabetes - or uncontrolled blood sugar levels - is normally split into type 1 and type 2. But researchers in Sweden and Finland think the more complicated picture they have uncovered will usher in an era of personalised medicine for diabetes. Experts said the study was a herald of the future of diabetes care but changes to treatment would not be immediate. Diabetes affects about one in 11 adults worldwide and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation. Type 1 diabetes is a disease of the immune system, which affects around 10% of people with the condition in the UK. It errantly attacks the body's insulin factories (beta-cells) so there is not enough of the hormone to control blood sugar levels. Type 2 diabetes is largely seen as a disease of poor lifestyle as body fat can affect the way the insulin works. The study, by Lund University Diabetes Centre in Sweden and the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, looked at 14,775 patients including a detailed analysis of their blood. The results, published in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, showed the patients could be separated into five distinct clusters. Prof Leif Groop, one of the researchers, told the BBC: "This is extremely important, we're taking a real step towards precision medicine. "In the ideal scenario, this is applied at diagnosis and we target treatment better." The three severe forms could be treated more aggressively than the two milder ones, he said. Cluster 2 patients would currently be classified as type 2 as they do not have an autoimmune disease. However, the study suggests their disease is probably caused by a defect in their beta-cells rather than being too fat. And perhaps their treatment should more closely mirror patients who are currently classed as type 1. Cluster 2 had a higher risk of blindness while cluster 3 had the greatest risk of kidney disease, so some clusters may benefit from enhanced screening. Better classification Dr Victoria Salem, a consultant and clinical scientist at Imperial College London, said most specialists knew that type 1 and type 2 was "not a terribly accurate classification system". She told the BBC: "This is definitely the future of how we think about diabetes as a disease." But she cautioned the study would not change practice today. The study was only on Scandinavians and the risk of diabetes varies considerably around the world, such as the increased risk in South Asians. Dr Salem said: "There is still a massively unknown quantity - it may well be that worldwide there are 500 subgroups depending on genetic and local environment effects. "Their analysis has five clusters, but that may grow." Sudhesh Kumar, a professor of medicine at Warwick Medical School, said: "Clearly this is only the first step. "We also need to know if treating these groups differently would produce better outcomes." Dr Emily Burns, from Diabetes UK, said understanding the diseases could help "personalise treatments and potentially reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications in the future". She added: "This research takes a promising step toward breaking down type 2 diabetes in more detail, but we still need to know more about these subtypes before we can understand what this means for people living with the condition."

By Anthony ZurcherNorth America reporter Will any of this matter? The president - at least among his base - has appeared politically bulletproof. Bulletproof for now, however, doesn't necessarily mean bulletproof forever. At some point, the projectiles - perhaps after the mid-terms, when Republican control of Congress and power to set the political agenda may be blunted - may start finding the mark. Here's a look at just how bad a day this was for the president. Cohen has implicated Trump in criminal conduct The president's former personal lawyer didn't just stand in court on Tuesday and accuse the president of lying - although he did do that. By saying that Mr Trump - "individual-1" in the plea agreement - directed him to make or oversee payments in 2016 to secure the silence of women poised to accuse the president of having adulterous affairs with them, he effectively implicated the president in the commission of a crime. Cohen admitted that his payments constituted campaign contributions that either were directed from an illegal corporate source or in excess of allowable amounts for an individual. Both acts carry a five-year maximum prison sentence. The president in the past has denied having any knowledge of the payments. His legal team has since walked that back and asserted that he only had general knowledge after the fact. Now, however, Cohen is saying Mr Trump knew about them from the start. And it's not just Cohen's word against the president's. In the case of the payment to Karen MacDougal - "woman-1" in the plea agreement - his lawyer has already released an audio recording in which Cohen and then-candidate Mr Trump discussed the issue. Add to this the fact that "woman-2", adult film actress Stormy Daniels, is now poised to resume her lawsuit against Mr Trump to get out of her non-disclosure agreement brokered by Cohen. A judge put the suit on hold pending the criminal investigation into Cohen, which now appears to be resolved. That suit could turn up more evidence of Mr Trump's involvement in the illegal $130,000 hush-money payment Cohen has now confessed to making to her on the eve of the 2016 election. It's heavy seas ahead for the president any way you look at it. Special counsel team notches a trial conviction Special Counsel Robert Mueller was under considerable pressure to get a conviction in his case against former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort. Even though the charges did not directly relate to the central thrust of his investigation into possible Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, it was the first time his team had to face a jury. If they had walked away without a conviction, either through a hung jury or an outright acquittal, the accusations from Trump loyalists that the investigation was a waste of resources and time would have reached a fevered pitch. It wasn't an across-the-board victory for Mr Mueller, given that the jury couldn't reach a verdict on 10 of the 18 counts, but convictions on tax fraud, failing to disclose foreign bank accounts and bank fraud are points on the board. Add that to the numerous indictments of Russian individuals and companies and plea agreements already reached with Trump campaign officials George Papadopolous, Michael Flynn and Rick Gates, as well as with London lawyer Alex van der Zwaan and computer programmer Richard Pinedo, and the special counsel team is producing a growing list of accomplishments. Pressure on Manafort mounts After the verdicts were announced, Manafort's lawyer told the press that his client was "disappointed". That may be a bit of an understatement. Even with convictions on only eight of the 18 criminal counts against him, Mr Trump's former campaign chair could be looking at a lengthy prison sentence. And Manafort faces a second trial in Washington DC next month for money laundering, acting as an unregistered foreign agent, conspiracy to defraud the US, making false statements and witness tampering. It's the bulk of the legal case against the long-time Washington lobbyist. Manafort's lawyers had insisted on the two separate trials, perhaps because they thought they he had a better chance of acquittal from an Alexandria jury or friendlier federal judges in the Northern Virginia district. If so, that plan backfired. Manafort may be hoping for a presidential pardon, given that Mr Trump has said his prosecution was politically motivated and that he was a "good man". The president can only pardon for federal crimes, however, and Manafort's conviction on tax fraud opens him up to future state-level charges, which Mr Trump has no power to forgive. Now 69-year-old Manafort is facing a lengthy prison sentence - and more legal battles to come. And while he hasn't shown a willingness to co-operate with Mr Mueller's investigation so far, that could change. Manafort, after all, attended the June 2016 Trump tower meeting set up by Donald Trump Jr with Russian nationals, originally billed as a means to gather damaging information about Democrat Hillary Clinton. He took a series of cryptic notes on the topic, which he might be willing to explain to the special counsel - in exchange for lightened sentence. Having one's former campaign chair end up as a convicted felon is not good news. If Manafort flips, however, a bad day for Mr Trump could, in hindsight, be a catastrophic one. Flynn is still co-operating Buried under Tuesday afternoon's news was another nugget from the special counsel's office, that it has requested the sentencing of former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn be delayed once again. "Due to the status of the investigation, the Special Counsel's Office does not believe that this matter is ready to be scheduled for a sentencing hearing at this time," Mr Mueller's lawyers told the court overseeing Flynn's plea deal. That would indicate that Flynn, who has admitted to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials during the Trump presidential transition, is still co-operating with Mr Mueller and that his usefulness to the investigation is ongoing. It might also mean that a formal sentencing hearing could reveal information Mr Mueller would prefer to keep secret at this time. Either way, it's a sign that, behind the scenes, gears are still grinding in Mr Mueller's investigation. Another early Trump supporter is charged Two weeks ago Chris Collins of New York, the first member of the House of Representatives to endorse Mr Trump's presidential bid, was indicted for insider trading. On Tuesday afternoon, Duncan Hunter - the second congressman to do so - was charged with using campaign funds for personal expenses, including trips for his family to Hawaii and Italy. Earlier in the day Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiled a sweeping programme of political reform measures she said were necessary to address widespread political corruption in Washington DC. That included a ban on all lobbying by former top government officials, a prohibition of all members of Congress and White House staff from holding individual corporate stocks and a requirement that all president and vice-presidential candidates disclose eight years of tax returns. Similar calls for fixing a broken political system helped Democrats sweep into power in Congress in 2006. It did the same for Republicans in 1994. Mr Trump's "drain the swamp" rhetoric was a constant rallying cry for his supporters in 2016. After Tuesday's onslaught of convictions, pleas and indictments, Warren's slate of proposals could prove to be a potent mid-term weapon for Democrats this November, if they know how to use it.
Most respondents said they thought NI would still be part of the UK in 10 years time, but not in 25 years. In NI, 49% of people said if there was a border poll today they would vote to remain in the UK, with 43% backing a united Ireland and 8% undecided. The poll was commissioned by BBC NI's Spotlight programme. In the Republic of Ireland, where a vote would have to be held in parallel with any border poll in Northern Ireland, 51% said they would vote for a United Ireland, 27% would vote for Northern Ireland to stay in the UK and 22% were not sure. When asked if they thought NI woud be part of the UK in 10 years, 55% in NI and 59% in the Republic of Ireland said they thought it would be. But when asked if this would be the case in 25 years, 51% of people in NI and 54% in the Republic said NI would have left the UK. The poll also suggested that only 40% of people in Northern Ireland saw its formation 100 years ago as a cause for celebration. Most people on both sides of the Irish border believed there was a potential for a return to political violence in Northern Ireland, according to the poll. The poll was carried out over the Easter period when clashes were taking place in a number of areas across Northern Ireland, sparked by loyalist anger over the Northern Ireland trade protocol and the Police Service of Northern Ireland's handling of a republican funeral during the pandemic. Of those surveyed in Northern Ireland, 76% agreed with the proposition that "the dispute over Northern Ireland's status remains unresolved and there is still a potential for violence in the future". In the Republic, an even higher proportion, 87%, echoed that view. A total of 48% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland told the pollsters they want the controversial trade protocol introduced as part of the UK's EU Withdrawal Agreement scrapped, in line with demands from the DUP and other unionist parties, while 46% wanted the protocol to be retained. Unionists have claimed the protocol, which requires checks on goods moving across the Irish Sea from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, threatens the constitutional integrity of the UK. Interviewed for the Spotlight programme, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Micheál Martin insisted the protocol was not tearing the UK apart, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was working to "sandpaper" away what he described as the "ludicrous barriers" to trade across the Irish Sea. In the Republic, a majority of those surveyed supported the Irish government's defence of the trade protocol, with 74% saying it should not be scrapped. Although within Northern Ireland a larger number of people rejected the trade protocol than backed it, the poll also provided an indication that a majority wants to retain some form of economic link with the EU. Some 56% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland told the pollsters that they wanted their assembly members (MLAs) to vote to stay within the EU Single Market when the matter is put to a vote at Stormont in three years' time. Only 38% indicated they wanted to leave the EU Single Market. In Northern Ireland 37% of people surveyed told the pollsters they would like to see a border poll within the next five years, whilst a further 29% want it to happen at some point after that. However the prime minister told the Spotlight programme that he cannot see any Northern Ireland secretary considering a border poll for a "very, very long time to come". The prime minister told BBC Northern Ireland that as "a proud unionist" he views the centenary of Northern Ireland's formation as a cause for celebration. However only 40% of the people surveyed agreed with the proposition that "the formation of Northern Ireland 100 years ago was an achievement which should be celebrated", while 45% disagreed with the statement. Outright celebration of the centenary turned out to be the least popular of five options included in the survey. In Northern Ireland, 48% agreed that the partition of Ireland and the creation of a land border 100 years ago was "a negative development which should be regretted". A total of 50% wanted to concentrate on current challenges such as the Covid pandemic rather than the centenary, whilst 61% backed marking Northern Ireland's formation in a neutral manner acknowledging the differing opinions on the subject. The same proportion, 61%, agreed with the statement "Northern Ireland's history is not just about constitutional politics and the centenary should provide an opportunity to showcase its sporting, business, scientific and cultural achievements". In the Republic, celebrating the formation of Northern Ireland was even more unpopular with just 12% agreeing with the proposition. The most popular options were marking this year's centenary in a neutral manner, which was favoured by 74% of those surveyed and regretting partition - a view 71% agreed with. The poll commissioned by BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme was carried out by the NI Pollsters LucidTalk and the Irish polling firm Ireland Thinks. The margin of error is +/- 2.5%. The results from a number of other questions in the survey regarding what should happen to the Irish flag, national anthem, the Stormont Executive and the health service in the event of a United Ireland will be released on BBC Northern Ireland's political programme The View on Thursday night. Full details of the poll will be available via the BBC NI news website and other BBC news and current affairs programmes during the course of the week.

But Danai, 19, is now defying his father's warning. A law student in Bangkok, he is one of tens of thousands of protesters who have packed the streets of the Thai capital every month this summer, demanding reform of the monarchy. His father Pakorn is a well-travelled, upper middle class man. His name and his son's name have been changed to protect their identity. Although they don't live in the same house, they still see each other often. But every time they meet, they avoid speaking about one subject: the monarchy. "If we talk about it we'll have a row and it will ruin our day," Danai says. "Once we had an argument in our car after I criticised the king. For my father the king is untouchable. I asked, why? He said that I am too young to understand. He got very angry, then he went quiet and wouldn't speak to me." Danai's family isn't alone. Disagreements like this over the role of an institution with sacrosanct status in Thailand is playing out in homes - in cities and in the countryside - around the country. Falling out online But families in Thailand don't just argue about the monarchy face-to-face, many decide to have it out on social media. And things can get pretty extreme. When a university student in the northern city of Chiang Mai revealed on Facebook in September that her father wanted to sue her because of her anti-monarchy views, he responded by posting that she was no longer allowed to use his family name. Pakorn believes that university teachers are responsible for his son's behaviour. "In Thai society there are groups of hard-core people who are anti-royalists. Also the internet and social media keep pouring out misleading information and fake news. Young people absorb quickly without filtering," he says. Danai challenged his father about the monarchy for the first time when he was 17. "We were at the cinema. Before the film started, when the royal anthem was played as usual, everyone stood up to pay respect to the king. I didn't want to do that, so I stayed in my seat. My father forced me to get up, but I resisted. Only when people started staring at us, did I finally stand." Refusing to stand when the royal anthem was playing used to be illegal in Thailand, until the law was repealed in 2010. But failing to do so is still seen by many as disrespecting the monarchy. Historic tradition Thais are taught from birth to revere and love their king, but also to fear the consequences of speaking out against him. The so-called Land of Smiles is one of a very small number of countries with a lese majeste law. This means that criticising the king, the queen or the heir to the throne is illegal - and anyone doing so could be jailed for up to 15 years. Today, Danai doesn't stand up in the cinema any more. Since July, thousands of university students have taken to the streets, and have continued to do so despite a state of emergency in recent days and the arrest of many of the protest leaders. They are demanding curbs on the king's nearly unlimited powers and finances. These requests may seem tame to people in other parts of the world, but in Thailand no one has publicly challenged the monarchy in modern history. The student protests shocked most Thais - including Danai's father, Pakorn. "I was born in the reign of King Rama IX. He did more for his people than for his own children. When he was ill, I was ready to leave this world if that could have made him live longer. But Generation Z, like my son, don't have that experience." A new king This clash of generations would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. But the crowning of the new monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, changed everything. The new king is rarely seen in public, and spends most of his time in Germany - even more so since Thailand was hit by the coronavirus pandemic. There have been questions over his decision to take personal command of all military units based in Bangkok - a concentration of military power in royal hands unprecedented in modern Thailand. His private life is also much talked about. Divorced three times, he married last year for a fourth time. He also appointed a woman who'd been his bodyguard as his official consort, before disowning and then reinstating her. By contrast, the late King Rama IX was seen by many as semi-divine. Everywhere he went people would lie before him and call themselves "the dust under his feet". Pakorn saw the late king in person twice. "One time, I was in my car and I saw him driving by himself, coming in the opposite direction. There was no motorcade, no sirens. Our eyes met. I was shocked. I think he just wanted to do things like other people, easy and informal. I felt he had an aura around him, his presence was very special." However during the last 10 years of Rama IX's life, he was ill and stayed in hospital most of the time. Young Thais like Danai rarely saw him in public. Even so, when the king died Danai posted messages on Facebook showing his sadness and gratitude toward him. He told the BBC he now regrets doing that. "I've just realised that what I was told about him at the time or before that was all propaganda." Questioning the past Danai can't understand his father's feelings for the king. "He is blinded by his love for the monarchy. Talking to him is like talking to a wall. He doesn't want to listen. For now, the only thing I want from my father is for him to be open-minded about this subject, as he normally is with any another issue." Danai believes his mother is also a royalist but does not support the monarchy as much as his dad. She doesn't ever criticise the monarchy however - and she thinks the protests will fail. "My mum thinks that reforming the monarchy is something out of reach and protesters can't make this happen," says Danai. Pakorn says he does not know if getting older and wiser in the future will help his son get closer to him again, and put them back on the same track they both used to be on. Danai is not sure either. "It might be possible that I might change my mind about the institution. But I don't think it will happen because I will get older," he says. "It depends on what happens in reality and the information I receive." The souring of their relationship because of their opposing views on the king reflects a widening generational divide emblematic of Thai society. Since the student protests started, families all over Thailand have become increasingly divided. Parents and children, brothers and sisters, aunts and nephews are all becoming strangers. A young generation of Thais is questioning the monarchy and everything it represents - and this is likely to be just the beginning of a long, internal struggle.
The proposal requires the government to receive a court order to access telecom companies' records. The NSA is understood to collect daily call records from specific telecom firms and to keep them for five years. The plan follows widespread anger after leaks revealed the full extent of US surveillance operations. "I believe this approach will best ensure that we have the information we need to meet our intelligence needs while enhancing public confidence in the manner in which the information is collected and held," Mr Obama said in a statement on Thursday. Reasonable suspicion Under the new proposal, the government will reportedly only seek specific records that telecom companies possess. The government must gain approval from a secret surveillance court - proving there is a reasonable suspicion that a phone number is connected to a terrorist - in order to access the record. An agency may conduct a search without prior approval in cases of emergency, though it remains unclear what constitutes an emergency under the proposal. The telecom companies will be required to search for specific numbers of a limited time period. The government previously had the ability to search for numbers only distantly linked to a suspicious number, but would now be limited to accessing only a specific number and direct contacts. Documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden have revealed the US collects massive amounts of electronic data from communications of private individuals around the world, and has snooped on foreign leaders. In a speech in January, President Obama said it was necessary for the US to continue collecting large amounts of data, but that civil liberties must be respected. The Obama administration has said it plans to renew the current NSA programme for at least another 90 days until Congress passes the new bill. New legislation has also been developed separately by leaders of the House intelligence committee that would allow the NSA to issue subpoenas for specific phone records without prior judicial approval, the New York Times reports.
Alibaba has been accused by its smaller rival JD.com of "forcing retailers" to promote their sales exclusively with its own outlet, Tmall. JD.com has lodged a complaint with the Chinese industry and commerce watchdog but Alibaba denies the allegation. The retail giant claims its rival is "panicking because they're losing". "They simply can't match our customer and merchant experience and logistical scale because Alibaba wins with customers and merchants as we provide a superior experience for users on our platforms," said Jim Wilkinson, Alibaba's senior vice president of international corporate affairs. The Wall Street Journal reported that a shoe retailer called Mulinsen had declined to promote JD's Singles Day event. Singles Day began in the early 1990s as a day for people not in relationships to treat themselves, in the spirit of Valentines Day. The Chinese State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) has accepted the complaint and warned retailers "not to use malicious marketing methods to engage in competition" ahead of the event, according to the Xinhua news agency. A recent change in legislation bans online retailers limiting promotional activity by their merchants on other platforms. Last year, Alibaba recorded $9.3bn (£5.9bn) sales during the annual event, which it adopted in 2009.
That's according to Save Face - the national register for professionals who carry out things like fillers and Botox. The warning comes as a BBC survey suggests nearly 50% of men between 18-30 "might consider" having a procedure. The government is about to launch a campaign in England to tackle cosmetic treatments that go wrong. The survey, commissioned by Radio 1 Newsbeat and the Victoria Derbyshire programme, found that of those who'd had a cosmetic procedure in the past, abdominal implants and Botox were among the most common. Save Face says they get more men visiting their site than women now and the number of complaints from them has risen dramatically. "There is a definite trend of men seeking these procedures and in turn men who are suffering complications when procedures go wrong," says Ashton Collins from the group. She says images on social media and programmes like Love Island and Geordie Shore are partly responsible for men wanting to change their bodies. And it seems the perfect torso is what a lot of men under 30 are aiming for. As part of this BBC survey of around 2,000 men and women, respondents were asked what part of them they would most like to change - the most popular choices among men were their stomach and chest, with 34% selecting them. Worried about his chest, Mike decided to have surgery to reduce what he calls his "man boobs." "You'd be out at the gym and you'd be conscious of it. Everywhere you go you are conscious of it," he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat Two weeks after his operation he insists he has had no complications and is really pleased that he went ahead with it. "I Just feel so confident. It almost makes you feel more masculine, more manly," he says. Diren Kartel is an online personal trainer. He says a lot of men tell him they want to improve the shape of their torsos. "Even me, when I first started training, I wanted abs. When I was younger, I wanted abs. Every guy wants abs." But he says having abdominal definition doesn't always mean you are healthy and he would recommend exercise and a balanced diet to get the body you want. "Even thinking about doing surgery to get abs is shocking. That is not going to fix the problem. If anything they are creating more of a problem doing that. "I would advise you don't do it. If you train well, if you eat well, and change your lifestyle instead of trying to fix something as a quick fix it is going to be so much more beneficial for you." Diren isn't afraid to call out celebrities and online influencers who aren't truthful about how they get their bodies Instagram ready. "All these celebrities having the perfect physique, if as a kid you don't have this, it might seem that this is a problem. "If the celebrity is purposely promoting the fact that having abs is being healthy then that is wrong as it isn't the case." Ashton Collins from Save Face is concerned that some men may be more likely to fall victim to badly-done procedures because they are embarrassed to talk about wanting to have something done. "For men, there is still a barrier to talk about it openly with friends as women would which can leave them falling foul to bad practice and falling in to the wrong hands," she says. "There are a lot of men that are going on social media and finding the cheapest price they come across which inevitably leads to complications."

A young couple with children will need nearly 12 years to get enough money for a deposit. The independent research shows for the first time the different savings periods needed in each of the English regions. The research assumed that home-buyers needed a deposit of 20%. Affordability is worst in London, where it is claimed that a single person needs 29.5 years to raise the money needed, and a couple with children needs 20 years. The easiest area to buy a home is in the North East, where a single person needs nine years of saving, and a couple with children needs 8.8 years. Choice Lauren Pinney is a 29 year-old teacher from Brighton. She and her husband Ivan currently share a flat, and they would like to start a family. But buying a home of their own is unaffordable. "I don't think we'll ever be able to save for a house," she told the BBC. "It is difficult to save while you are renting, so I think it'll be one or the other: a flat or a family. If we want a family, we'll have to give up the dream of owning a home," she said. Even with a 5% deposit, available through the government's Help to Buy scheme, Lauren says a home is out of reach. "A two bedroom flat in Brighton costs £200,000, so a 5% deposit would still mean finding £10,000, which is too much," she said. Between herself and her husband, who works as a gardener, they have good salaries, with a joint income of £50,000. "Despite working hard and saving what they can each month, today's young people face life-changing choices between starting a family or buying a home of their own," said Campbell Robb, Shelter's chief executive. "Meanwhile, single people face an added pressure to either find a partner or to live with their parents well into their thirties if they're ever to have a hope of saving enough for a deposit," he said. Rents Meanwhile another report pointed out that renting is not a cheap alternative to home ownership. Average rents in England and Wales could hit £800 a month by 2015, said LSL Property Services, the largest lettings agency in the UK. That represents a 21% rise since 2010. The LSL report said 20% of the population will be living in the private rented sector by that time. "Fundamentally, buying a home is still becoming less affordable, not more," said Lucy Jones of LSL. "Renting was the future before the recession - it cushioned many during - and it's still the future for millions," she said. She went on to call for "financial mechanisms" to make more homes available for rent, in an effort to keep prices down.
By Celestina OlulodeNewsbeat reporter To separate the facts from myths, we've put your questions to health experts. Dr Alex George is an A&E doctor and former Love Island contestant. Alix Fox is a sex journalist, presenter of BBC Radio 1's Unexpected Fluids show, and co-host of The Modern Mann podcast. Is it safe to have sex during the coronavirus outbreak? Dr Alex George: If you're in a relationship… living with that person, and sharing the same environment, it shouldn't change your situation. However if one of you is displaying symptoms of coronavirus then you should maintain your social-distancing and isolate, even within your home. In an ideal world everyone would stay two metres apart - even in their own house, but we realise this may not be realistic. Alix Fox: It's also really important not to assume that if you are experiencing mild symptoms of coronavirus it will be the same for your partner. So, if you're showing any symptoms whatsoever do try and stay away from your lover. What about sex with new people? Dr Alex: I certainly wouldn't advise having new sexual partners at the moment, because the risk is you could pass on the virus. Alix Fox: Don't forget as well, some people who are carriers of the virus won't have any symptoms. So even if you feel absolutely fine… you could still pass on the infection to someone and they could pass it on to other people via close contact and kissing. I kissed someone I recently met, and they've gone on to develop symptoms. What should I do? Dr Alex: If you've kissed or been in contact with someone who you think has gone on to develop coronavirus, make sure you self-isolate. Keep an eye on your symptoms. If you are developing symptoms, then be extra careful. Go online to the nhs.uk website. Only call the 111 service if your symptoms are so bad that you need medical support from us. Alix Fox: We should be responsible with each other, and for ourselves in our relationships. If you're somebody who has developed symptoms, and you know that you've kissed people recently, you should let them know. And even if you've kissed someone and they've got symptoms and you haven't, you should also self-isolate. I wasn't using condoms with my partner before coronavirus, should I start now? Alix Fox: The answer depends on why you weren't using condoms. If you weren't using condoms because you have both been tested for STIs, or you're in a heterosexual relationship prior to menopause and are using another kind of contraception to prevent an unplanned pregnancy, then that's fine. But if you weren't using condoms because you were relying on something like the pull-out method - or you were taking chances with STIs - then it's even more important that you use condoms now. Can I get coronavirus by touching someone else's vagina or penis? Dr Alex: If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva. Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus. We want to cut this back to the absolute minimum. So, no contact between a partner that you're not living with is really important. How can I maintain a relationship at a time like this? I don't want to be single now. Alix Fox: This whole pandemic is prompting a lot of people to rethink what a good sex life is and what constitutes as an enjoyable, pleasurable exchange. I've heard of people writing erotic stories to each other, and people who are dating but quarantined in different places taking advantage of the time and the distance. A lot of people have been getting really creative. If you use your imagination a little bit there are lots of ways you can have a sexy time without being face-to-face with somebody. It's also important to remember that right now… some people might be discovering that they or their partners have different libidos. You might find yourself in a situation where you were only going on a date once a week, and suddenly you're living under the same roof. You might find that you want sex when your partner doesn't, or vice versa. It's important to communicate this in a respectful, compassionate manner. Living together does not mean that you're entitled to sex whenever you want. And for anybody who is in a situation where they're with a partner and they're not having a good time, because they feel like they're being forced into sex, there are helplines available for that. Am I more at risk of catching coronavirus if I have HIV? Alix Fox: Dr Michael Brady at the Terrence Higgins Trust has provided some really great advice on this. If you are already on regular medication to manage HIV, and you have a good CD4 count (number of white blood cells to fight infection) and an undetectable viral load (the amount of HIV in the blood) then you're not considered to have a weakened immune system. This means you run no additional risk of contracting coronavirus. So, if you're HIV positive, continue taking your meds as you would do. Make sure that you follow the same rules as everybody else when it comes to things like isolation. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

The company now says it will replace batteries for less and will issue software in 2018 so customers can monitor their phone's battery health. Some customers had long suspected the company slowed older iPhones to encourage customers to upgrade. Apple admitted slowing some phones with ageing batteries but said it was to "prolong the life" of the devices. In a statement posted on its website, the firm said it would reduce the price of an out-of-warranty battery replacement from $79 to $29 in the US for anyone with an iPhone 6 or later. In the UK the prices will drop from £79 to £25. It said it was pushing ahead with measures to "address customers' concerns, to recognise their loyalty and to regain the trust of anyone who may have doubted Apple's intentions". "At Apple, our customers' trust means everything to us. We will never stop working to earn and maintain it. We are able to do the work we love only because of your faith and support - and we will never forget that or take it for granted," it said. The firm has had eight separate lawsuits in the US filed against it over the matter, and had also been facing additional legal action in Israel and France. Apple acknowledged earlier this month that it does deliberately slow down some models of the iPhone as they age. It said it had made changes to the iOS operating system to manage ageing lithium-ion batteries in some devices, because the batteries' performance diminishes over time. "Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, [when they] have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components," the company said. It also emerged on Thursday that the tech giant's chief executive Tim Cook had been ordered by the firm to only use private jets for both business and personal transport for security reasons. In November, Apple was forced to release an update to fix a security issue with its Mac operating system that made it possible to gain entry to a device and administrative powers without a password.
Chinese exporters into the US - including Suntech - will now face customs tariffs of between 2.9% and 4.73%, the Commerce Department said. In 2011, imports of solar cells from China into the US were valued at $3.1bn (£1.96bn), it added. The price of solar panels dropped more than 30% last year, mainly linked to cheaper panels made in China. "Countervailable subsidies are financial assistance from foreign governments that benefit the production of goods from foreign companies," the Commerce Department said. China's Suntech, the world's largest producer of solar panels, will now face duties of 2.9% to offset what the US said is its subsidy from the Chinese government. Another firm, Changzhou Trina Solar Energy, will receive duties of 4.73%. All others face duties of 3.61%. US customs will collect deposits equivalent to these amounts now and the Commerce Department will make a final ruling in June. The US will also rule on whether China's solar panel output is violating its anti-dumping rules on 17 May. Chinese firms have said that they are not the only ones that receive government help - for example, the US has subsidies to encourage people to install solar panels. China has already said it will launch its own investigation into US government support for renewable energy.
By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website They said the "surprise" findings, reported at the European Breast Cancer Conference, could mean some women no longer need chemotherapy. The drugs, tested on 257 women, target a specific weakness found in one-in-ten breast cancers. Experts said the findings were a "stepping stone" to tailored cancer care. The doctors leading the trial had not expected or even intended to achieve such striking results. They were investigating how drugs changed cancers in the short window between a tumour being diagnosed and the operation to remove it. But by the time surgeons came to operate, there was no sign of cancer in some patients. Prof Judith Bliss, from the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said the impact was "dramatic". She told the BBC News website: "We were particularly surprised by these findings as this was a short-term trial. "It became apparent some had a complete response. It's absolutely intriguing, it is so fast." The drugs were lapatinib and trastuzumab, which is more widely known as Herceptin. They both target HER2 - a protein that fuels the growth of some women's breast cancers. Herceptin works on the surface of cancerous cells while lapatinib is able to penetrate inside the cell to disable HER2. The study, which also took place at NHS hospitals in Manchester, gave the treatment to women with tumours measuring between 1 and 3cm. In less than two weeks of treatment, the cancer disappeared entirely in 11% of cases, and in a further 17% they were smaller than 5mm. Current therapy for HER2 positive breast cancers is surgery, followed by chemotherapy and Herceptin. But Prof Bliss believes the findings could eventually mean some women do not need chemotherapy. However, that will require larger studies especially as HER2 positive cancers have a higher risk of coming back. "We would have to be very clear we're not taking a backwards step and increasing the risk of relapse," Prof Bliss added. Baroness Delyth Morgan, the chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said: "We hope this particularly impressive combination trial will serve as a stepping stone to an era of more personalised treatment for HER2 positive breast cancer. "Such a rapid response to treatment could soon give doctors the unprecedented ability to identify women responding so well that they would not need gruelling chemotherapy." Breast cancer is now thought of as at least ten separate diseases, each with a different cause, life expectancy and needing a different treatment. Matching the specific errors in a tumour to targeted drugs is considered the future of cancer medicine. Breast cancers, and particularly HER2 positive tumours, are at the forefront of this revolution in treatment. Prof Arnie Purushotham, from Cancer Research UK which funded the study, said: "These results are very promising if they stand up in the long run, and could be the starting step of finding a new way to treat HER2 positive breast cancers."

By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent The 25-year-old needed hospital treatment after his lungs could not get enough oxygen into his body. Reinfections remain rare and he has now recovered. But the study in the Lancet Infectious Diseases raises questions about how much immunity can be built up to the virus. The man from Nevada had no known health problems or immune defects that would make him particularly vulnerable to Covid. What happened when Scientists say the patient caught coronavirus twice, rather than the original infection becoming dormant and then bouncing back. A comparison of the genetic codes of the virus taken during each bout of symptoms showed they were too distinct to be caused by the same infection. "Our findings signal that a previous infection may not necessarily protect against future infection," said Dr Mark Pandori, from the University of Nevada. "The possibility of reinfections could have significant implications for our understanding of Covid-19 immunity." He said even people who have recovered should continue to follow guidelines around social distancing, face masks and hand washing. Scientists are still grappling with the thorny issue of coronavirus and immunity. Does everyone become immune? Even people with very mild symptoms? How long does any protection last? These are important questions for understanding how the virus will affect us long-term and may have implications for vaccines and ideas such as herd immunity. So far, reinfection seems to be rare - there have been only a few examples out of more than 37 million confirmed cases. Reports in Hong Kong, Belgium and the Netherlands said they were no more serious than the first. One in Ecuador mirrored the US case in being more severe, but did not need hospital treatment. However, it is still early into the pandemic, and the history of other types of coronavirus means protection is expected to wane. As countries endure a second wave of the virus, we may start to get clearer answers. It had been assumed that a second round of Covid would be milder, as the body would have learned to fight the virus the first time around. It is still unclear why the Nevada patient became more severely ill the second time. One idea is he may have been exposed to a bigger initial dose of the virus. It also remains possible that the initial immune response made the second infection worse. This has been documented with diseases like dengue fever, where antibodies made in response to one strain of dengue virus cause problems if infected by another strain. Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said the study was "very concerning" because of the small gap between the two infections, and the severity of the second. "Given the fact that to date over 37 million people have had the infection, we would have expected to have heard of many more incidents if such very early reinfections with severe illness were common. "It is too early to say for certain what the implications of these findings are for any immunisation programme. But these findings reinforce the point that we still do not know enough about the immune response to this infection." Follow James on Twitter
In a speech, he questioned whether institutions were attracting the best students - with only half of student visas issued for university courses. Home Office research suggests a fifth of students are still in the UK five years after being granted visas. But the National Union of Students dismissed Mr Green's comments as a "misinterpretation" of the facts. The Home Office study tracked non-EU migrants who came to the UK in 2004. The largest group - some 185,000 people - were students, and 21% were still in the country five years later. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw says this, together with an increasing number of new overseas students, has led Mr Green to make reform of the student immigration route a priority. 'Out of control' Ministers also intend to examine work visas as two-fifths of people in this group remained in the UK after five years. Ahead of his speech, Mr Green said: "We can't assume that everyone coming here has skills the UK workforce cannot offer." He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't want to interfere with the success stories of our universities." But he said there was a need to examine closely sub-degree courses and the reasons for students remaining in the UK. Mr Green said: "Why are they staying on? What are they staying on to do? This is part of a wider look we need to take at the immigration system." Office for National Statistics figures released last month showed net migration to the UK increased by 33,000 to 196,000 in 2009. The number of visas issued to students went up by 35% to 362,015. Mr Green said the figures were proof the coalition government had inherited an immigration system "largely out of control". In his speech at the Royal Commonwealth Club, Mr Green said an annual cap on economic migrants from outside the EU would not be enough to reduce net immigration to the "tens of thousands". 'Politically motivated' Internal Home Office estimates showed more than 90,000 people were coming into Britain every year to do courses below degree level at private institutions, Mr Green said. "The foreign students attending these various establishments may, or frankly may not be, the brightest and the best. "I want to ensure those who come here to study at language schools or any other institutions play by the rules and leave when their visas expire. "We need to decide whether this is right and also whether it is the best thing for the students themselves, given the high financial commitments required of them." But Aaron Porter, president of the National Union of Students, said: "To suggest that the levels of those coming to the UK to study is too high is a politically motivated misinterpretation of the huge contribution which international students make to our colleges, universities and the economy. "The government should be proud that students choose to study in this country creating an education industry worth £12.5bn a year to the British economy." Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: "Populist policies on immigration might play well domestically, but on the global stage we risk looking foolish. "Damian Green is making his speech today after returning from a trip to India where he encouraged students to come to the UK." Join the debate
The recording is being verified by the US National Weather Service. It comes amid a heatwave on the US's west coast, where temperatures are forecast to rise further this week. The scorching conditions have led to two days of blackouts in California, after a power plant malfunctioned on Saturday. "It's an oppressive heat and it's in your face," Brandi Stewart, who works at Death Valley National Park, told the BBC. Ms Stewart has lived and worked at the national park on and off for five years. She spends a lot of her time indoors in August because it's simply too uncomfortable to be outside. "When you walk outside it's like being hit in the face with a bunch of hairdryers," she said. "You feel the heat and it's like walking into an oven and the heat is just all around you." What were the previous records? Sunday's reading was recorded in Furnace Creek in Death Valley. Before this, the highest temperature reliably recorded on Earth was 129.2F (54C) - also in Death Valley in 2013. A higher reading of 134F, or 56.6C a century earlier, also in Death Valley, is disputed. It is believed by some modern weather experts to have been erroneous, along with several other searing temperatures recorded that summer. According to a 2016 analysis from weather historian Christopher Burt, other temperatures in the region recorded in 1913 do not corroborate the Death Valley reading. Another record temperature for the planet - 131F, or 55C - was recorded in Tunisia in 1931, but Mr Burt said this reading, as well as others recorded in Africa during the colonial era, had "serious credibility issues". What about the heatwave? The current heatwave stretches from Arizona in the south-west, up the coast to Washington state in the north-west. It is expected to hit its peak on Monday and Tuesday, before temperatures start to drop later in the week. However, the sweltering heat will continue for at least another 10 days. As temperatures soared in California, a large "firenado" was observed on Saturday in Lassen County. California's Independent System Operator (CISO), which manages the state's power, has declared a Stage 3 Emergency, meaning "when demand [for electricity] begins to outpace supply". Because so much of the region's power relies on solar and wind energy, and because people use their electricity for air conditioning, during heatwaves the power grid becomes strained and is at risk of completely malfunctioning. In order to manage the state's demand for power and prevent a complete shutdown, officials are using scheduled rolling blackouts to control and conserve energy. What are the effects of extreme heat? Officials define extreme heat as a period of two to three days of high heat and humidity, with temperatures above 90F (32C). US public health body the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says heatwaves have killed more people on average than any other extreme weather event in the country. The immediate effects of heatwaves on the human body are heat cramps, dehydration and even potentially fatal heat strokes. However, extreme heat can also exacerbate pre-existing health conditions, including respiratory diseases, heart conditions and kidney disorders, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. It can affect infrastructure, too. As well as straining power grids and causing blackouts, extreme heat can ground planes, melt roads, and cause the inside of cars to overheat to dangerous levels. Heatwaves can also have a severe impact on agriculture - either by causing vegetables to wilt and die, or by encouraging the spread of plant diseases.
The fire in the town of Bautzen in the early hours of Sunday morning destroyed the roof of a former hotel, which was being converted into a migrant shelter. Police said some of the crowd tried to prevent firefighters from extinguishing the blaze, which destroyed the roof. The premier of Saxony, Stanislaw Tillich, described them as "criminals". Police suspect arson. The investigation includes detectives who normally deal with extremist crimes. No-one was hurt. 'Unashamed delight' Only a few days ago, protesters in another Saxon town, Clausnitz, blocked the arrival of a bus taking migrants to accommodation. They shouted, "We are the people", the slogan of the 1989 peaceful uprising which led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany. The director of the Clausnitz migrant shelter is a member of the anti-immigrant Alternativ fuer Deutschland (AfD) party. Police in Bautzen said many in the crowd watched the fire and commented with "unashamed delight". Two drunken men were arrested after they refused to leave the scene. The converted hotel was supposed to house 300 migrants. In a further sign of anti-migrant sentiment, police in the Brandenburg region are investigating the distribution of leaflets urging "absolute resistance" against "foreigner invasion". The leaflets, put through letterboxes in the town of Nauen, are the suspected work of neo-Nazis. They also give instructions on making firebombs and using explosives. On Saturday, police defended their response to events in Clausnitz after two videos surfaced online. The first video showed 100 hostile demonstrators preventing a bus from off-loading migrants into their accommodation on Thursday. A second appeared to show police roughly manhandling a boy from the bus into the building. The regional police chief said there were too few police to keep the protesters away, and three of those inside the bus had provoked the crowd. Germany received over a million asylum claims in 2015 and has been widely admired for opening its doors. But with that have come increasing reports of anti-migrant incidents amid fears of a backlash, correspondents say. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
On Sunday pollution readings were about 50 times higher than that considered safe by the World Health Organization. State media have blamed the local government for the thick smog. Pollution is a perennial problem in China's northeast, home to heavy industries including coal mining. In some parts of Shenyang, Sunday's readings of tiny particulate which can get into the lungs, known as PM 2.5, exceeded 1,400 micrograms per cubic metre, according to state media People's Daily. The WHO recommends a maximum 24-hour average of 25 mg per cubic metre. "As far as we are aware from the data we have been observing over the past few years, this is the highest ever PM 2.5 level recording" in the country, Dong Liansai a campaigner with environmental group Greenpeace, told AFP news agency. There has been no government confirmation of this assertion. 'Unreasonable' The deterioration in air quality came as the city's coal-powered heating system fired up for the winter. Local media reported delays in the enacting of emergency measures, such as warnings to the public and issuance of stop-work orders to work sites. A Global Times editorial blamed local officials for inexperience in tackling pollution and "inconsistent channels of communication". It also blamed "unreasonable modes of energy consumption and [the] industrial structure". But it also called for public understanding saying that in general, local governments "are still on a learning curve". On the microblogging platform Weibo, Shenyang residents have continued to post pictures of themselves wearing masks and of the city plunged in a hazy gloom, using the hashtag #Shenyang Haze#, as the pollution persisted. "I can't go on living like this, #Shenyang Haze#, if this goes on any longer everyone will probably get cancer," complained user BLS-Christine on Tuesday. Multiple Weibo users shared ghostly images of neon signs "floating" in the air as buildings were rendered nearly invisible by the smog Earlier this year China's environment ministry announced that only eight out of the country's 74 biggest cities had passed the government's basic air quality standards in 2014. Most of the cities found to have the worst air were in the northeast of the country. China is attempting to cut pollution but still relies heavily on coal for its energy and industrial needs.
Another hostage, cafe manager Tori Johnson, was killed by a bullet to the head from gunman Man Haron Monis. His death prompted police to storm the Lindt Chocolate Cafe and kill Monis. The inquest aims to establish whether deaths were avoidable and if it should have been treated as a terrorist event. Eighteen people were taken hostage. The stand-off at the cafe in Martin Place in Sydney's business district on 15 December led to a massive police operation and the shutdown of a large part of the city centre. At the opening of the coroner's inquest in Sydney, Jeremy Gormly, the lawyer assisting the state coroner, said Ms Dawson was "struck by six fragments of a police bullet or bullets which ricocheted from hard surfaces into her body". "I will not detail the damage done to Ms Dawson other than to say that one fragment struck a major blood vessel. She lost consciousness quickly and died shortly afterwards." Australian media reports earlier this month had indicated that Ms Dawson, a 38-year-old barrister and mother of three young children, had died after being hit in the heart and shoulder by fragments from a police bullet. Bomb claim The inquest heard that Monis entered the cafe on the morning of 15 December with a sawn-off shotgun hidden in a plastic bag. He ordered chocolate cake and tea, and asked to speak to the manager, Mr Johnson. After ordering Mr Johnson to lock the cafe, he announced: "This is an attack. I have a bomb." Later that morning, Monis ordered Mr Johnson to phone Australia's emergency number. He ordered the cafe manager to say that Australia was under attack from Islamic State militants and that Monis had planted radio-controlled bombs around the busy Sydney tourist precinct, Circular Quay, and Martin Place - none of which was true. What the inquest wants to know Siege inquest: Key transcript extracts A number of hostages managed to escape as the siege went on, then at 02:00 local time on 16 December, special police stormed the cafe after a police marksman saw Monis shoot the kneeling Mr Johnson in the back of the head. Earlier unconfirmed reports in the Australian press had said Mr Johnson was shot while trying to disarm Monis, but this was not mentioned by the coronial report. The inquest heard that Monis was killed instantly when police entered the cafe. At least two police bullets hit him in the head and 11 other bullets or fragments struck his body. The police used stun grenades, known as flash bangs, as they went in. Monis fired five shots during the entire siege, the inquest heard. The first shot was directed at hostages as they fled the scene. He then shot Mr Johnson. The other bullets were fired when police stormed the cafe. Monis was later found to have had 21 more cartridges in his pocket. 'Horrifying events' Monis, who came to Australia as a refugee from Iran, had a history of religious activism and was on bail at the time of the siege for dozens of sexual assault charges and for being an accessory to the murder of his ex-wife. He claimed to be a cleric and asked his hostages to display an Islamic flag during the siege. However, questions remain about whether he had any links to international militant networks. His partner Amirah Droudis, who is also facing murder charges over his ex-wife, will be represented at the inquest. "Rarely have such horrifying events unfolded so publicly," New South Wales coroner Michael Barnes told the court. "These events have precipitated an outpouring of emotion, anguish, anger, resentment and despair." Outside court, one of the surviving hostages, 82-year-old John O'Brien said: "It's been very upsetting for Tori Johnson's family." Six of Mr Johnson's family members attended the session. None of Ms Dawson's family were present. The inquest has now adjourned. A date has yet to be announced for the next hearing. All the surviving hostages are expected to give evidence. Meanwhile other investigations into the siege are continuing, including a joint federal and New South Wales state government review of why Monis was given asylum and eventually citizenship in Australia and why he was granted bail in 2013. How the 16-hour Sydney siege unfolded
Mr Cameron's spokesman has said "nothing is off the table" when it comes to talks between the pair. Earlier, the prime minister told MPs he would raise the issue of subsidised Chinese steel with his counterpart. Human rights and cyber attacks are also likely to be discussed. The visit comes after Chancellor George Osborne visited China last month, where he said it was the government's intention to make the UK China's "best partner in the west". Mr Osborne also announced earlier this month that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants - a move questioned by some. Mr Cameron told Chinese state TV Mr Xi's visit marks a "very important moment". The Communist leader and his wife Peng Liyuan arrived at Heathrow Airport, where they were greeted on behalf of the Queen by Viscount Hood. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond joined the welcome party. Large red flags of the People's Republic of China are lining The Mall in central London, along with the union jack, in preparation for the official welcome on Horse Guards Parade on Tuesday. During their visit they will meet members of the Royal Family and stay at Buckingham Palace, visit businesses and address members of the Houses of Parliament at Westminster. Amnesty International and other groups concerned with human rights issues in China are expected to protest in St James' Park on Tuesday and it is expected that there will also be a pro-China protest. Steel concerns The start of the visit comes as parts of Caparo steel were put into administration - with unions saying cheap steel from abroad may be a cause. Concerns have already been raised about the impact of cheap steel from China on the European market. Shadow business secretary Angela Eagle said earlier that "anti-competitive dumping... is driving down steel prices." Mr Cameron told the Commons: "We're doing everything we can in Europe to help our steel industry. "That is why we voted in favour of dumping tariffs against the Chinese and we'll do everything we can to help our steel industry, including looking at how we help on high energy usage and the clearances that we need with that. "Will we raise it with the Chinese? Of course, we'll raise all these issues. That is what our relationship with China is all about." Who is China's President Xi? Mr Cameron's spokeswoman also said she expected human rights and the threat faced from cyber attacks to come up during talks. Developing a strong and engaged relationship "means we are able to talk to them... frankly and with mutual respect," she added. China's ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, said on Sunday that his country does not "shy away" from discussing human rights. Mr Liu said he doubted Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would raise human rights abuses during a state banquet at Buckingham Palace this week after Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he would use the visit to discuss the issue. Meanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge has recorded a speech on the illegal ivory trade for Chinese state TV. He also raised the issue with Mr Xi when they met in Beijing earlier this year and his broadcast will form part of a series of programmes called Let's Talk. Also ahead of Mr Xi's visit, former defence secretary Liam Fox questioned the deal with China over nuclear power. Dr Fox said he would be happier if "central elements" of software were produced in the UK. Asked if he was happy with the arrangement, Dr Fox said: "I think we have to question it." China state visit: The timetable Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
The members of the FSB, the Russian intelligence agency, conspired with criminal hackers, according to DOJ officials announcing the charges. Previously, Yahoo said "state-sponsored" hackers were behind the 2014 breach affecting 500 million accounts. The suspects are also alleged to have targeted Google accounts. Hacking was directed at Russian and US government officials, including security, diplomatic and military personnel, according to the DOJ. The indictment also alleged that 30 million Yahoo accounts were commandeered without authorisation for use in a spam campaign. FBI 'most wanted' "We will not allow individuals, groups, nation states, or a combination of them to compromise the privacy of our citizens, the economic interests of our companies, or the security of our country," said acting attorney general Mary McCord, announcing the charges. The suspects were named in a DOJ press release as: Baratov was arrested on 14 March in Canada. One of the alleged hackers has been on of the FBI's most wanted cyber criminals for more than three years, according to acting Att Gen McCord. The suspect in question, Alexsey Belan, was aided by the FSB who - according to the DOJ - provided him with "sensitive FSB law enforcement and intelligence information that would have helped him avoid detection by US and other law enforcement agencies outside Russia". "We would hope [Russia] would respect our criminal justice system and respect these charges," said acting Att Gen McCord, acknowledging the fact that the US does not have an extradition treaty with Russia. "The United Kingdom's MI5 made substantial contributions to the advancement of this investigation," added FBI executive assistant director Paul Abbate. Personal data stolen Yahoo was criticised for the delay in informing users about the 2014 breach. The stolen data included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords, but not credit card data, according to Yahoo. Last year, users were advised to change their passwords. Around eight million UK accounts were believed to have been affected - including some users of BT and Sky email services. "The indictment unequivocally shows the attacks on Yahoo were state-sponsored," Yahoo said in a statement, responding to the DOJ announcement. "We are deeply grateful to the FBI for investigating these crimes and the DOJ for bringing charges against those responsible." The DOJ said that the charges have no connection to the hack on the Democratic National Convention last year.
He will leave the role next month after he fulfils "outstanding commitments", a source close to Mr Blair told the BBC. Mr Blair, who took the role just hours after leaving Downing Street in 2007, has written to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to confirm his decision. He will "remain active" in the region in an informal role, the source said. Mr Blair remains "fully committed to assisting the international community in its work with Israel and the Palestinians to bring about progress on the two-state solution", they said. "He believes that he can best support these efforts through working with the key regional players, the USA, the EU and others, without any formal role." Analysis By Kevin Connolly, BBC Middle East correspondent No-one is going to consider Tony Blair's period as Quartet envoy a resounding success. But it can't be written off as a failure either, largely because of the mandate he was given. The role came with considerable media fanfare, but in truth they were big headlines heralding a modest set of responsibilities. It was the envoy's job to bring economic development to Palestinian areas, and there were some successes on improving freedom of movement and mobile phone services. But everyone knows some sort of political progress has to come - stability, if not a proper deal - before the Palestinian economy can really flourish. That never came on Mr Blair's watch. But it wasn't his remit either. Some felt he was too comfortable with the Israelis and that the Palestinians never felt he put in enough hours at the job. His time may not be ending gloriously but it is difficult to hold Mr Blair to account for failure in a region where very few international diplomats have succeeded. Although he did contribute to the political process, Mr Blair felt the post was "limited" to supporting the Palestinian people on economic development and strengthening institutions, the source said. But despite the "political constraints" of the position, Mr Blair believes "much has been achieved" over the last eight years. The former Labour prime minister feels an "entirely new approach" is required to find a two-state solution, the source added. Mr Blair will now "concentrate on strengthening relations between Israel and the wider Arab world", which he believes could help "underpin international efforts to end the ongoing impasse in the peace process". 'Hope draining away' "He will also focus on encouraging Israel to take measures which will dramatically improve the daily lives of Palestinians in Gaza," the source said "He believes that achieving this progress on the ground is an essential prerequisite to strengthening broader Arab-Israeli relations." James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent, said Mr Blair's time in the role had coincided with "hope draining away throughout the Middle East peace process". He said the Quartet of powers was now likely to examine its own role in the peace process - as well as the future role of another possible envoy. "So little has been achieved - arguably nothing has been achieved - in the Israel-Palestine process in the past decade and more, so I think if the Quartet examines its own usefulness it will certainly think twice before rushing to have a new envoy," our correspondent added.
Mr Bezos is buying the paper and its other print properties in a personal capacity. The Post has been owned by the Graham family for 80 years. "Years of familiar newspaper-industry challenges made us wonder if there might be another owner who would be better for the Post," said Post chief executive, Donald Graham. "Jeff Bezos' proven technology and business genius, his long-term approach and his personal decency make him a uniquely good new owner for the Post." The Washington Post Company also owns Kaplan, a test preparation company, in addition to other properties. Those will stay under the ownership of the Grahams as part of a yet-unnamed entity. The sale is expected to be completed in the next 60 days. Declining circulation The flagship paper, known for its coverage of the Watergate scandal, has suffered in recent years as the internet has hurt advertisement sales and it has struggled to adapt its print coverage to the web. Journalist Carl Bernstein, who, along with Robert Woodward, broke the Watergate story in the 1970s, said he had high hopes the announcement would "represent a great moment in the history of a great institution". He added that it showed "recognition that a new kind of entrepreneurship and leadership, fashioned in the age of the new technology, is needed to lead not just The Post, but perhaps the news business itself". "Jeff Bezos seems to me exactly the kind of inventive and innovative choice needed to bring about a recommitment to great journalism on the scale many of us have been hoping for, while employing all the applicable tools and best sensibilities of a new era and the old," he said. The Post has been "declining in circulation especially among young readers," Horizon Media analyst Brad Adgate told the BBC. Nonetheless, he added: "I always thought this would be a newspaper that would be able to withstand the digital tide because of the name and the prestige. It is, next to the New York Times, the most prestigious paper in the country." According to the Alliance for Audited Media, a newspaper auditing firm, the Washington Post was the seventh most popular daily newspaper in the US this year, with a total circulation of 474,767 - a 6.5% decline on last year. In an open letter posted on the Washington Post's website, Mr Bezos said he would not be leading the paper on a day-to-day basis and sought to reassure nervous employees, but saying he would not seek to change "the values" of the paper. However, he added: "There will, of course, be change at The Post over the coming years...The internet is transforming almost every element of the news business: shortening news cycles, eroding long-reliable revenue sources, and enabling new kinds of competition, some of which bear little or no news-gathering costs." Mr Bezos said he did not have a plan yet for what exactly he thought those changes would be. Faded glory The sale took many by surprise. "We've all been broadsided by the acquisition. There are few things that come as a surprise any more but this one did," said Rebecca Lieb, an industry analyst at the Altimeter Group. "However, when you really start thinking about it, it makes sense - all because of digital," she said, citing Mr Bezos's experience with digital delivery and personalisation at Amazon. In a filing with regulators, the company said, however, that Mr Bezos was not purchasing its other notable online properties: Slate magazine, TheRoot.com, and Foreign Policy. This is the second sale of a major US newspaper in as many days. Over the weekend, the New York Times announced it had sold another iconic newspaper, the Boston Globe, to John W. Henry, the owner of the baseball team the Boston Red Sox, for $70m - a fraction of the $1.1bn the company had paid for the paper in 1993.
By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service economics correspondent That damage is, for the most part, not due to the virus itself so much as efforts to prevent it spreading. There are strict restrictions on moving out of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, a city with a population of 11 million. The lockdown, also now extended to other parts of Hubei province, prevents business-related travel as well as the movement of goods and workers. Fear of the virus also means many people will choose to avoid activities they think might expose them to the risk of infection. So restaurants, cinemas, transport providers, hotels and shops are all quickly feeling the impact. And the timing of the health crisis, during the lunar New Year break, means those industries have been particularly exposed to commercial losses. The New Year holiday was extended for a few days by the national Chinese authorities and there have been longer extensions imposed by some provincial authorities, delaying the return to work for some businesses even longer. Any delay resuming production and selling goods is likely to lead to cash-flow problems, especially for smaller operations. Many companies will have to continue paying bills, including employees' pay. And for manufacturers selling goods abroad, there may be some issues with buyers becoming more reluctant to buy from China. Herbert Lun, who owns Wing Sang Electrical, which makes products such as hair-straighteners and blow-dryers in Guangdong province, told BBC News many companies would not have much slack to take this kind of impact, coming, as it did, on top of the US-China trade war. And the epidemic "will add to the pressure on customers trying to shift their supply chain away from China". The impact is not confined to China. International retailers have closed operations in China - the furniture seller Ikea and the coffee shop chain Starbucks, for example. Several overseas airlines have stopped flights to China and international hotel chains have been offering refunds. And beyond that, there is growing concern about integrated international supply chains. China has a much bigger role in these networks than it did at the time of the last major health problem that emerged from the country - the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) virus 17 years ago. Hyundai, of South Korea, has suspended its car production because of problems with the supply of parts from its operation in China - an early warning sign of possible extensive disruption ahead. China is an important supplier for the global motor industry and the electronics sector. Many mobile phones and computers are made in China or at least have components manufactured there. Financial markets have also felt the effect of the health crisis. Stock markets around the world are lower than they were two weeks ago. China's market fell 8% on the first day of trading after the holiday. There has been a particularly marked impact on the prices of industrial commodities, as China is such an important buyer. Crude oil hit its lowest level in more than a year. It has dropped by about 15% in the past two weeks, reflecting declining demand from China - underlined by reports the country's leading refiner, Sinopec, is cutting back. A group of oil exporting nations is considering production cuts in an effort to reverse the price fall. Copper is also cheaper - by about 13% over the past two weeks. It is an important material for the construction industry, which is also sure to be affected in China. Many of the suppliers of these commodities are emerging and developing economies. It is early days to attempt to quantify the likely economic effects. Much will depend on how well the Chinese authorities are able to contain the virus. But some forecasters have made rather tentative efforts to put some numbers on the impact. One example is the consultancy Oxford Economics which predicts the Chinese economy will grow less than 4% in the first quarter of 2020 from a year earlier. For the full year, the forecast is average growth of 5.6%. For both figures, the previous, pre-virus forecast was 6%. It also expects the global economy to grow slightly less - by 0.2 percentage points - than it would have done otherwise. But Oxford Economic says this is all based on an assumption the "worst case scenario" will be avoided. So there is a risk of the economic damage turning out to be more severe.

The US-based social network said that the attack occurred when employees visited a mobile developer website "that was compromised". Facebook said in a blog post that it was not the only company to have been attacked in this way. More than one billion people use Facebook worldwide. "Last month, Facebook security discovered that our systems had been targeted in a sophisticated attack," the California-based company said. "The attack occurred when a handful of employees visited a mobile developer website that was compromised." Malware was downloaded on to its employees' laptops, the firm said, adding: "As soon as we discovered the presence of the malware, we remediated all infected machines, informed law enforcement, and began a significant investigation that continues to this day." "We have no evidence that Facebook user data was compromised in this attack," Facebook said in its blog post. The firm went on to say that it was "not alone in this attack". "It is clear that others were attacked and infiltrated recently as well. As one of the first companies to discover this malware, we immediately took steps to start sharing details about the infiltration with the other companies and entities that were affected," Facebook said. This is the latest attack by apparently sophisticated hackers targeting high-profile sites. Twitter said earlier this month that the theft of 250,000 users' passwords, as well as usernames, emails and other data, was "not the work of amateurs". The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal have all accused China of "persistently" hacking into their security systems - accusations China denies.
By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website Research in more than 1,000 people has identified a set of proteins in the blood which can predict the start of the dementia with 87% accuracy. The findings, published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, will be used to improve trials for new dementia drugs. Experts warned that the test was not yet ready for doctors' surgeries. Research into treatments for Alzheimer's disease has been plagued by failure. Between 2002 and 2012, 99.6% of trials aimed at preventing or reversing the disease flopped. Doctors believe the failure is down to treating patients when it is already too late, since symptoms appear around a decade after the start of the disease. Identifying patients earlier is one of the priorities for dementia research. Dementia across the globe Blood test The research group, which combines university and industry scientists, looked for differences in the blood of 452 healthy people, 220 with mild cognitive impairment and 476 with Alzheimer's disease. They were able to tell with 87% accuracy which patients with mild cognitive impairment would go on to develop Alzheimer's disease in the next year. "We want to be able to identify people to enter clinical trials earlier than they currently do and that's really what we've been aiming at," said lead researcher Prof Simon Lovestone from the University of Oxford. However, he said it may find a place in doctors' surgeries in the future. "As long as there is no treatment one can question the value of a test, but people come to the clinic because they want to know what's happening to them and I currently can't tell them." He said he was forced to tell patients to come back in a year and see if their memory problems were any worse. Prof Lovestone added: "That's grim, it's horrible, you can only imagine what that's like for patients. "Although I have some real reservations about doing a test, all I can say is there are some people who come to clinics asking precisely that question." Dr Ian Pike, chief operating officer at Proteome Sciences, said: "Having a protein test is really a major step forwards. "[It] will take several years and need many more patients before we can be certain these tests are suitable for routine clinical use, that process can start fairly quickly now." Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, described the study as a "technical tour de force". However, he warned the current accuracy levels risked telling healthy people they were on course to develop Alzheimer's which may lead to anxiety and depression. It is unlikely that the test would be used in isolation if it eventually makes its way into clinics. A positive result could be backed up by brain scans or testing spinal fluid for signs of Alzheimer's. However, Dr Karran did argue this was a step towards making Alzheimer's a preventable disease. "I think it does, but not immediately. "This gives a better way to identify people who will progress to Alzheimer's disease, people who can be entered into clinical trials earlier, I think that will increase the potential of a positive drug effect and thereby I think we will get to a therapy, which will be an absolute breakthrough if we can get there. "It's not a simple journey. We all wish it was."
Weinstein, 67, was convicted in New York City of third-degree rape and first-degree criminal sexual act. He was cleared of the most serious count of predatory sexual assault but faces up to 25 years in prison. He still faces charges in Los Angeles of assaulting two women in 2013. At least 80 women had accused him of sexual misconduct stretching back decades, including actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Uma Thurman and Salma Hayek. The allegations were at the centre of the #MeToo movement that inspired women to go public with misconduct allegations against powerful men. The movie executive once enjoyed phenomenal success with Oscar winners such Pulp Fiction, Good Will Hunting, The King's Speech and Shakespeare in Love. Reports say he was taken to New York's Bellevue Hospital suffering from chest pains after the verdict was announced. He was due to be moved to prison on Riker's Island to await sentencing on March 11. What happened in the New York court? The jury of seven men and five women reached their verdict on Monday morning, the fifth day of deliberations. Weinstein - who denied all charges - was convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping Jessica Mann, a former aspiring actress, in 2013. The judge ordered him sent to jail immediately. But the jury acquitted him on two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carried a potential life sentence, and first-degree rape of Mann. In the minutes after the verdict, Weinstein showed no emotion as he talked to his lead lawyer Donna Rotunno. He will be sentenced on 11 March. The third-degree rape charge in New York is defined as engaging in sexual intercourse with a person who is incapable of consent, or under age 17, or who has not given consent for a reason other than the inability to consent. Prosecutors portrayed Weinstein as a serial predator who used his position of power in Hollywood to manipulate and attack women. The defence team said sex between the movie executive and the accusers was consensual, and that the accusers used the relations to advance their careers. The allegations amounted to "regret renamed as rape", the defence said. Two of the accusers kept in contact with Weinstein and had sex with him after the alleged attacks, they pointed out. How did we get here? How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded What were the allegations in this case? Ms Haleyi, who had worked on one of Weinstein's television productions, said she was assaulted by the producer after he invited her to his Lower Manhattan home. She testified that he backed her into a bedroom, held her down on the bed and forced himself on her. Ms Mann said that she found herself in an "extremely degrading" relationship with him that did not involve intercourse until he raped her in a New York City hotel room in 2013. She said he was a "Jekyll and Hyde" figure who could be charming in public but showed his dark side when they were alone. Another one of Weinstein's accusers, Sopranos actress Annabella Sciorra, told jurors he raped her in her apartment one night in the mid-1990s. Her allegation was too old to be charged as a separate crime, but prosecutors used it in an attempt to demonstrate that the accused was a repeat sexual offender. Following the verdict, Ms Sciorra said: "I spoke for myself and with the strength of the 80-plus victims of Harvey Weinstein in my heart." Three other also women testified they were lured to apparent work meetings with Weinstein, then sexually assaulted. What's the reaction? "The fight is not over," Ms Rotunno told reporters outside the courthouse. "Harvey is unbelievably strong. He took it like a man and he knows we will continue to fight for him and he knows that this is not over." She said her client was disappointed, but "mentally tough". Rose McGowan told the BBC's Newshour programme: "The little girl I was when I was hurt, she's ecstatic...This is a great day. The trash has been taken out." The actress, who was an early Weinstein accuser, added: "The fact that we are white women and attractive and of some means and it still took this many of us to even get him to have one day in court - just tells you…how almost impossible it is to even be heard, period, let alone [get] any kind of conviction." In a joint letter, actresses Ashley Judd, Lucia Evans and Rosanna Arquette and 19 other Weinstein accusers called it "disappointing that today's outcome does not deliver the true, full justice that so many women deserve," but expressed gratitude towards all the women who came forward to speak out against him. What happens next? Weinstein charged with rape in Los Angeles Weinstein 'in tentative $25m deal with accusers'
They confirmed the Islamic State (IS) militant had died in a flat in the Paris suburb of Saint Denis. His body was found riddled with bullets and shrapnel in the apartment. Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said he had received intelligence that Abaaoud had passed through Greece on his return from Syria. It is unclear whether the Belgian had concealed himself among the thousands of migrants arriving in Greece before heading for other EU nations. Friday's gun and suicide bomb attacks in the French capital left 129 people dead and hundreds injured. Key questions remain after attacks One of the other attackers, who blew himself up outside the Stade de France, was traced to Greece by his fingerprints, where he was registered as a migrant. In other developments: Confirming Abaaoud left for Syria last year, Mr Cazeneuve said no EU states had signalled his return. The minister also implicated Abaaoud in four out of six attacks foiled in France since this spring. He was linked to a plot in April to attack a church near Paris. Police are also investigating a possible connection to the attack on a high-speed train from Amsterdam to Paris in August. In Belgium, he had links to an Islamist cell that was broken up in a raid by security forces in the town of Verviers in January which led to the deaths of two gunmen. Police sources told AFP news agency that the tip-off about Abaaoud's presence in Greece had come from Moroccan intelligence. Eight people were arrested and at least two killed in the raid on the property in Saint Denis. Heavily armed police stormed the building after a tip-off that Abaaoud was in Paris. A woman at the flat - reported in French media to be Abaaoud's cousin - died during the raid after activating a suicide vest. The prosecutor's office said it was still unclear whether Abaaoud had blown himself up or not. The 28-year-old was identified from his fingerprints. Mr Cazeneuve told reporters that a non-EU state had alerted France on Monday that Abaaoud had been in Greece. "Everyone must understand it is urgent that Europe wakes up, organises itself and defends itself against the terrorist threat," he said. Abaaoud's movements 2013: Said to have first visited Syria, joining the Islamic State group before slipping back to his home country, Belgium 20 January 2014: Passes through Germany's Cologne-Bonn airport, en route to the Turkish city of Istanbul. Returns to Syria, where he becomes one of the faces of IS propaganda 15 January 2015: His mobile phone is reportedly traced to Greece from calls made to an Islamist cell in Verviers, Belgium 16 November 2015: Three days after the Paris attacks, a foreign intelligence service alerts France that he is back in Europe, having passed through Greece; police receive a tip-off that he is on French territory 18 November 2015: Killed in police raid on Paris suburb of Saint Denis, five days after reportedly heading the attacks in Paris that left 129 people dead Profile of Abdelhamid Abaaoud How the Saint-Denis raid unfolded The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says the identification of Abaaoud raises serious questions for security services. He was high on French and Belgian wanted lists and yet managed to travel from Syria to the heart of Paris without ever leaving a trace. Investigators are still looking for another suspect, Salah Abdeslam, who is believed to have travelled to Belgium after the attacks on Friday night. More on the Paris attacks Special report: In-depth coverage of the attacks and their aftermath Also on Thursday, Belgian police raided properties linked to Bilal Hadfi, who is believed to have blown himself up outside the Stade de France stadium during Friday's attacks. Seven of the arrests were linked to Hadfi while the other two were connected more generally to the Paris attacks, prosecutors said. What is Islamic State? IS is a notoriously violent Islamist group which controls large parts of Syria and Iraq. It has declared its territory a caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law - under its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. What does it want? IS demands allegiance from all Muslims, rejects national borders and seeks to expand its territory. It follows its own extreme version of Sunni Islam and regards non-believers as deserving of death. How strong is IS? IS projects a powerful image, partly through propaganda and sheer brutality, and is the world's richest insurgent group. It has about 30,000 fighters but is facing daily bombing by a US-led multi-national coalition, which has vowed to destroy it. More on Islamic State?

It is known for its expensive tickets, exclusive guest list, and extravagant outfits that are based around a different theme each year. This year, the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, which showcases how Catholicism has influenced fashion throughout history. Celebrities hit the red carpet on Monday night, sporting papal-inspired gowns, chainmail costumes reminiscent of the Crusades and in singer Katy Perry's case - oversized angel wings. The stories behind six of the most captivating outfits "Fashion and religion have long been intertwined, mutually inspiring and informing one another," curator Andrew Bolton said in a statement on The Met's website. "Although this relationship has been complex and sometimes contested, it has produced some of the most inventive and innovative creations in the history of fashion." All images subject to copyright.
Frank-Juergen Weise told the Bild am Sonntag paper that his office would struggle if more people came. But he said he was confident the number of new arrivals would remain within the estimate. More than one million migrants from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa arrived in Germany last year. The German interior ministry says more than 390,000 people applied for asylum in the first six months of this year, but it is not clear how many of these may have arrived in the country in 2015. Mr Weise said Germany would try to get as many of them on the job market as possible. But he said the migrants' integration in German society "would take a long time and cost a lot". A poll this month showed just over half of Germans thought Chancellor Angela Merkel's migrant policy was bad. Support for anti-immigrant groups has risen. On Saturday, members of a far-right movement scaled Berlin's Brandenburg Gate and unfurled a banner to protest against what they called the "Islamisation" of Germany. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
She was represented under a pseudonym in the Roe v Wade case, in what ended up being a landmark and controversial Supreme Court judgement in 1973. Having turned to religion, McCorvey then said being part of the decision to legalise abortion "was the biggest mistake of my life". She also unsuccessfully petitioned the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v Wade. Her death, in a Texas care home, was confirmed to US media by a journalist who had been working on a book on the case. The ruling in January 1973 came after McCorvey, then a 25-year-old single woman under the pseudonym "Jane Roe", challenged the criminal abortion laws in Texas that ruled abortion was unconstitutional, except in cases where the mother's life was in danger. Henry Wade was the Texas attorney general who defended the anti-abortion law. McCorvey first filed the case in 1969 - she was pregnant with her third child and said she had been raped. But the case was rejected and she gave birth. However, in 1973 her appeal made it to the US Supreme Court where, by a vote of seven to two, the justices ruled that the government lacked the power to prohibit abortions. 'Men making decisions about women's bodies' Roe v Wade explained The court's judgement was based on the decision that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy came under the freedom of personal choice in family matters, as protected by the Constitution. The case for abortion The case against Read more: The last big US abortion ruling McCorvey, having revealed her real name in the 1980s, went on to clarify that she had not been raped as she had earlier claimed. She had said so only to get permission for an abortion and speed up her case. By the time the legal challenges to her case were over, her daughter was two and had been given away for adoption. "I'm a simple woman with a ninth-grade education who wants women not to be harassed or condemned," she told the New York Times in 1994, before she went on to denounce abortion. "It's no glamorous thing to go through an abortion. I never had one, but I've worked in three clinics and I know." In an anti-abortion television advert broadcast earlier this decade, she said: "Abortion has eliminated 50 million innocent babies in the US alone since 1973. Abortion scars an untold number of post-abortive mothers, fathers, and families too." Before Roe v Wade, some states had already started to reform or repeal laws on abortion, but women seeking a termination had to do so illegally, at great expense, and often in unsafe conditions. One underground network run by women in Chicago said it performed some 12,000 abortions in the late 1960s and early 70s, before the court ruling was made. In more recent years, the issue has proven to be among the most divisive in US politics. Last month, President Trump signed an executive order banning federal money going to international groups which perform or provide information on abortions. The order, known as the Mexico City Policy, was originally put in place by Ronald Reagan but was rescinded under Bill Clinton. US anti-abortion activists rally in DC Although the policy does not directly affect services in the US, Mr Trump has said he supports an abortion ban at home, where several states maintain restrictions on abortion services. In many parts of America, women have to travel for hours to get an abortion because access to services is limited.
Mr Meng was first reported missing in late September after travelling from Interpol HQ in France to China. His wife has revealed that he sent her a text message with a knife emoji on the day he went missing. Mr Meng is the latest high-profile target to be ensnared in China's sweeping anti-corruption campaign. He is also a vice-minister for public security in the country. In its announcement of the investigation, China's Public Security Ministry said the probe was "correct, wise and shows the determination of [President Xi]'s administration to continue its anti-corruption drive". Interpol is the global policing agency that co-ordinates between police forces around the world, including searches for missing and wanted persons. Interpol's general secretariat oversees the day-to-day work of the 192-member organisation, with the role of the president largely ceremonial. After Mr Meng's disappearance was made public on Friday, speculation had mounted that he had been taken into custody. A number of top Chinese government officials, billionaires and even an A-list celebrity have vanished in recent months. Last week, actress Fan Bingbing, who disappeared in July, emerged with a public apology and a fine of 883 million yuan ($129m; £98.9m) for tax evasion and other offences. But correspondents say that Mr Meng's high-profile position at Interpol was once seen as a prize for Beijing, raising questions about whom he might have angered or what he might have done to be targeted as part of President Xi's anti-corruption blitz. What has Interpol said about the matter? In a statement on Twitter on Sunday, it said it had received Mr Meng's resignation with immediate effect. Under its terms it has appointed senior vice-president Kim Jong-yang of South Korea as acting president. A new president will be elected for the remaining two years of Mr Meng's mandate at the general assembly in Dubai next month. On Saturday, the international police agency urged China to clarify Mr Meng's status, saying it was concerned about the well-being of its president. There has been no word from him on the charges he faces. What did his wife say? French authorities have opened an investigation and have placed Mr Meng's wife under police protection after she received threats. Grace Meng, speaking shortly before China's confirmation of the detention, had told journalists she thought he was in danger. She issued an emotional plea for international help to find her husband. On the day he went missing, she said he had sent her a social media message telling her to "wait for my call", before sending a knife emoji, signifying danger. With her back to the cameras to avoid being identified out of fear for her safety, she held back sobs to read out a statement in Chinese and English. "We are always connected by [our] hearts. He would support me in doing this. The matter belongs to fairness and justice. The matter belongs to the international community. The matter belongs to the people of my motherland." The reach of the Communist Party Analysis by Robin Brant, in Beijing When Meng Hongwei was appointed two years ago, one newspaper here wrote that it would "promote understanding abroad of China's justice system". This is probably not what was envisaged back then. His "resignation" and apparent detention makes it clear that it's the laws of China - and the rules of its governing Communist Party - that trump all else for any government official. Even if they're appointed to a job in France. China's new National Supervision Commission - an anti-corruption agency - said Mr Meng was being investigated for "violation of laws". Importantly it didn't mention - as is often the case with high-profile detentions like this - the charge of "violating party rules". The anti-corruption body has targeted thousands of people in a relentless drive led by President Xi Jinping. There are also rumours that Mr Meng may have been purged because of his links to another senior party figure out of favour with the leadership. Will this affect China's image? The investigation into Mr Meng has raised some concern that international institutions will be reluctant to appoint Chinese officials to high positions - something Beijing has pushed for in recent years. Chinese nationals hold top positions at several global institutions including the UN, IMF, World Bank and Unesco. But Tom Rafferty of the Economist Intelligence Unit in Beijing said while he believes the current case is not likely to affect future appointments, it does have an impact on China's image on the international stage. "There's obviously going to be some bad publicity around this and it's not like China doesn't care about this," he said. "But whatever they want Mr Meng for has in this case trumped their concern for international public opinion." Who is Meng Hongwei? He was elected Interpol president in November 2016, the first Chinese person to take up the post, and was scheduled to serve until 2020. He headed the organisation's Executive Committee, which provides overall guidance and direction. Mr Meng has 40 years of experience in criminal justice and policing in China, notably in the fields of drugs, counter-terrorism and border control. After his election, human rights groups expressed concern that the move could help China pursue political dissidents who have fled the country.
Europol said thousands of vulnerable minors had vanished after registering with state authorities. It warned of children and young people being forced into sexual exploitation and slavery by criminal gangs. Save the Children says some 26,000 child migrants arrived in Europe last year without any family. It is the first time Europol has given a Europe-wide estimate of how many might be missing. What happens to lone child migrants? Migration to Europe explained in graphics Targeting refugees "It's not unreasonable to say that we're looking at 10,000-plus children," Europol's chief of staff told the Observer newspaper. "Not all of them will be criminally exploited; some might have been passed on to family members. We just don't know where they are, what they're doing or whom they are with." Officials in Italy warned in May 2015 that almost 5,000 children had disappeared from asylum reception centres since the previous summer. In October, the authorities in Trelleborg in southern Sweden said about 1,000 unaccompanied refugee children and young adults who arrived in the town in the previous month had since gone missing. Confirming the overall estimate of missing minors, a Europol spokesman said a large proportion may have also disappeared after landing in Greece. The country is the first entry point for most of the 1 million migrants who arrived in Europe by boat in 2015, and authorities have been criticised for failing to register and check the arrivals. Criminal gangs known to be involved in human trafficking in Europe are now targeting refugees, Europol said. There are fears unaccompanied children and young people may be dragged into sex work, slavery and other illegal activity. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) spokesman Leonard Doyle told the BBC the figure of 10,000 missing children was "shocking but not surprising". He said it was "to be expected" that many of these would be caught up in exploitation. "Let's hope now the EU puts the resources into finding these children, helping them and reuniting these children with their families." Exploited and abandoned The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler exposed the plight of vulnerable children arriving in Italy in an investigation last year. Here is an extract: Fabio Sorgoni works for the Italian charity On The Road. He told me that there is a very short window of time to provide unaccompanied minors arriving in Europe with a safe haven. By law, they are allowed out of reception centres during the day, when they easily fall prey to organised crime or individuals looking to exploit them, he said. Few Italian centres have enough translators who speak the children's languages. They do not employ staff experienced in spotting victims of sexual exploitation. Feeling uncertain and unprotected, thousands of children have run away from Italian reception centres, disappearing on to the streets. With no one stepping in or taking responsibility for them, they're left to fend for themselves - doing what it takes to survive. The warning from Europol comes days after the UK government said it would accept more unaccompanied child refugees from Syria and other conflict zones, without giving numbers. However, it said it would not be taking in vulnerable children who had already made it into Europe. On Saturday, at least 39 migrants, including several children, drowned trying to cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. The IOM said on Friday that 244 migrants had drowned in the Mediterranean so far this year, out of 55,568 arrivals. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
He was addressing a huge Russian audience in a live televised phone-in. He also insisted "there are no Russian troops in Ukraine". Moscow denies Western charges that it is directly arming and reinforcing the rebels. Later he said those who had ordered the murder of Boris Nemtsov - one of his leading critics - might never be found. Mr Nemtsov, a prominent opposition politician, was shot dead on 27 February near the Kremlin. Five suspects, all of them Chechens, are in custody. Mr Putin condemned the murder as "disgraceful". Ukraine 'blockade' It was Mr Putin's 13th marathon annual phone-in with the Russian public, and lasted nearly four hours. Mr Putin denied reports that Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko had offered to let Russia have the rebel-held areas in the Donbas region. The rebels reject Kiev's rule and are getting humanitarian aid from Russia, which annexed Ukraine's Crimea region last year. "There are many problems there and we do not see the current Kiev authorities wanting to restore the social sphere, or the economy of Donbas," Mr Putin said. "We see a total blockade of Donbas. One can say that the current Ukrainian authorities are cutting off Donbas by their own hand. That is the problem and tragedy." Tough economic times Mr Putin said he had told business leaders that he did not expect EU-US sanctions - imposed over Russia's actions in Ukraine - to be lifted soon. "We need to use the situation to reach a new level of development," he said. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says such phone-ins are highly choreographed but do reveal Russians' concerns. Russians' real incomes have fallen this year for the first time since Mr Putin came to power. Mr Putin said the Russian economy would take about two years to bounce back from recession, or less as the rouble's value was rising again. He said there were encouraging signs that Russian agriculture was growing and replacing imports of Western food. However, a dairy farmer introduced as "John - a Russian citizen" grilled Mr Putin over the hardship faced by farmers. "You say everything is going well - sorry, that's not true," the farmer said. "I have five children... I need some assurance about their future in Russia. Do you believe the statistics or are they lying?" he asked in English-accented Russian. The farmer is reportedly John Kopiski, originally from the UK, who has lived in Vladimir region for about 15 years. Mr Putin admitted that farmers faced difficulties over low dairy retail prices and that cheap imports of powdered milk from Belarus were part of the problem. "I don't have reason to disbelieve the statistics," he said, adding that the government would have to increase subsidies for farmers. Missiles for Iran Later in the phone-in Mr Putin was asked about Russia's controversial plan to export S-300 air defence missiles to Iran. He insisted that the missiles were not on the UN list of banned exports under the UN sanctions linked to Iran's nuclear programme. He said he made the move because Iran had shown "a desire to reach compromise". The S-300 "doesn't threaten Israel at all, it's exclusively a defensive weapon", he added. Our correspondent says the questions for Mr Putin were clearly vetted, with nothing too critical or too personal. About two million questions came in before the broadcast. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said about 23% of the questions submitted concerned social welfare issues, and the second biggest area of concern was housing and local services.
In his Christmas message the prime minister also praised the volunteers, many of them Christians, who helped to build "what I call the big society". The building of a "big society" was a key part of his 2010 election campaign, but has been rarely mentioned recently. In his message, Labour leader Ed Miliband also praised people who help others who are alone or homeless. In his message issued by 10 Downing Street, Mr Cameron said: "Christmas gives us a space when we can consider the things that we value most - family, friends and fellowship. It is a time for being hopeful for the coming year and to reflect on the one that has passed. "Looking back, 2013 has been a year when our country pulled together to overcome the challenges we face. Together we have made real progress on strengthening our economy and creating more decent jobs so that people can provide for their families. This progress is down to the efforts of millions who go out and work hard every day, putting in the hours, running businesses and keeping our economy going. "And there are those millions who keep on strengthening our society too - being good neighbours, running clubs and voluntary associations, playing their part in countless small ways to help build what I call the big society. Many of these people are Christians who live out to the letter that verse in Acts, that `it is more blessed to give than to receive'. "These people put their faith into action and we can all be grateful for what they do." Miliband's message He added that it had been a significant year for the Christian faith with a new Archbishop of Canterbury and a new Pope, both having "exciting plans to rejuvenate their respective churches, which should inspire Christians around the world". He went on: "For me, this season is also a time to think about the meaning of Christmas - the birth of Jesus Christ and the hope that gives to millions." He also praised servicemen and servicewomen "helping bring peace here and around the world; to their families who cannot be with them; and to all the dedicated men and women in the emergency and caring services who are working hard to support those in need this Christmas". In his Christmas message, Mr Miliband paid tribute to those who would be spending time caring for the lonely and the homeless. "As Christians prepare to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, we should also take time to think of all those alone or suffering at this time of year," he said. "I would like to pay particular tribute to the many people, churches and charities who will be looking after those who are alone or homeless this Christmas time. "We should also pay tribute to those who will be working so that the rest of us have an enjoyable break, especially our medical staff, our police and our armed forces, thank you for your service."
Their wealth rose by 14% over the past year to a record £658bn, it shows. Brothers Sri and Gopi Hinduja, who invest in property, healthcare and oil and gas, top this year's list with £16.2bn - up £3.2bn on 2016. The list includes a record number of British billionaires - 134 - with 14 new ones emerging over the last year. List compiler Robert Watts said: "While many of us worried about the outcome of the EU referendum, many of Britain's richest people just kept calm and carried on making billions." He said a revived stock market had been behind the surge in wealth for the super-rich. 'Equities soared' "We expected to see a chilling effect in the run-up to the EU referendum, but that simply did not materialise," Mr Watts said. "A buoyant stock market usually drives the wealth of rich-listers higher, and since last June equities have soared." Of those in the top 20, only the Weston family - Guy, George and Galen Jr - lost money in the last year. They saw their fortune drop by £500m to £10.5bn because of a fall in the share price of Associated British Foods, in which they have a 20.8% stake. The largest increase in wealth went to steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal, who added more than £6bn to his £13.23bn valuation. However, he remains a long way from his 2008 peak of £27.7bn - a Rich List record. Others on the list include: Mr Watts said: "We're seeing more and more diversity in the composition of the Rich List. "More women, more people from ethnic backgrounds, and more from surprising walks of life, with egg farmers and pet food makers lining up with hedge fund managers and private equity barons." Among those who lost money in this year's list were controversial businessmen Mike Ashley, the founder of Sports Direct, and Sir Philip Green, chairman of the Arcadia Group and the former owner of the collapsed chain store BHS. Ashley's wealth dropped by £270m to £2.16bn after shares in Sports Direct fell, while Sir Philip and Lady Green's wealth dropped by £433m to £2.78bn after he agreed to pay £363m to fund the pensions of former staff at BHS and the value of his stake in Arcadia lowered. It now takes assets of £110m to break into the ranks of the richest 1,000 people in the UK. The figure in 2016 was £103m. The top 20 in the list alone are worth a total of £191.77bn, increasing their wealth by £35.18bn over the past 12 months.
WDBJ7 TV reporter Alison Parker, 24, and cameraman Adam Ward, 27, were killed during an interview in the town of Moneta, the TV station said. A man, apparently a disgruntled former employee of the TV station, uploaded a video of himself shooting the reporter at close range on social media. US media reports say he has subsequently shot himself - but is still alive. Live updates on manhunt for gunman Augusta County Sheriff's Office has named the suspect as Vester Lee Flanagan. Known professionally as Bryce Williams, police said he was a former WDBJ7 staff member. His Twitter and Facebook accounts have now been suspended. The attack took place at a large shopping centre, Bridgewater Plaza, near Smith Mountain Lake. Ms Parker was starting a breakfast TV interview about tourism at the shopping centre when suddenly eight shots rang out, the camera spun and dropped to the ground, and her screams could be heard. The footage then captures what appears to be a fleeting image of the gunman, who is wearing black trousers and a blue top - and holding a handgun. The station said the woman who was being interviewed, Vicki Gardner of the Smith Mountain Lake Regional Chamber of Commerce, had survived the attack but was in hospital and required surgery. "Alison and Adam died this morning at 06:45 shortly after the shots rang out. We do not know the motive or who the suspect or the killer is," the station's president and general manager, Jeffrey Marks, announced on air. "I cannot tell you how much they were loved by the WDBJ7 team... our hearts are broken," he said. He added that the station's building was in lockdown, under police protection. "Police have advised us that as long as this person is on the loose, we should stay in the building. We have police protection," he told the Associated Press news agency. WDBJ7 anchor Chris Hurst revealed that he and Ms Parker had been in a relationship and had planned to marry. "We didn't share this publicly, but @AParkerWDBJ7 and I were very much in love. We just moved in together. I am numb," he said on Twitter. "We were together almost nine months. It was the best nine months of our lives. We wanted to get married. We just celebrated her 24th birthday. "She was the most radiant woman I ever met. And for some reason she loved me back. She loved her family, her parents and her brother." He added that Ms Parker had worked on a regular basis with Mr Ward, and that he was heartbroken for his fiancee, a producer at the station. Alison Parker Adam Ward Who were the two journalists?
The paper said that during the first five months of this year, 385 people - more than two a day - were killed. The number of black people was disproportionately high among the victims, especially unarmed ones. Official statistics rely on self-reported figures from law enforcement agencies. They suggest about 400 people have been killed each year since 2008. The US has seen a number of controversial cases where unarmed black people have been killed by white police officers. Police are allowed to use deadly force when they fear for their lives or the lives of others, however there is currently no reliable way of tracking police shooting deaths. Instead, the government relies on self-reported figures from the nation's 17,000 law enforcement agencies. The figures exclude killings deemed not to have been justified. The Washington Post says it logged every fatal shooting in 2015 by police in the line of duty using interviews, police reports, local media reports and other sources. It found a homicide rate of almost 2.6 per day so far this year - more than double the average 1.1 deaths per day reported in FBI records over the past decade. "These shootings are grossly under­reported," former police chief Jim Bueermann told the newspaper. "We are never going to reduce the number of police shootings if we don't begin to accurately track this information." Among the report's other findings:
Lawyers said the settlement to resolve civil lawsuits and compensate alleged victims was worth about $44m (£34.7m). Mr Weinstein denies sexually harassing or abusing over 75 women. He will stand trial in New York in June on criminal charges brought by two women, including rape. Adam Harris, a lawyer for the studio co-founder Bob Weinstein told a judge that "an economic agreement in principle" had been reached, the Associated Press news agency reports. He added: "I personally am very optimistic." Mr Weinstein's team later told the Wall Street Journal that the size of the settlement would be approximately $44m. Actress Ashley Judd, one of the first women to come forward, tweeted that her separate legal case against Mr Weinstein was ongoing and that she intended to take him to trial. Who is Harvey Weinstein? The 67-year-old is one of Hollywood's most famous producers and has worked on a number of award-winning films, including Shakespeare in Love, The King's Speech and The Artist. In total, the films he worked on have generated over 81 Oscars since 1999 and founded the Miramax entertainment company in the 1970s, which initially focused on art-house films. In 2005, he split from Miramax and founded Weinstein Co, alongside his brother Bob. In 2017, Quartz reported that Mr Weinstein had become so powerful in Hollywood that he had been thanked as many times as God in Oscar acceptance speeches. How did the scandal unfold? In October 2017, the New York Times published a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein. Actresses Rose McGowan and Ms Judd were among the first women to come forward. The accusations include forcing women to massage him and watch him naked. He also allegedly promised to help some women advance their careers in return for sexual favours. The film producer issued an apology acknowledging he had "caused a lot of pain" - but denied allegations that he harassed female employees over nearly three decades. The outcry against Mr Weinstein led to the #MeToo movement, which has seen hundreds of women accusing high-profile men in business, government and entertainment of sexual abuse and harassment. As the accusations mounted, his company Weinstein Co dismissed him and filed for bankruptcy. What would be in the deal? The $44m sum would be divvied among a number of accusers, their attorneys and attorneys for some of the defendants. The accusers, their lawyers, as well as former Weinstein Company employers and creditors would have $30m split among them, according to US media reports. The remaining $14m would be allocated for the legal fees of Mr Weinstein's associates, including former board members of his production company who were named as defendants in lawsuits. The names of the women involved in the settlement have not been released. The objective of the deal is to reach a global settlement of all civil suits filed against Mr Weinstein in the US, UK and Canada, the Wall Street Journal reported. Some of the plaintiffs involved in the deal have balked at the settlement amount, potentially undermining the deal, Variety reported. Mediation is expected to continue next week. So far, there have reportedly been more than 11 separate mediation sessions between the parties, amounting to about 133 hours. A 15 May court filing described the process as "highly adversarial". The settlement is a civil matter so will have no bearing on the pending criminal cases against the former movie mogul. Mr Weinstein is due to go on trial in New York on 3 June on five charges of sexually assaulting two women. He has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. If found guilty, he could spend the rest of his life in prison.
At the end of Tuesday, the firm said sales had reached 57.1 billion yuan, and that it had shipped 278 million orders - 43% of which were placed on mobile devices. Last year, Alibaba recorded sales of $5.75bn, shipping 150 million packages. Singles' Day is the world's biggest online retail sales day. It compares with "Cyber Monday" in the US, the Monday after Thanksgiving, which is also marketed as a big online shopping day. "You're seeing the unleashing of the consumption power of the Chinese consumer," said Alibaba Group's executive vice chairman, Joe Tsai. "We really are witnessing history here because we are seeing the shift of the economy from focused on the state sector to consumption." Growing market Alibaba had said it expected to break sales records during the annual event, offering big discounts to boost sales. "I bet the number [of goods bought] is going to be scary," said Alibaba's executive chairman Jack Ma last week. He estimated that 200 million packages would be shipped from orders made during the day. The company, which recently listed on the New York Stock Exchange, surpassed that number by 18:00 Beijing time. Analysis: Celia Hatton, Beijing correspondent, BBC News. When did an obscure holiday devoted to single people, a kind of anti-Valentine's Day, become China's biggest shopping day of the year? Many in China find the transition baffling. "November 11 used to be 'Singles' Day'. Then it became the Shopping Day, and now it's Couples' Shopping Day," complains one user on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. "Looking across the globe and over the years, there's never really been a day dedicated to single people." Others point out that China's biggest online shopping platform, Alibaba, engineered the change. Alibaba trademarked the term "Double-11", a popular term describing the November 11th holiday, in 2012. The website earns a significant chunk of its profits on that day. "They say behind every successful man, there's a woman quietly supporting him. Behind Jack Ma, [Alibaba's founder], there're tens of millions of female shopaholics," jokes one Weibo user. Frustration lingered in the background of many Weibo forums. Shoppers complained the online deals were too good, tempting them to spend money they didn't have. "Please Singles' Day, can you pass by quickly?," reads a typical comment. "I didn't think I needed anything until today when I feel like I need everything I see. I'm so helpless!" Singles' Day in China was adopted by Alibaba in 2009 to boost sales, but dates back to at least 1993, when students at Nanjing University are believed to have chosen the date as an anti-Valentine's Day where single people could buy things for themselves. Since then, it has gone on to become a massive day of sales for China's fast growing e-commerce market. The market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 25% over the next few years, from $390bn in 2014 to $718bn in 2017, according to a recent study released by management consulting firm AT Kearney. This year's Singles' Day online sales event has attracted the participation of more than 27,000 global brands, including Japanese label Muji, Spanish clothing retailer Desigual and American outdoor clothing label The North Face. Challenges? "Lots of clients from the brands side have for the first time, approached the Singles' Day as an event on its own, and earmarked it as a significant retail operation, as major as Christmas and the Chinese New Year," said Shaun Rein from China Market Research in Shanghai. However, despite Alibaba's recent successful share sale and the strong performance of this year's Singles' Day, Mr Rein says Alibaba still faces challenges. He notes that while 35% of e-commerce transactions in China come from mobile devices, Alibaba is lagging slightly behind, with 31% of its sales generated from mobiles.
Aspiring citizens will undergo tougher tests on their English language skills and ability to demonstrate "Australian values", PM Malcolm Turnbull said. Applicants must also have completed four years as a permanent resident - three years longer than at present. The new process will require parliamentary approval before it is implemented. The move comes two days after Australia unveiled stricter visa requirements for skilled workers from overseas. Mr Turnbull said the changes would ensure that migrants were better integrated into the community. "It is important that they understand that they are making a commitment to our Australian values," he said. What are the changes? In explaining what constituted "Australian values", Mr Turnbull said migrants must demonstrate support for religious freedom and gender equality. "Respect for women and children ... that is a key Australian value," he said, adding domestic violence would not be tolerated. Other changes to the citizenship process include: When asked about reports that applicants would be quizzed on whether they supported forced child marriage or female genital mutilation, Mr Turnbull said it was important to "reinforce our values". "If we believe that respect for women and children [is an Australian value]... then why should that not be made a key part, a fundamental part, a very prominent part, of our process to be an Australian citizen?" Tightening rules The requirements would apply to all new applications for citizenship, the government said. On Tuesday, the government said it would replace a controversial visa scheme to make it harder for foreign nationals to work in Australia. Mr Turnbull said both announcements had been made in the national interest. The opposition Labor Party accused Mr Turnbull of making announcements for political gain. "It seems a little odd to me that you would actually ask people whether or not they are going to obey the law when they already pledge to obey the law," said Labor senator Penny Wong.
Hundreds of babies were born in Brazil last year with microcephaly, a syndrome where children are born with unusually small heads. The defects coincided with a spike in Zika infections, leading experts to suspect the mosquito-borne virus. Research has now affirmed those experts' suspicions, the CDC said. "This study marks a turning point in the Zika outbreak. It is now clear that the virus causes microcephaly," said Dr Tom Frieden, the head of the CDC. More on the Zika crisis: Microcephaly: Why it is not the end of the world What you need to know Key questions answered about the virus and its spread Travel advice Countries affected and what you should do The mosquito behind spread of virus What we know about the insect Abortion dilemma Laws and practices in Catholic Latin America On Monday, US health officials warned the Zika outbreak could have more of an effect on the United States and called for additional funding to combat the virus. "Everything we know about this virus seems to be scarier than we initially thought," said Dr Anne Schuchat of the CDC. Zika virus was first diagnosed in 1947 in Uganda, but symptoms have typically been mild, including rash, joint pain and fever. The current outbreak started in 2015 in Brazil and the symptoms have been much more severe. Nearly 200 babies have died as result of the virus. Researchers are interesting learning why some cases of the virus result in birth defects while others do not. Some women who were infected with Zika while pregnant gave birth to apparently healthy children. There have been 346 confirmed cases of Zika in the continental United States, according to the CDC, all associated with travel. CDC officials said the findings do not change the agency's earlier guidance to pregnant women. The CDC has discouraged pregnant women from travelling to places where the Zika virus is spreading, mostly in Latin America and the Caribbean. Dr Frieden said intensive research was under way to find out much more about the mosquito-borne virus and to develop a vaccine for it, although he warned that that could still be years away. This is the first time that mosquito bites have caused birth defects, Dr Frieden said. The virus can be transmitted by sexual contact as well.
By Judith BurnsBBC News education reporter The gap between income and expenditure for a typical student amounts to more than £7,600 according to NUS analysis. The union compared the cost of living and studying for the 39-week 2013-14 academic year with typical income from government grants and loans. The government said it was targeting support at those who needed it most. Rent, bills and other outgoings continue to rise year after year above the rate of inflation but grants and loan rates were frozen this year and will only rise by 1% next year, says the union. It estimates that a student living outside London will pay an average of £21,440 in tuition fees, books, equipment, rent, travel and other living expenses. Against this, they have a potential income of £13,747 composed of their tuition fee loan plus maintenance loans and the grants available to those on average and low incomes. This leaves a shortfall of £7,693. In London, higher rents mean students typically spend £23,187 says the union - but they are also eligible for a higher maintenance loan of £6,090 though this still leaves them with a shortfall of £7,654, says the union. The union adds that some students from less well-off families who are eligible for grants are facing an additional squeeze as the level at which they can claim maximum support has remained at a household income of £25,000 since 2008. NUS president Toni Pearce said: "Those who do not have the rare luxury of resorting to the 'bank of mum and dad' are increasingly being driven to work full-time alongside study where jobs can be found, or worse still, into the arms of predatory pay day lenders just to make ends meet. "We need a financial support system that ensures students get what the support they need, when they need it." A spokeswoman for the Department for Business Innovation and Skills said the government's student finance package was designed to target support at students from the poorest households. "This year, students from the lowest income households can access over £7,100 of living-cost support, of which over £3,350 does not have to be repaid. "The government also provides additional, non-repayable support to students in specific circumstances, such as students with children and disabled students. "Scholarships and bursaries are also available from most universities, and students in hardship can apply for additional support through the Access to Learning Fund."
Writing in the New York Times, Jolie said she had the surgery last week as she carries a gene that gave her a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer. Two years ago, Jolie, whose mother died from cancer, had a double mastectomy. "It is not easy to make these decisions," she said. "But it is possible to take control and tackle head-on any health issue." Jolie, who is married to Hollywood actor Brad Pitt, elected to have her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed after a check-up two weeks ago. In the article, titled Angelina Jolie Pitt: Diary of a Surgery, she said a blood test revealed "a number" of elevated inflammatory markers that could be a sign of early cancer, and was told to see a surgeon immediately. "I went through what I imagine thousands of other women have felt. I told myself to stay calm, to be strong, and that I had no reason to think I wouldn't live to see my children grow up and to meet my grandchildren," Jolie wrote. "I called my husband in France, who was on a plane within hours. The beautiful thing about such moments in life is that there is so much clarity. You know what you live for and what matters. It is polarizing, and it is peaceful." Further tests revealed Jolie was free of a tumour, but elected to have her ovaries removed after consulting doctors. Her mother, grandmother and aunt all died of the disease. "My doctors indicated I should have preventive surgery about a decade before the earliest onset of cancer in my female relatives," wrote Jolie. Analysis by Michelle Roberts, Health editor Angelina Jolie carries a 'faulty' gene, called BRCA1, which sharply increases her risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Her doctors estimated she had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer in her lifetime unless she underwent surgery In 2013, the award-winning actress had both breasts removed to cut her risk of breast cancer And now two years later, she has had both ovaries and fallopian tubes removed These preventive steps greatly decrease her lifetime risk of cancer But the surgery does not completely guarantee that cancer will not develop - it is impossible to remove all of the at-risk tissue Both men and women who inherit faulty BRCA1, whether or not they go on to develop cancer themselves, have a 50:50 chance of passing the gene on to their sons or daughters "My mother's ovarian cancer was diagnosed when she was 49. I'm 39." Writing about the procedure, saying: "It is a less complex surgery than the mastectomy, but its effects are more severe. It puts a woman into forced menopause." Jolie, who is also a director and UN envoy, will now take hormone replacements. "Regardless of the hormone replacements I'm taking, I am now in menopause," Jolie said. 'We applaud decision' "I will not be able to have any more children, and I expect some physical changes. But I feel at ease with whatever will come, not because I am strong but because this is a part of life. It is nothing to be feared." Charity Ovarian Cancer Action has praised Jolie's decision and "bravery". "We applaud Angelina Jolie's decision to announce that she has had preventative surgery for ovarian cancer and are anticipating another wave of the 'Angelina Effect', which saw a dramatic increase in the number of women referred for genetic testing after Angelina announced that she had undergone a double mastectomy in 2013," said Katherine Taylor, the charity's acting chief executive. "While all women in the UK have a one in 54 chance of developing ovarian cancer, for those with a mutation in their BRAC1/2 genes, like Angelina Jolie, the risk increases to one in two. "If women know they have BRCA gene mutations, they can choose to take action before cancer develops, much like Angelina has. Her bravery to announce this news publicly could save lives." Jolie, who is married to actor Brad Pitt, has six children, three of whom are adopted. The Oscar-winning Hollywood star added: "It is not possible to remove all risk, and the fact is I remain prone to cancer. I will look for natural ways to strengthen my immune system. I feel feminine, and grounded in the choices I am making for myself and my family. "I know my children will never have to say: "Mom died of ovarian cancer."
Britain's highest court said seven judges would hear the case in February. Mr Assange, who remains on conditional bail in the UK, is wanted by Swedish authorities for questioning over allegations of sexual assault. The 40-year-old Australian denies the allegations and claims they are politically motivated. The High Court previously approved his extradition, a decision that Mr Assange argues was unlawful. The Swedish authorities are seeking to put him on trial on accusations of raping one woman and "sexually molesting and coercing" another in Stockholm in August 2010. Mr Assange's Wikileaks website published a mass of material from leaked diplomatic cables embarrassing several governments. The US Army analyst suspected of leaking the documents appeared in an American military court on Friday, where he faces 22 charges of obtaining and distributing government secrets. Bradley Manning made his first appearance in a courthouse in Maryland. He faces a court martial next year and, if convicted, could face life in prison. The US government has already said it will not seek the death penalty, which is the maximum sentence for "aiding the enemy", one of the charges faced by Mr Manning. 'Great importance' Earlier this month in the UK, two High Court judges, Sir John Thomas and Mr Justice Ouseley, decided that Mr Assange had raised a question on extradition law "of general public importance" and gave him 14 days to ask the Supreme Court for a final UK ruling. On Friday, a Supreme Court spokesman said its justices had agreed to hear the case "given the great public importance of the issue raised, which is whether a prosecutor is a judicial authority". He said: "A panel of three Supreme Court Justices - Lord Hope, Lord Mance and Lord Dyson - has considered the written submissions of the parties; this is the court's usual practice for considering applications for permission to appeal. "The Supreme Court has granted permission to appeal and a hearing has been scheduled for two days, beginning on 1 February 2012." The Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement: "If, after the Supreme Court has heard the case, it dismisses Mr Assange's appeal, then his only further remedy is to apply immediately to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which will respond within 14 days. "If it confirms that it does not agree to take the case then that is an end of the matter." The CPS said if the court in Strasbourg did decline to take the case then Mr Assange would be extradited to Sweden as soon as practicable.
While reaffirming its current debt rating, the agency warned that reforms were needed to avoid a downgrade. Moody's said the change in outlook was based on expectations that Beijing's fiscal strength would continue to decline. The negative outlook comes on the heels of fresh data suggesting China's economy is continuing to lose steam. Moody's said it was concerned over China's incomplete implementation of much needed reforms. High debt burden "Without credible and efficient reforms, China's GDP growth would slow more markedly as a high debt burden dampens business investment and demographics turn increasingly unfavourable," Moody's said in a note. "Government debt would increase more sharply than we currently expect." But the ratings agency did confirm China's current Aa3 rating, saying that there was still time to address the current economic imbalances and implement reforms. Just one week ago, China sought to assure the global economic community over the strength of its economy. At the G20 meeting in Shanghai, the country's finance minister Lou Jiwei insisted Beijing could tackle the pressures it is currently facing. China's economy, the second-biggest in the world, is growing at the slowest rate in 25 years as it attempts to move from an export-led nation to one led by consumption and services. The slowdown in China's economy has created considerable uncertainty in financial markets and has led to sharp falls in commodity prices.
By Chris FoxTechnology reporter Many customers have long suspected that Apple slows down older iPhones to encourage people to upgrade. The company has now said it does slow down some models as they age, but only because the phones' battery performance diminishes over time. Apple said it wanted to "prolong the life" of customers' devices. The practice was confirmed after a customer shared performance tests on Reddit, suggesting their iPhone 6S had slowed down considerably as it had aged but had suddenly sped up again after the battery had been replaced. "I used my brother's iPhone 6 Plus, and his was faster than mine? This is when I knew something was wrong," wrote TeckFire. Technology website Geekbench then analysed several iPhones running different versions of the iOS operating system and found some of them did indeed appear to have been deliberately slowed down. What was Apple's response? Apple has now confirmed that it made changes to iOS to manage ageing lithium-ion batteries in some devices, since the batteries' performance diminishes over time. "Lithium-ion batteries become less capable of supplying peak current demands when in cold conditions, [when they] have a low battery charge or as they age over time, which can result in the device unexpectedly shutting down to protect its electronic components," the company said. "Last year, we released a feature for iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE to smooth out the instantaneous peaks only when needed to prevent the device from unexpectedly shutting down during these conditions. "We've now extended that feature to iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2, and plan to add support for other products in the future. "Our goal is to deliver the best experience for customers." Why do lithium-ion batteries degrade? Lithium batteries degrade over time because of what happens during the charging and discharging cycle. During both those events, lithium ions migrate through the material forming the battery. Studies using electron microscopes have shown that each time the ions do this they make tiny changes to the physical structure of that electrolyte. The effect is like "rust creeping unevenly across steel", according to one scientist who has studied the phenomenon. The changes effectively erode the material so it can hold less of a charge and can hamper its ability to provide a steady power supply. Higher voltages make the erosion happen more quickly, as do higher temperatures. Should Apple have told customers? "By choosing to implement this quietly, it appears more nefarious than it really is. That doesn't engender trust," wrote developer and blogger Nick Heer. "Apple has long been very good about managing expectations… this is an instance where they blew it. Needlessly, I think." Replacing an old battery in one of the affected models should return the phone to its former speed. Doing so costs £79 in the UK and $79 (£59) in the US. "They should be more transparent about it," said Chris Green from the tech consultancy Bright Bee. "You're taking away performance that somebody has paid for. If you're going to slow down the phone over time, you should explain why it is happening, so people understand it is ultimately for their benefit. "But I do see where they're coming from. By slowing the phone, it does help mitigate the problem of the diminishing battery." You might also be interested in: Analysis by Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent It is a combination of urban myth and conspiracy theory - the idea that Apple builds planned obsolescence into the iPhone, slowing down older models to make you splash out on an upgrade. Now it turns out to be true - the slowing down part, if not the motive behind it. Apple's explanation that it is all about managing the performance of ageing batteries seems quite reasonable. After all, the fact that the lithium-ion batteries that power mobile phones degrade over time is well known and owners of other leading smartphones also complain of poor battery life after a few years. But what will frustrate and anger many iPhone users is Apple's lack of transparency. The software tweak at the heart of this story happened last year and rumours about the deliberate downgrading of performance have been bubbling for weeks. But it was only a couple of days after a software developer showed exactly what was happening that Apple finally came out and explained. Here is a company that is - as any journalist can attest - fanatical about controlling the message about its products. It has also benefitted from the devotion over the years of customers who are more like fans. But maybe it is time for Apple to show a bit more honesty in that relationship.
The New York Police Department is looking into an allegation dating from 2004 and is reviewing whether there are any additional complaints. London's Met Police has received an allegation of sexual assault in the London area in the 1980s. Weinstein has "unequivocally denied" any allegations of non-consensual sex. US actress Rose McGowan took to Twitter on Thursday to allege that she was raped by Weinstein. In a series of tweets addressed to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, McGowan alleged she had told Amazon Studios she had been assaulted by Weinstein. Amazon later said in a statement that its studio head, Roy Price, had been put on "leave of absence" and that it was reviewing projects it had with the Weinstein Company. Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister reiterated on Thursday: "Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein." The New York Police Department said it was "looking to speak" to an individual who had made an allegation dating from 2004. Assistant Commissioner J Peter Donald said: "Based on information referenced in published news reports, the NYPD is conducting a review to determine if there are any additional complaints relating to the Harvey Weinstein matter. "No filed complaints have been identified as of this time." The force also appealed for anyone with information to come forward. The Metropolitan Police, meanwhile, said it had been passed the allegation of sexual assault by Merseyside Police. A Merseyside Police statement said it "can confirm a report was received at 8.40am on Wednesday (11 October 2017) of an alleged sexual assault in the London area in the 1980s". The investigations come as more women publicly accuse Weinstein of inappropriate behaviour, sexual harassment or assault. British actress Kate Beckinsale is one of the latest, saying she had an encounter with him aged 17, at the Savoy Hotel in London. The Underworld star said on Instagram she was told to go to his room, where he "opened the door in his bathrobe". "After declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed. "A few years later he asked me if he had tried anything with me in that first meeting. I realised he couldn't remember if he had assaulted me or not," she said. British actress and model Cara Delevingne also said he tried to kiss her as she tried to leave a hotel room. Emma Thompson told BBC Two's Newsnight programme she found him to be a "bully" when his company Miramax owned the rights to her film Nanny McPhee. She said she did not know about the allegations of sexual impropriety but added: "They don't surprise me at all and they're endemic to the system anyway. "I don't think you can describe him as a sex addict. He's a predator. That's different." Thompson said there are "many" others like him in Hollywood. "Maybe not to that degree. Do they have to all be as bad as him to make it count?" US actress Jane Fonda told the BBC's Hardtalk programme that his alleged victims did not come forth sooner "because he's powerful, because they're scared". "Most of these women were in their 20s when it happened. Vulnerable. "Afraid that if they say anything or do anything that it'll ruin their career," she said. She added that she wished she had been "braver" by going to the authorities when she first heard the allegations "about a year ago". Ms Hofmeister has said Weinstein "obviously can't speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. "Mr Weinstein has begun counselling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path." Three women earlier accused Weinstein of rape in an investigative article in The New Yorker magazine. They are Italian actress and director Asia Argento, former aspiring actress Lucia Evans and a third woman who was anonymous. 'I've got to get help' Speaking on Wednesday, Weinstein said: "We all make mistakes - second chance I hope." He told TMZ: "Guys I'm not doing OK but I'm trying; I've got to get help. I'm hanging in - I'm trying my best." TMZ reported he was heading to Arizona to a treatment facility. As he departed in a car, the 65-year-old made a plea for fair treatment from reporters, saying: "I've always been loyal to you guys... I've been a good guy." In other developments, the hosts of the Oscars are to hold emergency talks this weekend to consider Weinstein's future role. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said the allegations of sexual assault against Weinstein were "repugnant". 'Unequivocal condemnation' Bafta, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, has already suspended his membership. A statement has also been issued by Cannes Film Festival, which Weinstein attended many times. President Pierre Lescure said the festival had been "dismayed to learn of the accusations". "These actions point to a pattern of behaviour that merits only the clearest and most unequivocal condemnation," he said.

The announcement, by the archbishop of Boston, follows a meeting between the Pope and his eight cardinal advisers. It comes days after the Vatican refused a UN request for information on alleged abuse by priests, nuns or monks. One of the main Italian associations of clerical abuse survivors has said it has "little trust" in the Vatican. Pope Francis has said dealing with sex abuse is vital for the Church's credibility. Earlier this week the Pope expressed his compassion for the many victims of sex abuse by priests around the world. Scandal Cardinal Sean O'Malley, the archbishop of Boston, said the proposed panel of experts could provide codes of conduct for clergymen, guidelines for Church officials and better checks for would-be priests. "Up until now there has been so much focus on the judicial parts of this but the pastoral part is very, very important. The Holy Father is concerned about that," he said. "We feel that having the advantage of a commission of experts who will be able to study these issues and bring concrete recommendations for the Holy Father and the Holy See will be very important." He added that the move was in line with the approach of the former Pope, Benedict XVI, who referred to the "filth" in the Catholic Church. Pope Benedict was, however, accused of failing to do enough to address the problem. The Commission will keep the Pope informed about programmes in place for the protection of children, will formulate suggestions for new initiatives, the Vatican said in a statement. The archdiocese of Boston was the centre of a child sexual abuse scandal involving Catholic priests in the US in 2002. It ultimately led to the resignation of the archbishop at the time. The Catholic Church has faced a raft of allegations of child sex abuse by priests around the world and criticism over inadequate responses by bishops. Earlier this year the Pope strengthened Vatican laws on child abuse, broadening the definition of crimes against minors to include sexual abuse of children. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child put a wide-ranging questionnaire to the Holy See - the city state's diplomatic entity - last July, asking for detailed information about the particulars of all sexual abuse cases notified to the Vatican since 1995. The Vatican refused, saying the cases were the responsibility of the judicial systems of countries where abuse took place. Vatican officials are due to be questioned about child abuse, among other issues, by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in January.
Anton Siluanov made the comments on Monday at an international financial and economic forum in Moscow. Reports on Monday suggested Russia could cut its oil production by about 300,000 barrels a day in an attempt to support the oil price. Opec members meet in Vienna this week where falling prices will be discussed. Vladimir Putin has said that Russia could suffer "catastrophic consequences" from sanctions, the falling oil price and the sliding rouble, while claiming they would have knock-on effects for other countries. "The modern world is interdependent. It's far from guaranteed that sanctions, the steep fall in oil prices and the loss of value of the national currency will lead to negative results or catastrophic consequences only for us," the Russian president told TASS, the official news agency, on Sunday. The European Union and the United States imposed sanctions on Russia following its annexation of the Crimea region in Ukraine and its alleged involvement in eastern Ukraine. Pressure Member of the Opec oil cartel may decide to cut production to support prices. Brent crude was trading at $80.25 a barrel on Monday, down 11 cents, while US crude was 10 cents lower at $76.41. Iran, Libya and Venezuela have urged other Opec members to support oil prices by reducing output, although Kuwait has said that a cut was unlikely. The oil price has been falling since the summer on abundant global supply, partly due to the US shale boom, and lower demand in Europe and Asia. Brent crude has fallen by more than a third and hit a four-year low of $76.76 a barrel on 14 November. Daniel Bathe, of Lupus alpha Investment, said: "The market would question the credibility of Opec and its influence on global oil markets if there were no cut." Saudi Arabia, Opec's biggest producer and exporter, has sent mixed messages about a possible cut. Olivier Jakob, an analyst at Petromatrix, said the Saudis could be influenced by the conclusion of talks about Iran's nuclear programme in Vienna on Monday, which are being extended until next summer. Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said last week that Moscow was considering cutting its oil output, but said the measure had yet to be agreed. The rouble gained more than 2% against both the US dollar and euro on Monday, helped by the slight recovery in oil prices. The currency has fallen by almost 30% against the dollar this year. Russia's central bank had been spending billions in a bid to prop up the rouble, but said earlier this month that it would limit its intervention.
By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website Its report said 50g of processed meat a day - less than two slices of bacon - increased the chance of developing colorectal cancer by 18%. Meanwhile, it said red meats were "probably carcinogenic" but there was limited evidence. The WHO did stress that meat also had health benefits. Cancer Research UK said this was a reason to cut down rather than give up red and processed meats. And added that an occasional bacon sandwich would do little harm. What is processed meat? Processed meat has been modified to either extend its shelf life or change the taste and the main methods are smoking, curing, or adding salt or preservatives. Simply putting beef through a mincer does not mean the resulting mince is "processed" unless it is modified further. Processed meat includes bacon, sausages, hot dogs, salami, corned beef, beef jerky and ham as well as canned meat and meat-based sauces. It is the chemicals involved in the processing which could be increasing the risk of cancer. High temperature cooking, such as on a barbeque, can also create carcinogenic chemicals. In the UK, around six out of every 100 people get bowel cancer at some point in their lives. If they were all given an extra 50g of bacon a day for the rest of their lives then the risk would increase by 18% to around seven in 100 people getting bowel cancer. "So that's one extra case of bowel cancer in all those 100 lifetime bacon-eaters," argued Sir David Spiegelhalter, a risk professor from the University of Cambridge. How bad? The WHO has come to the conclusion on the advice of its International Agency for Research on Cancer, which assesses the best available scientific evidence. It has now placed processed meat in the same category as plutonium, but also alcohol as they definitely do cause cancer. However, this does not mean they are equally dangerous. A bacon sandwich is not as bad as smoking. "For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal (bowel) cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed," Dr Kurt Straif from the WHO said. Estimates suggest 34,000 deaths from cancer every year could be down to diets high in processed meat. Red meat risk In context 21% of bowel cancers are caused by processed or red meat 86% of lung cancers are caused by tobacco 19% of all cancers caused by tobacco compared to 3% of all cancers ascribed to red or processed meat That is in contrast to one million deaths from cancer caused by smoking and 600,000 attributed to alcohol each year. Red meat does have nutritional value too and is a major source of iron, zinc and vitamin B12. However, the WHO said there was limited evidence that 100g of red meat a day increased the risk of cancer by 17%. An eight ounce steak is 225g. The WHO said its findings were important for helping countries give balanced dietary advice. Little harm Prof Tim Key, from the Cancer Research UK and the University of Oxford, said: "This decision doesn't mean you need to stop eating any red and processed meat, but if you eat lots of it you may want to think about cutting down. "Eating a bacon bap every once in a while isn't going to do much harm - having a healthy diet is all about moderation." Dr Teresa Norat, one of the advisors to the WHO report and from Imperial College London, said there were many factors causing bowel cancer. She told BBC News website: "People should limit consumption of red meat and avoid consuming processed meat, but they should also have a diet rich in fibre, from fruit and vegetables and maintain an adequate body weight throughout life and limit the consumption of alcohol and be physically active." The industry body the Meat Advisory Panel said "avoiding red meat in the diet is not a protective strategy against cancer" and said the focus should be alcohol, smoking and body weight.
For girls in particular, they found the longer spent watching TV, the more likely children were to put on weight. Researchers say there is now an urgent need to see if similar patterns exist with laptops and mobile phones. Experts said high levels of screen time exposed children to a damaging combination of risks to health. 'Watch and weight' Published in the International Journal of Obesity, the study analysed data from more than 12,000 young children in the UK. Scientists found more than half the children had TVs in their bedrooms at the age of seven. Parents were also asked to rate how many hours a day children generally spent watching TV. Later, when the children were 11, researchers plotted their body mass index (a ratio of height and weight) and looked at the percentage of body fat. Girls who had TVs in their bedrooms at the age of seven were 30% more likely to be overweight when they were 11, compared to children who did not have TVs in their bedrooms. For boys, the risk was increased by about 20%. Researcher Dr Anja Heilmann, said: "Our study shows there is clear link between having a TV in the bedroom as a young child and being overweight a few years later." Less sleep Researchers say they cannot be sure why the link between TVs and being overweight exists, but suggest it may be down to children getting less sleep when watching TV in their bedrooms or snacking in front of their screens. And they hypothesise that the stronger link between the hours girls spend watching TV and being overweight could be influenced by girls being less likely to be physically active than boys at this age. Researchers are calling for strategies designed to prevent childhood obesity to do more to tackle this issue. Writing in the journal, they say: "While our screens have become flatter, our children have become fatter." Prof Nick Finer, consultant endocrinologist and bariatric physician at University College London, said the study was "powerful" although it couldn't prove that a bedroom TV directly caused weight gain. But he added: "It is hard not to think that parents concerned about their child's risk of becoming overweight might appropriately consider not putting a TV in their young children's bedrooms." Poor eating habits Prof Russell Viner, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) said the findings should be taken seriously. "With a third of 11-year-old children in England overweight and almost one in five obese, urgently tackling the childhood obesity epidemic is absolutely vital. "We know that high levels of screen time expose children to increased risks of being overweight on a number of fronts, creating a damaging combination of a more sedentary lifestyle, increased exposure to junk food advertising, disruption to sleep and poorer ability to regulate eating habits when watching TV." Prof Viner said the study supported their call for a ban on junk food advertising on TV before the 21:00 watershed.
The long-range H-6K bomber was among those which took part in drills on islands and reefs to improve China's ability to "reach all territory". The sea, a key trade route, is subject to overlapping claims by six countries. China has been accused of militarising the sea to support its vast claims. The latest move could provoke new tension in the region. Beijing's defence ministry did not specify where the bombers landed but said the training involved simulated strikes against sea targets. An H-6K pilot, Ge Daqing, was quoted in a statement as saying that the training "sharpens our courage and enhances our capabilities in a real war". Experts from the Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) said a video from the Chinese Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper showed an H-6K landing and taking off from a base on Woody Island, the largest of the Paracel Islands. Woody Island, which China calls Yongxing, is also claimed by Vietnam and Taiwan. Although China has deployed fighter jets to Woody Island in the past, this is the first time bombers have landed on a South China Sea island, the AMTI said. It added that an H-6K could reach all of South East Asia from the island. Analysts say bombers will likely soon land in the Spratly Islands further south, where runways and hangars have been built on reefs. From there H-6Ks could reach northern Australia or US bases on Guam, says the AMTI. The US has sailed warships close to artificial islands built by Beijing in the South China Sea to challenge what it sees as Chinese efforts to restrict freedom of navigation in a strategically important area. A Pentagon spokesman told Reuters news agency that the US "remains committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific". "We have seen these same reports and China's continued militarisation of disputed features in the South China Sea only serves to raise tensions and destabilise the region," Lt Col Christopher Logan said. The South China Sea dispute
His body was discovered at 06:30 local time (10:30 GMT) on Saturday at a facility in New York. Officials said his death was an apparent suicide. The FBI is investigating the incident. Epstein, 66, pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy charges last month and was being held without bail. "[He] was found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit from an apparent suicide," a statement from the justice department said. "Mr Epstein was transported... to a local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries, and subsequently pronounced dead," the statement added. Last month, shortly after he was denied bail, Epstein was found semi-conscious in his cell with injuries to his neck. He was treated at a nearby hospital, reports said, before being returned to the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. The facility is considered to be one of the most secure in the country. There are conflicting reports as to whether Epstein was placed on suicide watch following that incident, which prison officials have been investigating as a possible suicide attempt. But US media report that, despite the apparent warning signs, the financier was not on suicide watch at the time of his death. Attorney General William Barr said there were "serious questions that must be answered". He added that he was "appalled" by the news and said the justice department had opened its own investigation. Epstein's death comes a day after hundreds of pages of court documents were released that revealed new allegations against him and some of his associates. What was he charged with? Epstein was accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. He was arrested on 6 July after landing in New Jersey on his private jet. He avoided similar charges in a controversial secret plea deal in 2008, and instead pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. That plea deal was closely scrutinised in recent weeks and, last month, US Labor Secretary Alex Acosta resigned over his role in it. Prosecutors also accused Epstein of paying large amounts of money to two potential witnesses ahead of his trial, which was scheduled to take place next year. He faced up to 45 years in prison if convicted. What reaction has there been? Politicians and other senior officials have reacted with shock, asking how Epstein's death was allowed to happen given his high-profile status and the apparent suicide attempt in July. Michael Bromwich, a former inspector general at the justice department, called for an "immediate and comprehensive... investigation to determine who is responsible". One union leader for federal prison workers, Joe Rojas, told NBC News that Epstein "should have been on suicide watch". "You don't have to be a psychologist. It's common sense," he told the network on Saturday. Elsewhere, Epstein's alleged victims have expressed disappointment that he will no longer stand trial. "I am extremely mad and hurt thinking he once again thought he was above us and took the easy way out," Jena-Lisa Jones said in a statement. "I am angry Jeffrey Epstein won't have to face the survivors of his abuse in court," another alleged victim, Jennifer Araoz, told CNBC. "We have to live with the scars of his actions for the rest of our lives." A lawyer for some of the alleged victims, Lisa Bloom, said she would still seek compensation for them. "We would have preferred he lived to face justice. Our civil cases can still proceed against his estate. Victims deserve to be made whole for the lifelong damage he caused," she wrote on Twitter. "I've sat with my clients as they have cried and talked about how their lives were changed forever," she told MSNBC. "They deserve compensation." US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, said the news of Epstein's death was "disturbing". "We are deeply aware of their potential to present yet another hurdle to giving Epstein's many victims their day in court," he said in a statement. "We remain committed to standing for you, and our investigation... remains ongoing." Who was Jeffrey Epstein? New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections. He was often seen socialising with the rich and powerful, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and the UK's Prince Andrew. In a 2002 profile in New York Magazine, Mr Trump referred to Epstein as a "terrific guy". But he later said the pair fell out "12 or 15 years ago" and reiterated last month that he was "not a fan of Jeffrey Epstein". Reports of Epstein's wealth vary, with his Virgin Islands-based firm generating no public records. History of the allegations 2002: The earliest allegations of abuse covered by the recent case take place. October 2002: Donald Trump tells New York magazine he has known Epstein for 15 years, and that he is a "terrific guy.... it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side". 2005: One of Epstein's alleged victims, aged 14, reports him to the police in Palm Beach - sparking the first investigation. May 2006: Epstein is charged with unlawful sex acts with a minor. Later in the year, the case is referred to the FBI. 2007: A plea deal is struck with Alex Acosta, the US attorney in Florida. Instead of facing federal sex-trafficking charges, he pleads guilty to two charges of soliciting prostitution, including with a minor. June 2008: Epstein is sentenced to 13 months in prison - a private wing of a county jail. He is also allowed to leave for work - up to 12 hours a day, six days a week. He does, however, have to register as a sex offender. April 2017: Alex Acosta is appointed labor secretary by now-President Donald Trump. November 2018: The Miami Herald publishes its explosive investigation into Epstein, the plea deal, and the dozens of women alleging abuse. July 2019: Epstein is arrested on new sex-trafficking charges, which he denied. Alex Acosta resigns.
Heard, 30, filed for divorce in Los Angeles Superior Court citing irreconcilable differences. They married 15 months ago and have no children. They have recently been embroiled in a legal case in Australia after Heard took two dogs into the country illegally. She pleaded guilty in April to a charge of falsifying documents. Depp, 52, and Heard met while co-starring in the 2011 film The Rum Diary. In the court papers, Texan-born Heard listed the separation date as Sunday. Celebrity news website TMZ reported that Depp had asked a judge to reject Heard's claim for spousal support. The split comes days after the death of Depp's mother. His latest film, Alice Through the Looking Glass, is due to be released on Friday. The Australian court case started last year when Heard brought two dogs into the country where her husband was filming the latest movie in the Pirates of the Caribbean series. When the case was settled, the couple released a video apology expressing remorse and advising travellers to respect Australian quarantine laws. However, Australia's Deputy PM Barnaby Joyce had threatened to have the dogs put down, triggering a war of words with Depp that lasted for months. The actor recently said on a US TV show that Mr Joyce looks "somehow inbred with a tomato". Mr Joyce responded by saying he was "pulling strings" in Johnny Depp's head, like film villain Hannibal Lecter.
The erotic novelist beat competition from Kate Mosse, JoJo Moyes, Victoria Hislop, Bernard Cornwell and Dorothy Koomson to win the accolade. This year's Booker Prize winner, Hilary Mantel, was chosen as the UK author of the year for a second time. The outstanding achievement award went to crime writer Ian Rankin. Comedian Miranda Hart landed the non-fiction prize for Is It Just Me, while broadcaster Claire Balding took home the biography of the year award, seeing off competition from Salman Rushdie and David Mitchell. Hairy Bikers Si King and Dave Myers beat celebrity chefs Mary Berry, Lorraine Pascale and Hugh Fearney-Whittingstall to take the food and drink book of the year for The Hairy Dieters. David Walliams, who was beaten in the children's book of the year category in 2011, had success at last night's ceremony, hosted by Daybreak's Lorraine Kelly. The comedian-turned-author took the top prize over Simon Mayo, Liz Pichon and Catheryn Constable, for his book Ratburger. US author Eowyn Ivey was named international author of the year for her book, The Snow Child, about an Alaskan couple who sculpt a child out of snow. While new writer of the year award went to the Booker-nominated Rachel Joyce, for The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry. Each of the winners will now go forward to compete for the best overall book of the year, voted for by the public, which will be announced on 26 December.
By Judith BurnsBBC News education reporter Researchers for Which? University have uncovered dozens of daft groups across UK campuses. Despite higher fees and precarious job prospects, student clubs seem keen to show it is still possible to have fun. Nerdfighters, for example, is for those "not composed of cells and tissue, but instead made entirely of awesome". Drinking is key to these groups, as is eating - but dressing up in a pantomime costume and running around the city centre also seems important. 'Nerd positive' There are groups to suit the strangest tastes from Competitive Eating, wearing your onesie in public in the KiguSoc or brewing mead dressed as a Viking. Essex University's Mario Kart Society "is based on the Mario Kart Double Dash game. There's a Double Dash league and knockout tournaments", as well as social events and volunteering, says their website. These include "a huge amount of dress up and a variety of different themes, such as a Mario v Luigi themed night." If you want to run through Colchester dressed as a rabbit - this may be the club for you. Nerdfighters Societies can be found at UK universities including Manchester Metropolitan and University of Bath. "This is a nerd positive society, based mostly on the works of the vlogbrothers, the awesome John and Hank Green", proclaims the MMU Nerdfighters Society website. The idea is to "break down the nerd stereotype and fight for good causes", while attending quiz nights and movie marathons. At Plymouth University, members of the Viking Society take part in traditional Viking games and brew their own mead as well as going for walks in full Viking kit. It aims to appeal to "those who are interested to see the hardships of the average Viking man or woman". University of York's Kigusoc "aims to bring together people who have a genuine enthusiasm for Kigus" or Japanese-style animal themed 'onesies'. "Although typically designed for indoor use, we believe there is no occasion or activity that is not improved by a Kigu. "KiguSoc is for those who aren't afraid to get out there and show their love of fleece to the world", says their webpage. Several universities have an Assassin's Guild where players track down and perform mock assassinations on other members of the society while trying to avoid detection and assassination themselves. "No, we are not a group of homicidal students that go round opening fire on unsuspecting students. Well not exactly...", says Sheffield Assassins website. Not quite as lethal but probably equally energetic are the Twenty Minute Societies run by students at Newcastle, Lincoln and Birmingham. These societies send out weekly messages, with the address of a random location. Members have to get there within 20 minutes. Their Facebook walls include injunctions like: "Get outside the union nowwww xxxxxx" and last term were promising more events "once those pesky exams are over". University of Kent's Competitive Eating Society does what it says on the tin. Members aim to eat competitively, to experience new foods and local cuisines but "also to maintain a healthy approach to competitive eating and encourage a healthy lifestyle". Members pictured on their Facebook page look fairly slender and meet weekly during term-time "to try the tastiest challenges out there." These include the "Metre of Pizza Challenge". 'Gentlemanly pursuits' Somewhat more discriminating is the Bath University Curry Appreciation Society offering "amazing socials with great curry, great company and at a great price". The Keele Society of Gentlemanly Pursuits "indulges in the finer things in life such as fine liquors and music of good quality". If many of these pursuits appear puerile, the ultimate example is The Sheila and her dog Society in Cambridge. At meetings members regress to age six, drink cocoa and read children's stories to each other. Their website declares the group "the silliest society in Cambridge - no matter what PoohSoc says". The Little Prince, a spokesman for the the group, said it is designed to appeal to shyer students - who like to be silly - but in relative privacy. Membership is for life and is not confined to students, the prince told BBC News. Raechel Mattey of the National Union of Students said: "One of the great freedoms about going to college and university is the chance for each student to create and shape activities. "It can be an enormous pressure to be a student today, so it's definitely right that universities and unions can aid in the fun side of life too."
About 1,000 police took part in morning raids on 72 premises across the city. Those held helped run an unofficial "primary" to pick opposition candidates ahead of postponed 2020 elections. They are accused of trying to "overthrow" the government. Activists say the new law aims to quash dissent. China's government imposed the legislation on the semi-autonomous territory in June, saying it was necessary to curb months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. Beijing defended Wednesday's arrests, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying they were needed to stop "external forces and individuals [colluding] to undermine China's stability and security". But the crackdown appeared to confirm the fears of many who warned about the reach of the law, with Amnesty International saying the arrests are "the starkest demonstration yet of how the national security law has been weaponised to punish anyone who dares to challenge the establishment". Who was detained? Dozens have been arrested under the security law since it was enacted in June, but never have so many been rounded up at the same time as on Wednesday, which marked a major escalation in the crackdown and sent a chill through pro-democracy figures. Police fanned out around the city and in early morning raids detained 53 people who represent a who's who of democratic forces in the former British colony, young and old. They include: Police also searched the home of already detained activist Joshua Wong, as well as three news outlets. Apple Daily and Stand News, which had co-organised election forums for the primaries candidates, and In-Media, which ran ads around the primaries, were ordered to hand over information. Mr Clancy, a veteran legal activist and long-time resident of Hong Kong, is chairman of the Asian Human Rights Commission and the first US citizen held under the new law. He was detained when police searched the offices of law firm Ho Tse Wai & Partners where he works. Hours after the dawn arrests John Lee, Hong Kong's security secretary, confirmed a group of people had been arrested as part of an operation targeting those suspected of "overthrowing" the city's government. The government will not tolerate "subversive" acts, he said, speaking at the city's Legislative Council. If charged under the new national security law, the detainees could face life in prison. The BBC's Danny Vincent in Hong Kong says the legislation has spread what activists call "white terror" across the city. It has all but silenced the street protest movement and led to a growing number of activists fleeing the territory. When authorities introduced the law, they claimed it would target only a small number of activists, but the wide-ranging nature of Wednesday's operation has led many to fear the authorities are now trying to eliminate the entire opposition camp, he says. What were the primaries? In July last year, an alliance of opposition parties ran independently organised primaries to see which of their candidates had the best chances in September's election for the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's parliament. More than 600,000 people voted in the primaries. The election was later postponed, with officials citing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the delay. The opposition groups had hoped that winning more seats would give them enough power to block government proposals and increase pressure for democratic reforms. Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam had warned at the time the primaries could amount to subversion if the candidates intended to obstruct government policies through their election. Several of the opposition figures planning to stand in the LegCo election were later disqualified from running, including Joshua Wong, Lester Shum and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist who rose to prominence covering the 2019 protests. Most of the opposition lawmakers in the current LegCo resigned in November in protest at four of them being dismissed from parliament. What's been the reaction? The crackdown has stunned people in Hong Kong. "Seeing the news today I feel completely shocked. I feel very disappointed. It seems that such major things are happening in Hong Kong and there's nothing we can do about it. "I feel very unhappy and it seems that even during the epidemic the government can still do so many things to terrorise people," Mannie Ng, a Hong Kong resident, told Reuters news agency. The arrests have been widely condemned internationally. Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's pick as next US Secretary of State, said they were an "assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights". "The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy." UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the arrests were a "grievous attack" on rights applied under the joint declaration signed with Britain when the territory was handed over in 1997. He said it demonstrated the national security law was "being used to crush dissent and opposing political views". Chris Patten, the territory's last British governor, said: "The Chinese Communist Party has further turned the screw in Hong Kong. Liberal democracies around the world must continue to speak out against the brutal destruction of a free society." Maya Wang, China specialist at Human Rights Watch, said China was now "removing the remaining veneer of democracy in the city". "Beijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government," she said. Nathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong activist who fled the territory in July last year, said the widespread arrests had taken "the suppression of political freedom and freedom of speech" to "another level". "Anyone who is still defending the National Security Law and making peace is the enemy of Hong Kong people." Street protests a 'distant memory' By Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai Beijing sees "vicious plans" to topple Hong Kong's semi-autonomous government. Supporters of the dozens arrested see another crude crackdown on what's left of the territory's nascent democracy. Despite co-ordinated international criticism, with some targeted retaliation, led by the US and the UK, the authorities have enthusiastically embraced their powers under the new national security law passed last year. How these latest arrests come under that jurisdiction is not yet clear. But it's worth remembering this law is ambiguous and sweeping in its definition, targeting anyone, anywhere in the world. The street protests are now a distant memory. Some prominent figures have fled to friendly countries, almost certainly never to return. What is Hong Kong's security law? The security law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail. It has been widely criticised by rights groups and Western nations as effectively curtailing dissent. A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. It retained more civil and political freedoms than the mainland has. Activists say that in recent years, these freedoms have been eroded. Pro-democracy protests have often led to violent clashes with police. The Chinese government has defended the law, saying it will help return stability to the territory, which has been shaken by pro-democracy protests, and bring it more into line with the Chinese mainland. After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety and several high profile court cases under the security law have started. Media tycoon Jimmy Lai has been charged under it as well as several activists who tried to flee the territory by boat last August.
Pairi Daiza zoo announced the arrival of the "extremely rare" cubs, a male and a female, on Friday. The next few days for the cubs will be crucial, Pairi Daiza said. The animals and the mother, Hao Hao, will be monitored by staff to ensure that she cares for the cubs properly. Eric Domb, president and founder of Pairi Daiza, said in a statement: "The double birth is wonderful news for this extraordinary species that is still threatened today. "We're very proud." The cubs were born on Thursday. The male cub weighed 160 grams, while the female arrived two hours later weighing 150 grams. In order to give Hao Hao a rest, zookeepers will put one of the cubs at a time in an incubator and feed it with a bottle. Hao Hao was inseminated in April. The twins are the second and third cubs that she has given birth to at Pairi Daiza. She is currently on a 15-year loan from China.

The new case is a known contact of a previous British patient, and caught the virus in France. It comes after around 200 British and foreign nationals evacuated from Wuhan on the UK's final rescue flight arrived at RAF Brize Norton on Sunday. There have been more than 37,000 cases of the virus globally, mostly in China, where it originated. The death toll for coronavirus has now overtaken that of the Sars epidemic in 2003, according to health officials in China, reaching 813. In 2003, 774 people were killed by Sars. In a statement on Sunday, Professor Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said the latest UK patient has been transferred to a specialist NHS centre at the Royal Free hospital in north London. "We are now using robust infection control measures to prevent any possible further spread of the virus," he said. "The NHS is extremely well prepared to manage these cases and treat them, and we are working quickly to identify any further contacts the patient has had. "This patient followed NHS advice by self-isolating rather than going to A&E." Meanwhile, a British man has been diagnosed with coronavirus in Majorca after contact with a carrier in France. The repatriation flight arrived at RAF Brize Norton at around 07:30 GMT on Sunday, carrying more than 200 British and foreign nationals. The Foreign Office said the flight was the second and last flight chartered by the government out of Wuhan, the city where the new coronavirus emerged. The passengers comprised 105 Britons and their family members as well as 95 Europeans. A total of 13 staff and medics were also on board the flight. Evacuees were taken on eight coaches to a Milton Keynes conference centre and hotel for 14 days of quarantine. NHS staff in blue scrubs, gloves and masks met passengers as they disembarked from the coaches at around 10:30 GMT. The UK's ambassador to Beijing, Dame Barbara Woodward, told the BBC that two British people who wanted to join the flight were not allowed to board after failing temperature checks in China. Elsewhere, the government in the Balearic Islands confirmed on Sunday a British man has tested positive for coronavirus. He was admitted to hospital in Palma on Friday, along with his wife and two daughters. The rest of his family have tested negative for the virus. The local health ministry said an investigation into cases that may have had contact with the man has begun. More than 100 UK nationals and family members have already been evacuated to Britain on flights chartered by the UK and other countries. They are being held in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral. The latest returnees will be housed at Kents Hill Park conference centre and hotel, where they will remain in isolation for two weeks - the incubation period of the virus - to ensure they are not infected. At the hotel, they will have access to Netflix, magazines, books, baby equipment including highchairs, children's toys and games, mobile phones, and tablets for reading, games, and browsing the internet, the NHS said. Clothing and toiletries have been laid out for their arrival. Passengers on the previous flight said they were only allowed to travel with a 15kg (33lb) cabin bag. The flight follows the decision by the Foreign Office on 4 February to advise all Britons to leave China if they can. British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have suspended all flights to and from mainland China, while other carriers continue to operate flights between the UK and China. China's National Health Commission said total cases in the country from the virus had reached 37,198 on Sunday morning. Outside of China, 288 cases have been confirmed in 24 countries, according to the World Health Organization. All the fatal cases have been in China and Hong Kong apart from one in the Philippines. In the UK, the Department of Health and Social Care said that 686 people in the UK have been tested for coronavirus as of Saturday afternoon. The virus causes severe short-term infection of the airways, and symptoms usually start with a fever, followed by a dry cough. Most people are likely to fully recover - just as they would from the flu. Two of the UK coronavirus cases - both Chinese nationals - are being treated at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. After the third case was confirmed, it emerged that the British man had been exposed to the virus in Singapore and stopped at a ski resort in France before returning home. There, five more Britons - four adults and a nine-year-old boy - staying at the same chalet in the Alps tested positive for the virus. A student at Portslade Aldridge Community Academy in Brighton is self-isolating for 14 days following advice from Public Health England. Were you evacuated?

The civil rights inquiry seeks to identify employees who have been subject to harassment. "If sexual harassment or discrimination is pervasive...we want to know," the attorney general's office said. Company documents will be seized as part of the investigation. The Weinstein Company, which is based in New York, has come under intense pressure over the scandal and fired Mr Weinstein from its board earlier this month. More than two dozen women - among them actresses Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Rose McGowan - have made a number of accusations against Mr Weinstein. In a statement, New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman said: "No New Yorker should be forced to walk into a workplace ruled by sexual intimidation, harassment, or fear." "If sexual harassment or discrimination is pervasive at a company, we want to know." A source familiar with the investigation told the BBC that prosecutors would subpoena documents as part of the inquiry. These include documents relating to complaints about sexual harassment and how such complaints were handled. Harvey Weinstein, whose films have received more than 300 Oscar nominations, has "unequivocally denied" any allegations of non-consensual sex. Elsewhere, Los Angeles police announced its first investigation involving Mr Weinstein in California. "The Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery Homicide Division has interviewed a potential sexual assault victim involving Harvey Weinstein which allegedly occurred in 2013," LAPD spokesman Sal Ramirez told the BBC. In London, police say Mr Weinstein is accused of assaulting three women in separate incidents in the late 1980s, 1992, 2010, 2011 and 2015. Officers are looking into claims they were attacked in Westminster, Camden and west London. No arrests have been made over any of the allegations, police say. 'Beyond infuriating' Meanwhile, the actor Matt Damon said he became aware of Harvey Weinstein's alleged harassment of Gwyneth Paltrow in 1999. Speaking to ABC News, he said: "I knew the story about Gwyneth [Paltrow] from Ben [Affleck], because he was with her after Brad [Pitt], so I knew that story." In the same interview George Clooney, whose big-screen break was a Weinstein film, said it is "beyond infuriating" that "predator" Harvey Weinstein was "out silencing women". On Monday, at a film premiere in Los Angeles, he spoke about the need to believe women who speak out about sexual assault. "Maybe this is the watershed moment, where we believe women, where they feel safe that they can talk about what they're experiencing", he said. George Clooney and Matt Damon join the list of Hollywood stars who have spoken out to condemn Harvey Weinstein. Last week, the actor Tom Hanks told the BBC that he sees no way back for the film producer. "His last name will become a noun and a verb. It will become an identifying moniker for a state of being for which there was a before and an after", he said.

Yang Hengjun, a blogger and former Chinese diplomat, has not been heard from since flying from New York to Guangzhou on Saturday, a friend said. Sydney academic Feng Chongyi said he feared that Mr Yang had been detained by Chinese authorities. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman said she was "not aware" of the case. Mr Yang is believed to have been travelling with his wife, Chinese national Yuan Rui Juan, and young stepson. A social media post by Ms Yuan appeared to show that she was in Beijing, Australian media reported. It is believed that she was interviewed there by Chinese officials after first travelling to Shanghai to leave her son with relatives, the BBC's Stephen McDonell in Beijing reports. 'We've been trying to contact him' Mr Yang, an Australian citizen who now lives in the US, has a sizeable following online and has been critical of China's Communist Party. He was briefly unreachable on a trip to China in 2011 - prompting fears he was missing - but later attributed the episode to a "misunderstanding". Associate Prof Feng, an academic at University of Technology Sydney, said he had warned Mr Yang recently against travelling to China, but that Mr Yang had replied that he considered himself to be safe. "His friends, family, myself - we have been trying to contact him and her these past four days and we all [failed]," Associate Prof Feng told the BBC. LISTEN: China accused of 'hostage diplomacy' Another friend, Australian journalist John Garnaut, told the Sydney Morning Herald: "Let's hope he reappears today and we can all agree there's just been a misunderstanding." In response to a query about Mr Yang, Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was "seeking information about an Australian citizen who has been reported missing in China". Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said she was not aware of the case but would ask relevant departments for information. Correspondents say this follows a similar pattern to the cases of two Canadian citizens, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were detained in China in recent weeks. In both cases, the foreign ministry initially said it had no knowledge of them being held, then confirmed they were in the hands of state security a few days later. Australia has previously expressed "concern" about the arrests of the Canadians. China has denied the detention of the two men is tied to Canada's arrest of a senior Huawei official, Meng Wanzhou, but many analysts believe it is a tit-for-tat action.
By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent Researchers in New York told the BBC their early results showed carbon monoxide mainly from cars had been reduced by nearly 50% compared with last year. Emissions of the planet-heating gas CO2 have also fallen sharply. But there are warnings levels could rise rapidly after the pandemic. With global economic activity ramping down as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, it is hardly surprising that emissions of a variety of gases related to energy and transport would be reduced. Scientists say that by May, when CO2 emissions are at their peak thanks to the decomposition of leaves, the levels recorded might be the lowest since the financial crisis over a decade ago. While it is early days, data collected in New York this week suggests that instructions to curb unnecessary travel are having a significant impact. Traffic levels in the city were estimated to be down 35% compared with a year ago. Emissions of carbon monoxide, mainly due to cars and trucks, have fallen by around 50% for a couple of days this week according to researchers at Columbia University. They have also found that there was a 5-10% drop in CO2 over New York and a solid drop in methane as well. "New York has had exceptionally high carbon monoxide numbers for the last year and a half," said Prof Róisín Commane, from Columbia University, who carried out the New York air monitoring work. "And this is the cleanest I have ever seen it. It's is less than half of what we normally see in March." Although there are a number of caveats to these findings, they echo the environmental impacts connected to the virus outbreaks in China and in Italy. An analysis carried out for the climate website Carbon Brief suggested there had been a 25% drop in energy use and emissions in China over a two week period. This is likely to lead to an overall fall of about 1% in China's carbon emissions this year, experts believe. Both China and Northern Italy have also recorded significant falls in nitrogen dioxide, which is related to reduced car journeys and industrial activity. The gas is a serious air pollutant and also indirectly contributes to the warming of the planet. With aviation grinding to a halt and millions of people working from home, a range of emissions across many countries are likely following the same downward path. While people working from home will likely increase the use of home heating and electricity, the curbing of commuting and the general slowdown in economies will likely have an impact on overall emissions. "I expect we will have the smallest increase in May to May peak CO2 that we've had in the northern hemisphere since 2009, or even before," said Prof Commane. This view is echoed by others in the field, who believe that the shutdown will impact CO2 levels for the whole of this year. "It will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, and how widespread the slowdown is in the economy particularly in the US. But most likely I think we will see something in the global emissions this year," said Prof Corinne Le Quéré from the University of East Anglia. "If it lasts another three of four months, certainly we could see some reduction." What's likely to make a major difference to the scale of carbon emissions and air pollution is how governments decide to re-stimulate their economies once the pandemic eases. Back in the 2008-09, after the global financial crash, carbon emissions shot up by 5% as a result of stimulus spending that boosted fossil fuel use. In the coming months, governments will have a chance to alter that outcome. They could insist, for instance, that any bailout of airlines would be tied to far more stringent reductions in aviation emissions. "Governments now have to be really cautious on how they re-stimulate their economies, mindful of not locking in fossil fuels again," said Prof Le Quéré. "They should focus those things that are ready to go that would lower emissions, like renovating buildings, putting in heat pumps and electric chargers. These are not complicated and can be done straight away, they are just waiting for financial incentives." However, some argue that if the pandemic goes on a long time, any stimulus would more likely focus on promoting any economic growth regardless of the impact on the environment. "I certainly think climate could go on the back burner, and in this case, I don't think there is much hope that stimulus goes to clean energy," said Prof Glen Peters from the Centre for International Climate Research. "Any stimulus will help those with job losses such as tourism and services. I think this is very different to the global financial crisis. The only silver linings could be to learning new practices to work remotely, and buying a few years of lower growth allowing solar and wind to catch up a bit, though, these may be rather small silver linings."

The ceramic cups feature a faint image of a Nazi-era postage stamp with Hitler's profile on it, postmarked with a swastika stamp. The mug also features a rose and handwriting in English. The Zurbrueggen furniture chain apologised for the "terrible" mistake, which it blamed on "a stupid chain of unfortunate circumstances". The cups' Chinese designer had mistakenly chosen the image of the former dictator, it said, which the chain then ordered in error - 5,000 of them. "No one noticed the problem during unpacking," the company's owner told the Neue Westfaelische Zeitung daily newspaper. The small chain sold 175 of the mugs before anyone drew attention to the black and white profile of the world's most infamous Nazi. Those customers could make a profit on their purchase, though. The company promised to compensate them with a 20-euro (£16.5; $28) gift voucher - a significant mark-up on the original 1.99 euro price. The company may not be the only one keen to get hold of the notorious mugs. The Neue Westfaelische Zeitung also reports that a contemporary history museum in Bonn, the House of History, has also expressed "great interest" in getting hold of some. The chain has destroyed the unsold cups.
Olga Karlova told the BBC he thought doing so would be "pointless" and would rather focus his hope on a possible but unconfirmed prisoner swap with the US. Whelan, 50, was arrested in Moscow in 2018 with a USB drive which security officers say contained state secrets. He insists he was set up. On 15 June, a Moscow City Court found him guilty of receiving classified information. His legal team said at the time that he would appeal - a process that typically takes one to three months. However on Tuesday, Ms Karlova said she and her colleague had visited Whelan at Lefortovo prison earlier in the day, and he signed a paper saying he did not want to appeal when his sentence comes into effect on 26 June. "He decided not to waste time, he doesn't think it will achieve anything. It's pointless," Ms Karlova said. "He said that he'd been thinking about it and, as there are some talks about his return home, he doesn't want to lose a minute." She was referring to recent reports that US and Russian officials may negotiate a prisoner exchange, which would bring about Whelan's release. Russia has previously discounted the prospect of a swap with high-profile Russians in US custody, insisting that Whelan is not a "political prisoner". Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier this month: "No, it is not possible. He was sentenced by a court decision, and the court decision says it all." Whelan called the trial a "sham", saying that without an interpreter, he could not even understand the proceedings. The US said it was "outraged" by the sentence and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for his release. "We have information from various places [that such talks are happening] but I can't tell you where from," lawyer Olga Karlova said, referring to the rumoured prisoner swap. "The information is reliable." The US ambassador has previously told the BBC that "we do not trade our citizens" and called for "justice" for Whelan. But Russian officials have been dropping heavy hints recently about possible candidates for exchange, mentioning two high-profile Russians being held in US prisons. Olga Karlova, who is a state-appointed lawyer and is possibly seeking to accelerate that process, said that "a lot depends on how quickly the US embassy acts". She added that Whelan had asked her to let the diplomats know they should be "as active as possible, because he wants to get home as soon as possible". Whelan is currently being held at the jail in Lefortovo, run by the Federal Security Service (FSB), although once his sentence comes into force he should be transferred to a high-security prison. This may be delayed if negotiations really are under way. Who is Paul Whelan? Paul Whelan is a citizen of four countries - the US, Canada, the UK and the Irish Republic. From Novi, Michigan, he was born in Canada to British parents and moved to the US as a child. Military records show he joined the US Marine Reserves in 1994, about six years after he had reportedly begun work as a police officer in Michigan. He served two tours in Iraq, in 2004 and then 2006, before becoming a security executive. It was while serving in the marines that he made his first trip to Russia, and went on to visit the country many times. Paul Whelan was arrested in his hotel room in central Moscow in December 2018. He says he was getting ready for a wedding when an old friend turned up unexpectedly and gave him a flash drive containing what Whelan's lawyer says his client thought were holiday photographs. Moments later, security officers burst in and arrested him for receiving state secrets.
The drills, called Balikatan (Shoulder to Shoulder), take place every year. These exercises come a week after a military pact to increase the US troop presence in the country was signed. Visiting Manila last week, US President Barack Obama pledged "ironclad" backing for the Philippines, which is engaged in a maritime dispute with China. The two countries have competing claims over a number of islands and shoals in the South China Sea, such as Second Thomas Shoal and Scarborough Shoal. The South East Asian nation has asked a United Nations arbitration tribunal to rule on the issue. At Balikatan's opening ceremony, Filipino Foreign Secretary Albert del Rosario said it was necessary to deal with "aggressive" neighbours intent on "changing the status quo", without mentioning China. He said the 10-day drills would focus on maritime capabilities. They would also include live-fire and maritime surveillance exercises, the Philippine military said. Its public affairs office chief, Ramon Zagala, however, sought to play down Balikatan's significance, saying it was "not related to any current situation". Instead, it was aimed at improving "tactical-level military proficiency" and enhancing US-Filipino co-operation, he said. The military exercise would also focus on humanitarian assistance and disaster response. Military personnel from both countries will offer free medical, dental and veterinary care in Legazpi City, and build and repair infrastructure such as schools in Bicol. As tensions with China have grown, the US and the Philippines have moved to increase co-operation. Last week, Washington and Manila signed a deal allowing US troops better access to military bases, ports and airfields. This exercise comes amid reports China has sent more ships to an area disputed with the Philippines. Over the weekend, Philippine media reported the sighting of more Chinese vessels near Second Thomas Shoal, as the Philippine military air-dropped provisions to its troops stationed on a rusting vessel beached there. Vietnam clashes with China over oil rig Meanwhile, Vietnam has protested against a plan by China to move its first deep-water drilling rig into an area which Vietnam claims as its territory. China's maritime safety authority announced on Saturday that the oil rig Haiyang Shiyou 981 would be drilling in an area located 120 nautical miles off the coast of Vietnam until 15 August. It prohibited ships from entering within one mile of the rig. On Sunday, Vietnam's foreign ministry spokesman Le Hai Binh insisted that this area belonged to them. Any activity by foreign countries conducted in Vietnam's waters without its permission would be considered "illegal and worthless" and would be "resolutely opposed" by Vietnam's government, he said. State oil and gas group PetroVietnam also sent a letter of objection to China's state-run oil company CNOOC, demanding they immediately pull out the rig. In response, China on Monday expanded the prohibited area to three miles.
By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent US universities are still the most dominant international force in the Times Higher Education rankings. In top place, as last year, is the California Institute of Technology. In the UK there are concerns that, outside Oxford, Cambridge and London colleges, many major universities are slipping down international rankings. The so-called "golden triangle" of UK universities - Oxford, Cambridge and leading London institutions - is seen as a breakaway elite group, with these universities consolidating their international reputations. Imperial College, University College London, LSE and King's College London are all in the top 40. London has more universities in this league table than all of Japan, although only Imperial College makes the top 10. Clusters of excellence Phil Baty, editor of the rankings, says this is part of a global pattern of clustering of "excellent universities". Boston in the US has eight universities in the top 200, more than entire countries such as China, Switzerland and Australia. But there are warnings from the rankings organisation that prominent UK regional universities are falling away. Edinburgh, Manchester, Bristol, Sheffield, Warwick, Southampton, Nottingham and Newcastle are all seen as going downwards against international rivals. However the University of Leicester has risen sharply, which has been described as the "Richard III effect", after the high-profile research associated with the discovery of the body of the medieval king. This is described by the Times Higher Education rankings as showing that "power is draining from the UK regions". The top 20 still reflects the dominance of wealthy US university powerhouses, taking 15 of the top 20 places, with institutions such Harvard, MIT and Stanford in the leading pack behind the California Institute of Technology. The highest UK university is Oxford and the highest ranked continental European university is ETH Zurich in Switzerland, which is also the only non-English speaking university in the top 20. "No university can rest on its laurels. No-one is guaranteed to retain a top-200 place when the US, Far East and others are investing in research so heavily," said Sir David Bell, vice-chancellor of Reading University, which has fallen from 176th to 194th place. "There are some dramatic year-on-year rises and falls this year, so we should be careful not to read too much into a single set of figures." "It is no surprise that a small number of UK universities at the very top end will remain more stable, with others more likely to fluctuate." Sir Christopher Snowden, president of Universities UK, said the rankings showed that the UK had "the second-strongest university system in the world after the US". "What is clear, however, is that the UK must continue to invest in higher education if we are to maintain this global competitiveness."
In Shanghai there is an entire museum containing 70,000 artefacts dedicated to one man, "the people's scientist" Qian Xuesen. Qian is the father of China's missile and space programme. His research helped develop the rockets that fired China's first satellite into space, and missiles that became part of its nuclear arsenal, and he is revered as a national hero. But in another superpower, where he studied and worked for more than a decade, his significant contributions are rarely remembered at all. Qian was born in 1911, as China's last imperial dynasty was about to be replaced by a republic. His parents were both well-educated and his father, after working in Japan, established China's national education system. It was evident from an early age that Qian was gifted, and he eventually graduated top of his class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, winning a rare scholarship to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. In 1935 a trim, well-dressed young man arrived in Boston. Qian may have experienced some xenophobia and racism, says Chris Jespersen, professor of history at the University of North Georgia. But there was "also a sentiment of hope and belief that China [was] changing in fundamentally significant ways", and he would certainly have been among people who respected his knowledge. From MIT Qian moved to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), to study under one of the most influential aeronautical engineers of the day, the Hungarian émigré, Theodore von Karman. There Qian shared an office with another prominent scientist, Frank Malina, who was a key member of a small group of innovators known as the Suicide Squad. The group had earned this nickname because of their attempts to build a rocket on campus, and because some of their experiments with volatile chemicals went badly wrong, says Fraser Macdonald, author of Escape from Earth: A Secret History of the Space Rocket. Though he adds that no-one died. One day Qian got drawn into a discussion of a complicated mathematical problem with Malina and other members of the group and before long he was an integral part of it, producing seminal research into rocket propulsion. At the time, rocket science was the "stuff of cranks and fantasists," Macdonald says. "No-one is taking it seriously - no mathematically inclined engineer would risk their reputation by saying this is the future." But that quickly changed with the start of World War II. The Suicide Squad caught the attention of the US military, which paid for research into jet-assisted take-off, where boosters were attached to the wings of aircraft to enable them to get airborne from short runways. Military funding also helped establish the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) in 1943, under the directorship of Theodore von Karman. Qian, along with Frank Malina, was at the heart of the project. Qian was a Chinese citizen, but the Republic of China was an ally of the US, so there was "no massive suspicion about a Chinese scientist at the heart of American space endeavour", says Fraser Macdonald. Qian was given security clearance to work on classified weapons research, and even served on the US government's Science Advisory Board. By the end of the war he was one of the world's foremost experts on jet propulsion, and was sent with Theodore von Karman on an extraordinary mission to Germany, holding the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel. Their goal was to interview Nazi engineers, including Wernher von Braun, Germany's leading rocket scientist; America wanted to find out exactly what the Germans knew. But by the end of the decade Qian's glittering career in the US came to a sudden halt, and his life there began to unravel. In China, Chairman Mao declared the creation of the communist People's Republic in 1949, and quickly the Chinese came to be seen in the US as "the evil ones", says Chris Jespersen. "So we go through these periods in the US where we are infatuated with China, then something happens and we revile China," he says. Meanwhile, a new director at the JPL came to believe there was a spy ring at the lab, and shared his suspicions about some members of staff with the FBI. "I note that they are all either Chinese or Jewish," says Fraser Macdonald. The Cold War was under way, and the anti-communist witch-hunts of the McCarthy era were just around the corner. It was in this atmosphere that the FBI accused Qian, Frank Malina and others of being communists, and a threat to national security. The charges against Qian were based on a 1938 document of the US Communist Party that showed he had attended a social gathering that the FBI suspected was a meeting of the Pasadena Communist Party. Although Qian denied being a party member, new research suggests he joined at the same time as Frank Malina in 1938. But this doesn't necessarily make him a Marxist. To be a communist at this time was a statement of anti-racism, says Fraser Macdonald. The group wanted to highlight the threat of fascism, he says, as well as the horror of racism in the US. They were campaigning, for example, against the segregation of the local Pasadena swimming pool, and used their communist meetings to discuss it. Zuoyue Wang, professor of history at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, says there is no evidence that Qian ever spied for China or was an intelligence agent when he was in the US. He was, however, stripped of his security clearance and put under house arrest. Caltech colleagues, including Theodore von Karman, wrote to the government pleading Qian's innocence, but in vain. In 1955, when Qian had spent five years under house arrest, President Eisenhower took the decision to deport him to China. The scientist left by boat with his wife and two US-born children, telling waiting reporters he would never step foot in America again. He kept his promise. "He was one of the most prominent scientists in America. He had contributed so much and could have contributed much more. So it's not just humiliation but also a sense of betrayal," says the journalist and writer, Tianyu Fang. Qian arrived as a hero in China but was not immediately admitted into the Chinese Communist Party. His record was not impeccable. His wife was the aristocratic daughter of a Nationalist leader, and until Qian's fall from grace he'd been living happily in America - he'd even taken the first steps towards applying for citizenship. When he finally became a party member in 1958, he embraced it and always tried to remain on the right side of the regime. He survived purges and the Cultural Revolution, and thus was able to pursue an extraordinary career. When he had arrived in China there was little understanding of rocket science, but 15 years later he oversaw the launch of the first Chinese satellite into space. Over the decades, he trained a new generation of scientists, and his work laid the foundations for China's Lunar Exploration Program. Ironically, the missile programme that Qian helped develop in China resulted in weapons which were then fired back on America. Qian's silkworm missiles were fired at Americans in the 1991 Gulf War, Fraser Macdonald says, and in 2016 against the USS Mason by Huti rebels in Yemen. "So there's this odd circularity. The US expelled this expertise, and it has come back to bite them." In taking a tough line against domestic communism, he suggests, the country deported "the means by which one of their main communist rivals could develop their own missiles and space programme - an extraordinary geopolitical blunder." A former US Secretary of the Navy, Dan Kimball - later head of the rocket propulsion company, Aerojet - once said it was "the stupidest thing this country ever did". Today, there is once again heightened tension between China and the US. This time it's not over ideology but trade, concerns over tech security, and China's failure - as President Donald Trump regards it - to do more to contain Covid-19. While most Americans have no idea about Qian and his role in America's space programme, Tianyu Fang says many Chinese Americans and Chinese students in the US, do know about him, and why he had to leave, and they see the parallels with the present day. "US China relations have got so much worse they know they could be under the same suspicions as Qian's generation," he says. In Fraser Macdonald's view, Qian's story is a warning about what happens when you expel knowledge. "The whole story of American science is that it is propelled by people coming from outside… but in these conservative times that's a story that becomes harder to celebrate." The JPL's contribution to the US space programme has, Macdonald believes, been much neglected compared to that of Wernher von Braun and other German scientists, who were taken in secret to the US soon after the visit paid to them by von Karman and Qian. Braun had been a Nazi, and yet his achievements are recognised in a way that those of Qian and others from the JPL are not, Macdonald says. "The idea that America's first viable space programme was started by homegrown socialists - whether Jewish or Chinese - is not really a story that the US is able to hear about itself," he says. Qian's life spanned almost a century. In that time China grew from an economic minnow to a superpower on Earth and in space. Qian was part of that transformation. But his story could have been a great American one too - where talent, wherever it is found, could thrive. Last year, when China made history and landed on the far side of the moon, it did so in the Von Karman crater, named after the aeronautical engineer who was a mentor to Qian. A nod, perhaps, to the fact that American anti-communism helped propel China into space.

The defence contractor will build the OPVs at its two Glasgow shipyards at Govan and Scotstoun. The £20m deal will enable BAE to begin work on parts such as the engines and gearboxes, which require a longer time to make, ahead of actual ship building. Work on the structure of the OPVs will begin later this year. The deal was announced by Defence Minister Philip Dunne during a visit to the BAE's two shipyards on the River Clyde in Glasgow. 'Significant milestone' "This £20m is a significant milestone, critical to the successful delivery of these three vessels for the Royal Navy," he said. "The OPVs will not only provide an additional capability for the UK but also at its peak, the OPV programme will safeguard more than 800 vital skilled roles in the shipbuilding industry." The new OPVs will be used to support counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti-smuggling operations in UK waters. The first vessel is expected to be delivered to the Royal Navy in 2017.
By Peter Ball BBC World Service Some people are convinced it is, and more than 50 years later, a bitter battle has erupted over both the ownership of the picture and the evidence about who painted it. The so-called "Earlier Mona Lisa" is at the heart of a mystery that involves Caribbean tax havens, Swiss bank vaults, a mysterious international consortium, and the Sherlock Holmes of the art world. So is it genuine? Who are the rightful owners? And could the portrait at the centre of this Da Vinci Code-style mystery be worth hundreds of millions of dollars? A court case in Italy this week may finally help shed some light on the answers to these questions. A second Mona Lisa? In 2012, an organisation called the Mona Lisa Foundation unveiled to the world, in a blaze of publicity, what it claimed to be a second painting of the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. Since the Mona Lisa is possibly the world's most famous painting, and its painter is regarded as one of history's greatest artists, such a find would turn the art world upside down. The foundation set out an array of evidence to try to back up the claim that the painting was a second, previously unknown version of the portrait. But curiously the organisation claims it doesn't own the painting. It says the picture is owned by an unnamed international consortium. When asked about this, the foundation's general secretary, Joël Feldman, replies: "The foundation, as a matter of policy and in compliance with its obligations, does not comment on the ownership consortium." But at their home in south London, Andrew and Karen Gilbert have a different story - they say they own a 25% share in the portrait. When they contacted the Mona Lisa Foundation after it unveiled the portrait in 2012 they claimed the organisation said it "didn't know anything about us, they weren't the owners and just tried to bat us away as someone inconvenient". "Because we were unable to find out who the owner was, nobody was telling us anything, we didn't know how we could launch any kind of proceedings," Karen says. This week has seen a dramatic development that the Gilberts believe may lead to a breakthrough in their claim. But a claim in what? Is it possible for a near priceless Leonard da Vinci portrait to suddenly come to light? The $450m painting Incredibly, that's exactly what happened with a painting called the Salvator Mundi - or Saviour of the World. Sold for just £45 ($55) in 1958, it was bought at auction for an incredible $450m (£357m) by an anonymous buyer two years ago. The difference, of course, was down to the painting being authenticated by an international team of experts as a genuine Leonardo. Could the painting dubbed the Earlier Mona Lisa by the foundation follow the same path? 'Had to be a Leonardo' "I was sceptical but intrigued," Professor Jean-Pierre Isbouts says from Santa Monica, California - he was flown to Switzerland by the foundation to view the painting. "I walked into the vault, it was very cold in there, and I spent about two hours with that painting. But after five minutes I recognised that this had to be a Leonardo." But it wasn't just the appearance that made the academic from Fielding Graduate University in California (whose work is recommended by the foundation) believe the portrait was genuine - it was also the historical evidence, he says. "Giorgio Vasari, the [16th Century] biographer of Leonardo, clearly states that Leonardo worked on the Mona Lisa for four years and then left it unfinished." This matches the appearance of the Earlier Mona Lisa, which has an incomplete background, unlike the famous portrait that hangs in the Louvre. Professor Isbouts also points out that historical records mention Leonardo painting the Mona Lisa for two different clients, raising the possibility that he completed two separate portraits, one for each commission. He adds that scientific tests appear to back up the claim the painting is genuine. "With the Earlier Mona Lisa the science told us a) it is from the early 16th Century, b) it is definitely a composition by Leonardo because the configuration and the composition is identical to that of the Louvre Mona Lisa. And c) the histograms [digital graphs of the colours used] show that in terms of the 'handwriting' of the painting, how he applies the paint, [it] is exactly identical." But not everyone agrees. "A bit of rubbish" "It's not the real article for a whole series of reasons," Martin Kemp, emeritus professor of art history at the University of Oxford, says. "It really isn't a serious runner to be by Leonardo himself." He thinks the reason Giorgio Vasari believed the Mona Lisa to be incomplete was because "Vasari's information was all Florentine", and the picture was probably completed after Leonardo had left the city of Florence. And he disagrees that historical records suggest two Mona Lisas were painted. Instead Professor Kemp says Leonardo probably never handed the portrait over to his original client, and a second person "might well have said if you finish that, I'll take it off you, as it were". And the scientific evidence? Professor Kemp says the information offered by the Mona Lisa Foundation is only "permissive" and, while not ruling out the Earlier Mona Lisa from being by Leonardo, it certainly doesn't prove that it is. However, he adds "examination by infrared and other technical means, shows that it [the Louvre Mona Lisa] underwent an evolution, as all Leonardo's pictures did. "The infrared examination of the Isleworth Madonna [as Earlier Mona Lisa is also known] is just tediously exact and is clearly the kind of drawing that's made when you're copying something rather than generating it." Professor Isbouts, however, is critical of Professor Kemp's analysis in part because "Martin has never seen the work, and that's the beef that David and Joel [Feldman of the Mona Lisa Foundation] have, and I think it's a legitimate beef." In response Professor Kemp replies: "The old canard that you always have to go and see it in the original, even if it is a bit of rubbish, is not sustainable, particularly with modern imaging techniques. And some of the high quality digital images, you can actually see more in them than you can see in the painting, even with a magnifying glass." Shifting evidence The experts may disagree about the evidence, but has all the material been presented clearly? The BBC has seen sections of a pre-production copy of a book - written by several contributors but edited by Professor Isbouts - about the Earlier Mona Lisa, called "Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa: New Perspectives". One of the contributors claims that in the final, published, version of the book, sections of his text seem to have been removed. He claims many of the deleted passages appear to be ones that are not helpful to the theory that the Earlier Mona Lisa is by Leonardo. Professor Isbouts denied this: "I definitely edited some segments because I'm the editor. And in some cases there were passages that I don't think were scholarly defensible. I was just trying to keep the thrust of the argument intact - I certainly didn't remove anything of a contrarian nature. There were two chapters that were simply way too long." He later emailed the BBC, having contacted the contributor to see which passages he was concerned about, and said: "We are working on the final version of the book, in hardcover, so we can still make some corrections within the available word count." A Mona Lisa, but no money One thing supporters of the theory that the Earlier Mona Lisa is by Leonardo da Vinci have to explain is where the painting came from. It suddenly emerged in 1913, when Hugh Blaker bought it from a manor house in Somerset. "Blaker believed he was on to something," says Professor Robert Meyrick of Aberystwyth University who studies the life of the art dealer. Despite successfully tracking down genuine paintings by artists such as Rubens, Velázquez, El Greco, Manet, Constable, and Turner, Blaker's business dealings often went badly, and he never managed to sell his Mona Lisa. "It was like a like a catalogue of failures really, despite his best efforts," says Professor Meyrick, of the man who struggled financially in later life. Following Blaker's death, the painting ended up in the hands of an eccentric art dealer called Henry Pulitzer - he believed the Earlier Mona Lisa was actually more impressive than its more famous counterpart in the Louvre. But Pulitzer needed some help in trying to convince the world that they were both by Leonardo. A helping hand "He started running out of money to promote it, because he wanted to prove that it was a real Leonardo da Vinci," Andrew Gilbert says. His family knew Pulitzer, bought pictures from him, and sold him some too. They have shown the BBC a series of documents which they say shows the family bought a 25% share of the painting in 1964. About a decade later Pulitzer locked the portrait in a Swiss bank vault, and following his death, it eventually ended up in the hands of the international consortium in 2008. The Mona Lisa Foundation vehemently disagrees with the Gilberts' claim, its president telling the press in July their case is "ill-founded and has no merit". But the family have pressed on and called in the "Sherlock Holmes" of the art world to help. "Well, I guess I don't mind it," Christopher Marinello, CEO and founder of Art Recovery International, says about his nickname. "We've recovered about $510m (£400m) worth of art over the years. We're still heavily involved in some of the biggest cases going on right now in the art world, and we're proud of that." But what does he think of the claim that the painting in this case might be by Leonardo da Vinci? "I honestly don't care about any of it," he replies. "As far as I'm concerned, this is a simple matter of clients who have a contract of purchase for this painting, whatever it may be." It's thanks to Mr Marinello that the Gilberts (who say they themselves are not sure if the portrait is a real Leonardo) began legal proceedings against the Mona Lisa Foundation in Italy while the painting was being exhibited in Florence. The Caribbean connection Ahead of this week's court hearing, the Gilberts' lawyer, Giovanni Protti, said this is the "most tricky and interesting case I've ever worked on". "We've had to service a writ of summons to a lot of countries all over the world." And that work has borne fruit. After a court hearing on Tuesday, Karen Gilbert says: "The Mona Lisa Foundation declared in front of the judge that Mona Lisa Inc in Anguilla was the owner of the painting." There is nothing to suggest such an arrangement implies any wrong-doing by the foundation or the international consortium, but the Caribbean island, which is a British Overseas Territory, is known for its discreet way of doing business. "We're chipping away at it," Karen says. "We know therefore that we're on the right track with the research that we've done." This doesn't establish that the Gilbert family do own a share in the portrait, but it is the first time that the Mona Lisa Foundation have disclosed who the owner is. In response to Tuesday's hearing, the Mona Lisa Foundation's lawyer, Marco Parducci, says: "The Mona Lisa Foundation can neither confirm nor deny the claim, by virtue of the legal obligations it has towards the owners, unless it is explicitly requested by the judicial authority." He adds that the Gilberts' claims suggest they are motivated by "economic interest and the desire to damage the foundation" and the next hearing in March will show "that there is no case". Fame The legal battle will roll on, but what would Leonardo, the great renaissance scholar, make of puzzles like the Earlier Mona Lisa and the myths that surround his work, 500 years after his death? "Oh, he would be incredibly pleased," laughs Professor Kemp. "He was interested in fame. "He would have cringed at some of the nonsense, but the fact that his name is the best-known name in the history of culture? Yes, he'd be very pleased."
She has become a leading voice, inspiring millions to join protests around the world. On Friday, she addressed students in Bristol. But who is she and what does she want? Who is Greta Thunberg? She is a 17-year-old who grew up in Stockholm, in Sweden. Greta's mother, Malena Ernman, is an opera singer and former Eurovision Song Contest participant. Her father Svante Thunberg, is an actor, and is a descendant of Svante Arrhenius, a scientist who came up with a model of the greenhouse effect. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1903. The elder of two girls, she says she learned about climate change when she was eight, but that her parents were not climate activists. Greta has Asperger's syndrome, a developmental disorder, and has described it as a gift and said being different is a "superpower". When did she start campaigning? In May 2018, aged 15, Greta won a climate change essay competition in a local newspaper. Three months later, in August, she started protesting in front of the Swedish parliament building, vowing to continue until the Swedish government met the carbon emissions target agreed by world leaders in Paris, in 2015. She held a sign that read "School Strike for Climate" and began regularly missing lessons to go on strike on Fridays, urging students around the world to join her. Her protests went viral on social media and as support for her cause grew, other strikes started around the world, spreading with the hashtag #FridaysForFuture. By December 2018, more than 20,000 students around the world had joined her in countries including Australia, the UK, Belgium, the US and Japan. She joined strikes around Europe, choosing to travel by train to limit her impact on the environment. What has she done since then? The teenager took the whole of 2019 off school to continue campaigning, to attend key climate conferences, and to join student protests around the world. In September 2019, she travelled to New York to address a UN climate conference. Greta refuses to fly because of its environmental impact, so she made her way there on a racing yacht, in a journey that lasted two weeks. When she arrived, millions of people around the world took part in a climate strike, underlining the scale of her influence. Addressing the conference, she blasted politicians for relying on young people for answers to climate change. She said: "How dare you? I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?" She was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year. What does she want? Greta says big governments and businesses around the world are not moving quickly enough to cut carbon emissions and has attacked world leaders for failing young people. Initially, her protests focused on the Swedish government's climate targets, and she urged students around the world to make similar demands in their own countries. But as her fame has grown, she has called for governments around the world to do more to cut global emissions. She has spoken at international meetings, including the UN's 2019 climate change gathering in New York, and this year's World Economic Forum in Davos. At the forum, she called for banks, firms and governments to stop investing and subsidising fossil fuels, such as oil, coal and gas. "Instead, they should invest their money in existing sustainable technologies, research and in restoring nature," she said. What do people say about her? Millions of students around the world have been inspired by her strikes, and Greta has received support from climate activists, scientists, world leaders and the Pope, who told her to "continue" her work. Broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough told her she had achieved things many others have failed to do, adding: "you have aroused the world. I'm very grateful to you." But her message has not been well received by everyone. After her UN appearance in September 2019, US President Donald Trump appeared to mock her by saying she "must work on her anger management problem". Greta then changed her Twitter biography to include Mr Trump's words. She did the same weeks later when Russian President Vladimir Putin called her a "kind but poorly informed teenager". In January, US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told the teenager to go away and study economics before lecturing investors.
By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News website Imperial College London and the World Health Organization analysed lifespans in 35 industrialised countries. It predicted all would see people living longer in 2030 and the gap between men and women would start to close in most countries. The researchers said the findings posed big challenges for pensions and care for elderly people. "South Korea has gotten a lot of things right," Prof Majid Ezzati told the BBC News website. "They seem to have been a more equal place and things that have benefited people - education, nutrition - have benefited most people. "And so far, they are better at dealing with hypertension and have some of the lowest obesity rates in the world." The data also forecasts that Japan, once the picture of longevity, will tumble down the global rankings. It currently has the highest life expectancy for women, but will be overtaken by both South Korea and France, the study suggests. Meanwhile, male life expectancy will go from the fourth highest to 11th out of the countries studied. The US also performs poorly and is on course to have the lowest life expectancy of rich countries by 2030. The study predicts an average age of 80 for men and 83 for women - roughly the same state Mexico and Croatia will have achieved. "They are almost opposite of South Korea," added Prof Ezzati. "[Society in the US is] very unequal to an extent the whole national performance is affected - it is the only country without universal health insurance. "And it is the first country that has stopped growing taller, which shows something about early life nutrition." The US will be overtaken by Chile, where women born in 2030 will expect to live for 87 years and men for 81. Between 2015 and 2030, life expectancy in the UK is expected to go from 79 to 82 for men and from 83 to 85 for women. Men catching up The study, published in the Lancet, also shows the gap in life expectancy between women and men is closing. Prof Ezzati said: "Men traditionally had unhealthier lifestyles, and so shorter life expectancies. "They smoked and drank more, and had more road traffic accidents and homicides, however, as lifestyles become more similar between men and women, so does their longevity." Much of the increases are due to improvements for the over-65s rather than reductions in deaths during childhood. The study made the projections in a similar way to the methods used by meteorologists to forecast the weather. It combined 21 separate mathematical models that analysed past trends to make projections into the future. This approach indirectly takes account of all the different factors - smoking rates, medical advances, obesity patterns - that are changing life expectancy. It assumes countries continue to progress as they are, so exceptional, unpredictable events equivalent to the fall of the Soviet Union, or huge breakthroughs like a vaccine for all cancer, would massively alter the forecasts. In summary, Prof Ezzati said: "Places that perform well do so by investing in their health system and making sure it reaches everyone." Follow James on Twitter.
After taking the oath at the Istana Negara palace in Kuala Lumpur, he told reporters his focus would be on the country's finances. The former strongman has become, at 92, the world's oldest elected leader. He came out of retirement and defected to the opposition to take on and beat former protege Najib Razak. His historic win ousted the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which has been in power since independence in 1957. What other policies did he outline? Dr Mahathir took his oath of office before the king, Sultan Muhammad V. The new prime minister was accompanied by his wife, Siti Hasmah Mohammed Ali. Addressing the media, he pledged that Malaysia would remain a "friendly trading nation" and he would work to keep the currency, the ringgit, as "steady as possible". He said he would seek the return of millions of dollars lost in a corruption scandal at 1Malaysian Development Berhad (1MDB), a state investment fund set up by Mr Najib. "We believe that we can get most of the 1MDB money back," he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency, adding: "We have to increase the confidence of investors in the administration." He renewed his promise to seek to have his former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, released and pardoned. When Dr Mahathir was previously in power, Anwar was jailed for corruption and sodomy after calling for economic and political reforms. He was released in 2004 but jailed again under Mr Najib in 2015. He is currently due for release next month. What was the scale of the victory? Investment analyst Aninda Mitra told Reuters news agency the shock of the election outcome had been as great as "Brexit and the Trump election". Official results show Dr Mahathir's Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) coalition secured 113 of the 222 seats being contested, including some which have only ever been held by the government. BN took 79 seats. Rising living costs and long-running allegations of corruption had weighed heavily on many voters and saw them peel away from Mr Najib and his once unshakeable coalition. How are people taking Mahathir's return? "We feel so united tonight," student Abdul Aziz Hamzah, 24, told AFP news agency in the crowd of jubilant supporters outside the palace. "Mahathir is so insightful and experienced because he's been here before." Fahmi Fadzil, an MP from the winning coalition, told the BBC Dr Mahathir inspired excitement about Malaysia's future. "Today he has created, along with other Pakatan Harapan leaders, a resurgence in faith in Malaysia," he said. "The polling centres that I visited, there was a sense of euphoria among people who cast their vote. Members of the press that I had met, some of them said that they cried when they heard that we had won. "There is very real change happening in Malaysia. Finally we can believe in the country again."

He was prime minister, at the head of the BN coalition, for 22 years, from 1981 until he stepped down in 2003. Under his leadership, Malaysia became one of the Asian tigers - the group of countries which saw their economies expand rapidly in the 1990s. However, he was an authoritarian figure who used controversial security laws to lock up his political opponents. Where did Najib fall down? Dr Mahathir was also a mentor to Mr Najib, who became prime minister in 2008. But Mr Najib was accused of pocketing some $700m (£520m) from the 1MDB but vehemently denied the allegations and was cleared by Malaysian authorities. The fund, meanwhile, is still being investigated by several countries. Mr Najib was also accused of stifling Malaysian investigations by removing key officials from their posts. Those allegations led to Dr Mahathir's surprise defection in 2016 from BN to join the Pakatan Harapan, saying he was "embarrassed" to be associated "with a party that is seen as supporting corruption". Then in January, he said he would run for the leadership again. But despite his historic win, uncertainty hangs over his tenure. Prior to his win, he intended to govern for two years before stepping down. 'Mountain of challenges' By Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent This morning Malaysia has woken to an entirely new situation, the first transfer of power in its history, albeit to a very familiar leader. But there are huge unknowns. How willingly will BN, the coalition which has, in various forms, run the country since independence and embedded itself into all areas of governance, relinquish power? How well will a disparate coalition, united largely by their desire to oust Najib Razak, work together in government? How smoothly will the plan to gain a pardon for imprisoned opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, and then for Mr Mahathir to hand the premiership to him within two years, actually proceed? And how will they treat Mr Najib, and his high-spending wife, both accused of greed and corruption? After all the jubilation over an impressive act of defiance by Malaysian voters, there is a mountain of challenges to face.
By Yolande KnellBBC News, Doha A year ago, Qatar had no dairy herd - relying on milk imported from Saudi Arabia. Now, Baladna farm has 10,000 cattle. Most come from top breeders in the United States. The first cows were flown in on Qatar Airways, a month after the start of the Gulf crisis, when this tiny state was put under a land blockade by its Arab neighbours. They have become a symbol of national pride for Qatar in its new push for self-reliance. "Everybody said it cannot be done and we have done it," says Peter Weltevreden who manages the farm. "Our promise was that a year after the siege we would be self-sufficient in fresh milk." On 5 June last year, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off all diplomatic, trade and transport links to Qatar. They accused it of supporting terrorism, stirring up regional instability and seeking close ties with their arch-rival, Iran. Qatar denied that and refused to comply with a long list of demands, including closing its Al Jazeera news network. This wealthy emirate has since used its vast riches from offshore gas to find ways around its isolation, and sees the boycott as a challenge to its sovereignty. "The main thing that the blockading states are aiming for [is] a power consolidation in the region," Qatar's Foreign Minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, tells me. "They started to draw the picture of terrorist on anyone who is different from them." Old enmity Qatar blames the start of last year's crisis on what it says was a cyber-attack on its state-run news agency, which published comments purportedly from the ruling emir. He was quoted as expressing sympathy for Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza, and claiming that Donald Trump might not last long as US president. However, analysts say the roots of the disagreement go back much further. "This was an issue that was kept bottled for 20 years but it just came out in the open a year ago," says Ali Shihabi, the Saudi founder of the Washington-based, Arabia Foundation. He refers to tapes that emerged after the fall of Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 which appeared to show the Qatari emir's father plotting against Saudi royals when he was ruler. Mr Shihabi says that Qatar reneged on agreements to stop payments to dissidents in other Arab countries and gave them a platform on Al Jazeera. "Qatar with 300,000 citizens has taken on the 22 million citizens of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt, the biggest Arab country by far," Mr Shihabi says. "It is a little brother and you shouldn't play bigger than you are, because ultimately that backfires and causes problems." Turning to Iran For now, Qatar is finding ways around the land blockade. It opened a new $7bn (£5.2nb) port on the Gulf coast, earlier than previously planned. This is helping to shield its economy from sanctions imposed by its neighbours. The port is now being used to import building materials for the 2022 World Cup stadiums, keeping construction on track. But Qatar is also being pushed closer to Iran - with which it shares a maritime border and its largest gas field. Qatari planes now rely on access to Iranian airspace. "Iran is our neighbour. We have to have co-operation and communication with them," says Mr al-Thani. "We have differences with them on policies in the region but this cannot be solved by confrontation." The US - which initially backed the Saudi-led side in this dispute - has recently been calling for Arab Gulf unity as it tries to build support for new sanctions against Iran. There is a large US military airbase in Qatar. Patriotic fervour In Doha's historic market, Souq Waqif, Qataris hope for an end to the blockade which has cut them off from relatives and friends from other parts of the region. "The Gulf states are all connected through marriages," says one man, who has a Saudi wife, now unable to visit her mother in Riyadh. "It's painful to be separated from our families." However, there is defiance too and a renewed sense of patriotism. Children in the market carry helium balloons with pictures of the young emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. His face is displayed on car stickers, mugs, T-shirts and skyscrapers across the bay. At 84, Saad Al-Jassim remembers a time long before his nation was rich. A former pearl diver, also known for his feats as a strongman, he says Qatar must stand firm. "We are now much, much better than before. What we were going to buy from [others] we are now making it here," he says. "It's my country, I love it and I know that it's better than the others [by a] hundred times."
Carrie GracieFormer China editor@BBCCarrieon Twitter With it comes another demonstration of how adept Beijing is becoming at inching back and forth along the policy tightrope it has installed between Washington and Pyongyang. At the same time, muttering mounts among Chinese experts and the public as to the wisdom of tightrope walking and the availability of alternatives. To placate the United States and signal displeasure with North Korea, China voted for the latest sanctions even as it insisted on watering them down to let Kim Jong-un know that China will not let him fall. Beijing does not believe that sanctions will force the North Korean leader to surrender his weapons. It wants Washington to talk to Pyongyang. And it wants Pyongyang to stop nuclear and missile tests. But neither is listening and with the North Korean tests accelerating and rhetoric on both sides escalating, the stakes are very high. The last war on the Korean peninsula pitted the US against China at a cost of millions of military and civilian lives. Unilateral pre-emptive military action by the US would risk conflict with China again. Despite deep frustration with Kim Jong-un, North Korea is a Chinese neighbour and ally, a fellow Leninist state with a shared victim narrative about the past and a shared ambition for the future to remove the US presence in North East Asia. Moreover, the chief objectives of the Chinese Communist Party are domestic: stability at home and its own firm grip on power. Its current assessment is that these objectives are best advanced by keeping Kim Jong-un in place. So while China does not want a nuclear North Korea, it wants a North Korean collapse even less and it will resist any sanctions which risk that outcome. Especially as it does not believe measures like a full oil embargo would push North Korea to disarm but instead force it further into a corner. Co-operation and mistrust It's hardly surprising that Beijing empathises with North Korean insecurity, given that for decades it suspected the US of plans for containment and regime change to remove the Chinese Communist Party. It wants the US to talk to the Kim regime as a first move in building trust. So co-operating with the latest round of strengthened sanctions is China's way of signalling its displeasure with what it sees as Pyongyang's reckless pursuit of nuclear and missile programmes. And a way to avoid accusations of complicity from Washington and any danger of its economy suffering significant damage from secondary sanctions against Chinese companies. But Beijing does not see sanctions as a route to greater security on the Korean peninsula. And while it carefully inches back and forth along its tightrope, the geopolitical landscape beneath is shifting. For example, North Korea's accelerated drive for nuclear weapons raises the question of whether and for how long South Korea and even Japan will remain non-nuclear. Already China has risked its previously burgeoning relationship with Seoul to punish it for deploying an American anti-missile system known as Thaad (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence). Even now Beijing fails to exploit the cracks that have emerged between President Donald Trump and South Korea's President Moon Jae-in because of its loathing for Thaad. But that missile defence system was deployed as a response to North Korea's weapons programme. A new arms race now threatens to undermine China's grand plans to ease the US out of North East Asia and dominate regional security. Nuclear weapons in South Korea or even Japanese hands may be next. With India, Russia and Pakistan already nuclear powers, not to mention the US, China may end up with more nuclear armed neighbours than any other country in the world. Chinese patience overstretched Strict censorship keeps public debate at bay, but there are signs of growing unease among experts and public alike, a growing number of voices pointing out that North Korea is getting away with undermining Chinese national interest. But it is hard for China to climb down from its practised tightrope act to tackle the underlying strategic landscape. Any lasting solution to the Korean problem will require greater trust between China and the US and sustained negotiations between all interested parties on long term security for the peninsula. They will have to discuss what a peace treaty would look like to conclude the Korean war, diplomatic recognition of Pyongyang, security guarantees, economic engagement and perhaps even in the long run the departure of US forces. The risks to China of such an endeavour would be very great, particularly as the partners are so singularly unpromising. On one hand an unpredictable US president whose policy seems to shift from tweet to tweet and day to day. On the other hand a ruthless and unscrupulous young dictator who has pointedly avoided visiting Beijing since coming to power, murdered those in his family who had close links with China and carefully timed his missile tests to embarrass Beijing. But even if the partners were different it is hard to imagine that China would be ready to address the profound questions about regional security which the North Korea crisis now throws up. Locked into an ever more nationalist narrative of its interests and destiny, it seems determined to double down on a 20th Century security strategy rather than to use this crisis to shape a new one.
Prime Minister David Cameron said MPs should respond to the Iraqi government's request for help. He added that the UK "should not turn away from what needs to be done". The Liberal Democrats are backing air strikes in Iraq and Labour leader Ed Miliband has confirmed his support, saying the UK cannot "opt out". Meanwhile, the Foreign Office has said it is "aware" of reports that a British national has died in Syria, but it has "no further information at this moment". IS - also known as Isil - has taken control of large areas of Iraq and Syria in recent months and seized several Western hostages. It has threatened to kill British aid volunteer Alan Henning, having released footage of the killing of another British man, David Haines, earlier this month. About 100 people attended a vigil for Mr Henning in Bolton earlier. 'Lawful' Mr Cameron, who is in the US, tweeted: "I have requested that Parliament be recalled to debate the UK response to the Iraqi Govt's request for support against Isil. The Speaker has accepted my request to recall Parliament on Friday." He later said: "What we are doing is legal and it is right. It does not involve British combat troops on the ground." He added that "when we are threatened in this way, we should not turn away from what needs to be done". "I'm confident we will get this through on an all-party basis," Mr Cameron said. "If there was a question of taking action against Isil in Syria, it would be a separate parliamentary debate. I want to be very clear about that." Mr Cameron addressed the United Nations General Assembly in New York, saying: "We need a response that involves every part of government and society - and every country involved in the widest possible international coalition. "There are no easy answers or quick fixes. We will be dealing with the effects of this threat for years." BBC deputy political editor James Landale said the government was "confident" of winning Friday's vote for air strikes in Iraq, but MPs would want Mr Cameron to be clear about what he hoped to achieve. Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg told the BBC his party would support air strikes in Iraq. He said they were "legal" and the UK would be "part of a much bigger coalition, a whole array of countries, crucially including a number of Arab countries which deprives Isil of the ability to somehow portray it as a west verses the rest crusade". How recalls happen By Shelley Phelps, BBC political research unit If government ministers want the Commons to meet when it is in recess they must ask the speaker to make a decision on whether or not to recall MPs to Parliament. If the speaker agrees that the request is in the public interest, he will then decide what time and day the Commons should meet and send out a notice to MPs. This can be issued as late as the day before the recall. MPs do not have the power to ask the speaker for the Commons to be recalled. The Commons was last recalled on 29 August 2013 to debate a motion on Syria. This was the 27th recall during a recess since 1948. Mr Cameron will open Friday's debate, due to start at 10:30 BST, and Mr Clegg will close it, with a vote expected at 17:30 BST. Conservative MPs have had a three-line whip imposed on them, meaning they will be compelled to back air strikes. A Labour source said its MPs were expected to "support our position". The cabinet is meeting to discuss the situation on Thursday. Mr Miliband said: "We will be supporting the government on air strikes by Britain in Iraq. "Isil is a murderous organisation. It's a murderous organisation against people of all nationalities and all religions. It is a threat directly to the stability of that region, and indeed to Britain because it can be a breeding ground for terrorism. I think is those circumstances we can't turn away from that threat." But UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said that, if the prime minister was proposing that the "we join Obama in a mission, simply a bombing mission, then that on its own will not work". He added: "It's got to be a regional policy. You'll never win a war without boots on the ground and frankly I'm not prepared to put British boots on the ground. So we need to work with all those different Arab nations and if they're prepared to put the boots on the ground then we'll provide expertise, we'll provide special forces and some things like that." The US and five countries from the Gulf and Middle East have begun bombing IS in Syria. Mr Cameron lost a Commons vote in August last year over proposed air strikes in response to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons. BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that, because of Labour concerns, Parliament would be asked to approve UK involvement in military action in Iraq, but not in Syria. The UK is already providing arms and surveillance support to Kurdish forces who are battling IS.
Moody's said the result would herald "a prolonged period of uncertainty". Meanwhile, PM David Cameron is under pressure to speed up "divorce" talks with the EU after Brussels said exit negotiations should start immediately. EU head Jean-Claude Juncker said it was "not an amicable divorce", but it was "not a deep love affair anyway". Moody's said the referendum result would have "negative implications for the country's medium-term growth outlook", and it lowered the UK's long-term issuer and debt ratings to "negative" from "stable". Tipped favourite It added: "In Moody's view, the negative effect from lower economic growth will outweigh the fiscal savings from the UK no longer having to contribute to the EU budget." It also said the UK had one of the largest budget deficits among advanced economies. Colin Ellis, chief credit officer at Moody's, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK's credit rating could have an impact on UK households in the long term. "The government borrowing rate is normally the benchmark - it is the rate at which other interest rates in the economy are set," he said. "A lower rating would typically correspond to higher borrowing costs, and that would be felt not just by the government but by businesses and households in the longer term." The financial assessment came after the UK voted to leave the EU in historic referendum on Thursday. Analysis By Will Smale, business reporter Credit rating agencies, in essence, rate a country on the strength of its economy. More specifically, they score governments (or large companies) on how likely they are to pay back their debt. The higher a credit rating, the cheaper it is for a country to borrow money in the international markets. So, in theory, when a government wants to borrow money, a high credit rating means a lower interest rate (and vice versa). There are three main ratings agencies - Moody's, S&P and Fitch. The last two have yet to issue a comment on the UK post-referendum. Credit rating agencies also give each country a specific credit rating score. In the case of Moody's and the UK, it currently scores the UK at "Aa1". This is the second highest rating in Moody's scale, and stands for "high grade", below "AAA" which is "prime". By changing its outlook to "negative", Moody's has warned that the UK's "Aa1" rating may be at risk of being lowered. Mr Cameron had urged the country to vote Remain in Thursday's referendum but was defeated by 52% to 48%. On Friday morning, he stood outside 10 Downing Street alongside his wife Samantha to announce he would remain in place for the short term and then hand over to a new prime minister by the Conservative conference in October. He said he would attempt to "steady the ship" over the coming weeks and months. However, the PM said it would be for a new prime minister to carry out negotiations with the EU and invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, the formal procedure that will take Britain out of the EU, a process that will take a minimum of two years. But in an interview with German TV, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: "Britons decided yesterday that they want to leave the European Union, so it doesn't make any sense to wait until October to try to negotiate the terms of their departure - I would like to get started immediately." He said the EU would pursue a "reasonable approach" in negotiating the separation. Earlier, Mr Cameron was given assurances from US President Barack Obama that the UK would remain "an indispensable partner". In a telephone call, the US leader told Mr Cameron that he regretted the PM's decision to step aside, saying he was "a trusted partner and friend". A White House spokesman later said Mr Obama "stands by what he said" about the UK going to "the back of the queue" when it comes to trade deals with the US. He gave the warning while on a visit to the UK during the referendum campaign. The result of the referendum - which saw more than 30 million people turn out to vote - saw British bank shares lose nearly a third of their value before rallying on Friday afternoon. Retailers and the AA motoring organisation warned that petrol prices were likely to rise by 2p-3p a litre because of the pound's fall against the dollar. Boris Johnson, the leading voice in the Leave campaign is favourite to be the next Tory leader and prime minister, although he has yet to announce his candidacy, with Home Secretary Theresa May also seen as being in the running. Britain's vote to quit the EU has also prompted fresh calls for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to resign, amid claims he did not do enough to convince Labour supporters to vote for Remain. The referendum result could also trigger a second independence referendum in Scotland, which wants to stay in the EU. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was "democratically unacceptable" to force Scotland, which voted strongly to remain in the EU, out of the bloc against its will. A meeting of 27 EU leaders has been scheduled for Wednesday to discuss Britain's exit - but Mr Cameron is not invited.
By Owen Amos and Hideharu TamuraBBC News Because the Yokohama captain, Kazuyoshi Miura, was 53 years old. Miura's never-ending career fascinates football fans around the world. His contract extensions are reported by the BBC and CNN. He holds the Guinness record for “world’s oldest goalscorer”. Even his inclusion in the FIFA 20 computer game – after first appearing in it 24 years ago – made headlines. So who is “King Kazu” and why does he keep playing? What’s the secret to a football career that is at least 15 years longer than average? The story, he told the BBC, began with the 1970 World Cup, Pele, and an 8mm camera. Miura grew up in a football family in Shizuoka, where the game has long been popular. His older brother Yasutoshi also became a professional, and their father was an avid fan. “My father was in Mexico in 1970 to watch the World Cup,” Miura says, speaking via a translator. “He filmed the matches by 8mm video camera. At that time, Pele was playing, and I grew up watching the video taken by my father.” Miura was only three in 1970, but the home-made video, looping over and over, had a lasting impact. “I became a fan of Brazilian football,” he says. “From the time I was a little boy, I wanted to live as a professional player.” Miura’s father had links to Brazil and the teenager left school in Shizuoka aged 15 to move there. “At that time there was no J-League [the professional Japanese league that began in 1993],” Miura recalls. “So there was no way of becoming a professional soccer player in Japan.” He signed for Juventus, a professional team in Sao Paulo, but it was not an easy start. He lived in a dormitory with other youth players, aged 15 to 20, and spoke little Portuguese. “I couldn’t understand the language, and the customs were different, so naturally I felt lonely,” Miura says. “The first three months was really hard.” But he was determined to improve. He threw himself into training sessions. He learned Portuguese. He made friends. He had to succeed in Brazil because, really, there was no Plan B. When asked whether there was an alternative career, had football not worked out, he pauses. “I don’t have any idea,” he says, eventually. “All I wanted was to be a football player. So this is the hardest question to answer.” In 1986, three years after moving to Brazil, Miura signed for Santos, where Pele – star of those 8mm videos – played most of his career. He stayed in Brazil, at a number of clubs, for more than four years. He returned to Japan in 1990, a bona fide superstar. In 1993, the J-League’s first season, Miura was named most valuable player – beating, among others, England’s Gary Lineker. In 1994, he moved on loan to Genoa in Italy, becoming the first Japanese player in Serie A. He needed surgery after his first game – he hit the back of Italian legend Franco Baresi’s head – scored only one goal, and stayed only one season. But his spell in Italy only increased his status back home. “It’s hard to overstate his importance,” says Sean Carroll, a football journalist in Japan. “He is intrinsically tied up with the birth and development of professional football in Japan… he has achieved a god-like status, in some ways I guess similar to [Diego] Maradona in Argentina," Carroll says. “There is a whole generation of professional players, maybe even two generations now, who cite him as their role model when they were kids.” But why is he still playing? In 2005 – aged 38 – Miura signed for his current club, Yokohama FC, in the Japanese second division. He became a key player, playing 39 times as the team won promotion to the top division in 2006. Although they were relegated after one season, Miura remained a regular for Yokohama in the second tier well into his 40s. In 2016, he played 20 times, scoring twice. He was 49 years old. Miura rarely gets injured (except when running into Franco Baresi) and is renowned for his fitness regime. He speaks to the BBC after training, in a dressing gown, holding an ice pack to his leg. “For sure, it takes me longer than the younger players to recover,” he says. “But even though it’s very hard, I have this passion of wanting to play, so that keeps me going.” And, as well as his fitness, there’s another reason for Miura’s ultra-long career – his popularity. In 1998, just before Japan’s first World Cup, Miura was dropped from the squad, adding a layer of sympathy to his superstar status. But more importantly, he is known for simply being a nice person. The editor of J Soccer magazine, Alan Gibson, first met Miura in 1993, and went on to referee him a number of times in friendly games when he played for Vissel Kobe in the early 2000s. “He was a gentleman on the field – I really enjoyed refereeing him,” says Gibson. “Everyone loves him. Although he’s ‘the King’, he didn’t make the World Cup. And, as he played for Yokohama for so long, he hasn’t recently won a championship with a team everyone hates.” That popularity makes more people watch Yokohama games – “If they know he’s playing, an extra 3,000 or 4,000 people turn up,” says Gibson – and encourages a number of sponsors. That links to a final reason for Miura’s longevity: the respectful – or perhaps sentimental – streak than runs through Japanese society. One coach, while praising Miura, tells the BBC that “King Kazu” has become a “panda bear” at Yokohama – that is, a rare, much-loved curiosity, rather than a serious player. Despite playing twice in the League Cup, he has not played in the league this season, and only played three times last year. Sean Carroll says Miura's experience is important in the Yokohama dressing room, but agrees that his ultra-long career says something about Japanese society more widely. “Hierarchy is incredibly important in Japan anyway, but when you’ve contributed as much as Kazu, he pretty much has a contract as long as he wants one,” he says. “The idea of him ‘working hard’ and ‘acting as an inspiration’ is oft-repeated by fans and the media – fulfilling a kind of ‘anything-is-possible’ fairy tale. Which again, reflects Japanese culture at large.” Even that, though, doesn’t quite explain Miura’s longevity. After all, it’s not the supporters, or the sponsors, who push through the pain barrier, day in, day out, aged 53. Miura is often asked what the “secret” is to his career. He insists there is no secret – other than hard work and dedication. But perhaps the secret comes in the answer to the final question. Does 53-year-old Kazu, training every day in Yokohama, enjoy kicking a ball as much as the 15-year-old boy who flew to Brazil with a few words of Portuguese and head full of dreams? “Yes, I still enjoy playing football – every moment,” he says. “Really, I enjoy it even more than when I was in Brazil.”
HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Swiss bank UBS and US banks JP Morgan Chase, Citibank and Bank of America have all been fined. A separate probe into Barclays is continuing. The fines were issued by the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and two US regulators. The country's Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issued fines of $1.4bn to five banks, while the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) added $950m in further fines to three lenders. Separately, the Swiss regulator, FINMA, has penalised UBS 134m Swiss francs. Barclays, which had been expected to announce a similar deal to the other banks, said it would not be settling at this time. "After discussions with other regulators and authorities, we have concluded that it is in the interests of the company to seek a more general coordinated settlement," it said in a statement. FCA boss Martin Wheatley told the BBC: "This isn't the end of the story." "The individuals themselves will face the consequences," he said. Several senior traders at the banks have already been put on leave and the Serious Fraud Office is in the process of preparing potential criminal charges against those alleged to have masterminded the scheme. Failings 'undermine confidence' The fines follow a 13-month investigation by regulators into claims that the foreign exchange market - in which banks and other financial firms buy and sell currencies between one another - was being rigged. The massive market, in which $5.3 trillion worth of currencies are traded daily, dwarfs the stock and bond markets. About 40% of the world's dealing is estimated to go through trading rooms in London. There is no physical forex marketplace and nearly all trading takes place on electronic systems operated by the big banks and other providers. Daily "spot benchmarks" known as "fixes" are used by a wide range of financial and non-financial firms to, for example help value assets or manage currency risk. The FCA fined the five banks a total of £1.1bn, the largest fine imposed by it or its predecessor, the Financial Services Authority. "At the heart of today's action is our finding that the failings at these banks undermine confidence in the UK financial system and put its integrity at risk," the FCA said. The US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has fined the same banks a total of more than $1.4bn (£900m). "The setting of a benchmark rate is not simply another opportunity for banks to earn a profit. Countless individuals and companies around the world rely on these rates to settle financial contracts," said the CFTC's director of enforcement Aitan Goelman. Another US regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), fined Citibank, JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America a further $950m (£600m). All three regulators found the attempted manipulation of the foreign exchange market had been going on for several years, with the FCA saying the failings occurred between 1 January 2008 and 15 October 2013. The CFTC said its investigation found the traders' misconduct took place between 2009 and 2012. They found certain foreign exchange traders at the banks had coordinated their trading with one another to attempt to manipulate benchmark foreign exchange rates. The CFTC said traders had used private online chat rooms to communicate. They had disclosed confidential customer order information and trading positions, and altered their positions accordingly to "benefit the interests of the collective group". The FCA said the "tight knit groups" formed by traders at the different banks had described themselves as "the 3 musketeers", "the A-team" and "1 team, 1 dream". It said traders had attempted to manipulate the relevant currency rate in the market, for example to ensure that the rate at which the bank had agreed to sell a particular currency to its clients was higher than the average rate it had bought the currency. "If successful, the bank would profit," the FCA added. CFTC example of private chat room conversation: Bank R Trader: 4:00:35 pm: well done gents Bank W Trader 1: 4:01:56 pm: hooray nice team work Bank U Trader: 4:02:22 pm: nice one mate Another example: Bank V Trader: 4:00:51 pm: have that my son Bank V Trader: 4:00:52 pm: hahga Bank V Trader: 4:00:56 pm: v nice mate Bank U Trader: 4:04:53 pm: that worked nice mate Bank V Trader: 4:05:44 p.m.: big time mate. CFTC's examples of misconduct in private chat rooms How the forex scandal happened Forex scandal: How to rig the market The banks all issued statements following the fines: Chancellor George Osborne said the fines "would be used for the wider public good". "Today we take tough action to clean up corruption by a few so that we have a financial system that works for everyone. It's part of a long-term plan that is fixing what went wrong in Britain's banks and our economy," he added. However, Professor Mark Taylor, a former foreign exchange trader and now dean at Warwick Business School, said the fines were "relatively small beer for banks that regularly report billions of dollars in annual profit". "The interesting thing is that there are no individuals named as yet, and no individual prosecutions. This is still a possibility and it will be interesting to see how that pans out. At the moment, it's really only the shareholders - which in the case of RBS means British taxpayers - who suffer from these fines," he added. For the opposition, shadow chancellor Ed Balls described the affair as "yet another shocking scandal involving the banks and underlines the need for fundamental reform and cultural change". "This report shows that reform of our banks has a long way to go. We need reforms to pay and bonuses, with more transparency, greater clawback and a tax on bank bonuses," he added. Bank of England cleared Separately, the Bank of England - which had been accused of knowing about the foreign exchange scandal, but doing nothing about it - published a separate report by Lord Grabiner, clearing its officials. "There was no evidence that any Bank of England official was involved in any unlawful or improper behaviour in the FX [foreign exchange] market," it said. It said the suspension of the Bank's chief dealer in March, and his subsequent dismissal on 11 November was unrelated to the foreign exchange scandal. "The individual's dismissal was as a result of information that came to light during the course of the Bank's initial internal review into allegations relating to the FX market and Bank staff. This information related to the Bank's internal policies, not to FX," a Bank spokesperson said.
Police said they arrested the man in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, following searches. Suicide bomber Salman Abedi killed 22 - including children - and injured 64 at an Ariana Grande concert on Monday. The bomber's father, Ramadan, and younger brother, Hashem, have been detained by militia in Libya. His older brother, Ismail, was detained in Chorlton, south Manchester, on Tuesday. The fifth UK arrest on Wednesday - in Wigan - involved a man who was carrying a package that is now being "assessed", police said. Eyewitness Connor Britton told the BBC the man had been held by "undercover armed police". He said workers in his office had been told to stay inside and lock their windows, and that a red package had been "moved to a clear part of the street". The UK terror threat level is now at its highest level of "critical", meaning more attacks may be imminent. Military personnel are being deployed to protect key sites after the UK's terror threat level was raised on Tuesday night. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: "[Monday's attack] was more sophisticated than some of the attacks we've seen before, and it seems likely - possible - that [Abedi] wasn't doing this on his own." Meanwhile, the New York Times has obtained photos which it says were gathered by UK authorities at the scene of the attack, including the remnants of a backpack, nuts and screws, and a device identified as a "possible detonator". The paper says the alleged evidence suggests "a powerful, high-velocity charge, and a bomb in which its shrapnel was carefully and evenly packed". UK authorities have reacted with anger to the publication of the leaked pictures. One Whitehall source told the BBC there was "disbelief and astonishment" across Whitehall. A counter terrorism policing spokesperson said it was a breach of trust that undermined relationships with "trusted intelligence, law enforcement and security partners around the world" and undermined the confidence of victims, witnesses and their families. "This damage is even greater when it involves unauthorised disclosure of potential evidence in the middle of a major counter terrorism investigation," the spokesperson added. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said that the bomber is thought to have been a "mule", using a device built by someone else. In other developments: What's happening with the investigation? Seven people were arrested in the UK since Monday night, including Abedi's older brother Ismail, 23. He has since been released without charge. Younger brother Hashem, 20, was held by militia in the Libyan capital Tripoli, as was their father. Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, Greater Manchester Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said: "I think it's very clear that this is a network that we are investigating. "And as I've said, it continues at a pace. There's extensive investigations going on and activity taking place across Greater Manchester, as we speak." As part of their investigation, police raided a block of flats near Manchester Piccadilly station in the city centre, requiring them to carry out a controlled explosion and briefly close the railway line. Police carried out another controlled explosion in the early hours of Thursday morning at an address in the Moss Side area of Manchester. Anyone with information about the attack can call the anti-terror hotline on 0800 789321. Who are the victims? The victims include 14-year-old Sorrell Leczkowski, from Leeds, whose grandmother is critically injured in hospital. Others who died are mother-of-three Michelle Kiss, Nell Jones, 14, eight-year-old Saffie Roussos, Alison Howe, Lisa Lees, Jane Tweddle-Taylor, 51, Martyn Hett, 29, and Olivia Campbell, 15. Kelly Brewster, 32, John Atkinson, 28, Georgina Callander - thought to be 18 - and Marcin and Angelika Klis, a Polish couple from York, have also been named. South Shields couple Chloe Rutherford, 17, and Liam Curry, 19 have been named among the dead. Family members paid tribute to the teenagers and in a statement issued by police said: "They wanted to be together forever and now they are". Some of the victims had been making their way outside at the end of the gig when Abedi detonated his "nuts-and-bolts" bomb. Others had been waiting in the foyer to pick up children and family. A serving Cheshire police officer - off-duty at the time - was also among those killed. She has not yet been named. The BBC understands her partner is critically ill and his two children were injured. Of the 64 injured, 20 are in a critical condition. Twelve of them are children. Mr Hopkins said the families of all those injured had been contacted. Who was the attacker? Salman Abedi is understood to have been a 22-year-old born in Manchester to Libyan parents, and a former University of Salford student. He attended Burnage Academy for Boys in Manchester between 2009 and 2011, and The Manchester College until 2013. Hamid El-Said, who worked for the UN on tackling radicalisation and now works at Manchester Metropolitan University, said Abedi had had a "really bad relationship" with his family and his parents had tried but failed to keep him on the "right path". "Eventually he was doing very bad at his university, at his education, and he didn't complete, and they tried to take him back to Libya several times. He had difficulties adjusting to European lifestyle," he said. A former classmate of Abedi's told the BBC that he was a "very jokey lad" but also "very short tempered" and would get angry at "the littlest thing". The man, who did not want to be identified, said Abedi had hung around "the wrong crowd and was very, very gullible". Before leaving Burnage Academy in 2011, Abedi had become "more and more religious", the man added. A Muslim community worker, who did not want to be identified, has told the BBC that two people who had known Abedi at college had made separate calls to a hotline to warn the police about his extremist views. He said they had been worried that Abedi was "supporting terrorism" and he had expressed the view that "being a suicide bomber was ok". The calls are thought to have been made five years ago, he added. What does a 'critical' threat level mean? Prime Minister Theresa May said soldiers are being placed at Buckingham Palace, Downing Street, embassies and the Palace of Westminster to support armed police in protecting the public. Military personnel may also be seen at other events over the coming weeks, such as concerts, Mrs May said, in what she is calling a "proportionate and sensible response". Home Secretary Amber Rudd said 984 troops had been deployed in the first instance. Up to 3,800 are available. She said she expected the raising of the threat level to critical to be temporary, adding that the bomber had been known "up to a point" by the intelligence services. The highest threat level has been reached only twice before: in 2006 during an operation to stop a plot to blow up transatlantic airliners, and a year later when security chiefs were hunting for the men who tried to bomb a London nightclub and attacked Glasgow Airport. The Metropolitan Police says it has increased its presence across London, and freed up an extra 1,000 armed officers to patrol crowded places, key sites and transport hubs across the UK. The Palace of Westminster has been closed to the public following police advice, and will not re-open until further notice, its website said.
The 25-year-old eldest granddaughter of Emperor Akihito will become engaged to law firm worker Kei Komuro, also 25, whom she met while studying together. Japan's imperial law requires a princess to leave the royal family after marrying a commoner. The move is expected to reignite debate on royal succession, with the emperor also possibly abdicating soon. Ten things about Japan's emperor Princess Mako and Kei Komuro met in 2012 at a restaurant, when they were both studying at the International Christian University in Tokyo. What happens now? The Imperial Household told local media that plans were under way for the princess's engagement. The engagement will only be official after a ceremonial exchange of gifts, local media said. Public broadcaster NHK said the wedding is expected to take place next year. Asked about their engagement plans, Mr Komuro on Wednesday was quoted as saying: "Now is not the time for me to comment, but I want to speak at the right time." Has this ever happened before? Yes, Princess Mako's aunt Princess Sayako married a commoner in 2005 - the first time a Japanese royal became a commoner. Her wedding to an urban planner for the Tokyo city government, was described as a low key event. And Sayako was left to adjust to her more humble surrounding. She moved into a one-bedroom apartment, had to learn how to drive, shop in a supermarket and buy furniture. Princess Sayako is the only daughter of Emperor Akihito. How does this affect the royal family? Emperor Akihito, 83, hinted last August that he wanted to stand down, saying his age could interfere with his duties. No Japanese emperor has abdicated for two centuries and the law currently does not allow it, but Japan is currently considering legal changes to allow the emperor to abdicate. However, the new legislation is expected to leave unchanged a males-only succession law - which has been at the centre of debate for many years. Because of that law there are only four heirs to the Chrysanthemum Throne: Akihito's sons Crown Prince Naruhito and Prince Fumihito, Prince Hisahito (Fumihito's son) and the emperor's younger brother, Prince Masahito. After news of Princess Mako's upcoming engagement broke, Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying: "There is no change in our view to proceed with consideration of steps to ensure stable imperial succession."
Jonathan MarcusDiplomatic correspondent@Diplo1on Twitter Small numbers of foreign nationals are already ill. Governments whose citizens abroad have been unlucky to be caught up are weighing up the dilemmas of repatriation and isolating those who may be carriers of the virus once home. Some countries have closed their borders to Chinese nationals altogether. And, in some quarters, there has - perhaps inevitably - been an unpleasant and quite unfair stigmatisation of China and the Chinese. The immediate economic impact of the crisis is also apparent. In the first place those industries that depend upon the movement of goods and people - tourism, airlines, the operators of cruise ships and commercial shipping lines - are already suffering. The crisis has thrown into stark relief the global supply chain behind many of the products we take for granted. The supply of mobile phones, microprocessors, spare parts for the motor industry may all be interrupted. Even the service sector, for example foreign universities who have set up off-shoots in China, will find its income threatened. How long this will all last is impossible to say. So too its ramifications for Beijing. It depends upon how the epidemic plays out. As Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Washington think-tank the Center for Strategic and International Studies, notes: "The impact on perception of Xi Jinping at home and abroad will depend on the duration of the virus and its impact on the Chinese economy." "If the Chinese Communist Party can control the spread of the epidemic and end the crisis," she argues, "few people inside China will continue to criticise the party for its initial slow response and efforts to cover up the outbreak." Many countries who have sought investment from China as part of its Belt and Road initiative will continue to do so, she told me. "They'll continue to want Chinese loans for infrastructure projects since there aren't other sources of financing." But what may be the lasting impact of the crisis? To what extent could it change perceptions of China and especially of President Xi Jinping himself and indeed the whole direction in which he is taking his country? How could the fallout from the coronavirus impact the key relationship between Beijing and Washington? And with clear signs of a technological "cold war" already developing between the US and China - the battle over 5G and artificial intelligence - could the tensions surrounding the virus outbreak make things worse? So first of all what does the crisis tell us about China itself? Elizabeth Economy, director for Asia Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, says that inside China there are essentially two distinct narratives. "The first, which is already being advanced by China's diplomatic corps, is that China has taken extraordinary measures to contain the virus - both for the sake of its own people and as a gift to the rest of the world," she says. These actions, they say, "are enabled by China's particular top-down authoritarian model". But then there is a second narrative, Economy argues, that says, "China lost precious time in addressing the crisis because of its political system and its determination to silence independent voices." "Also under Xi Jinping, local officials have become more afraid to acknowledge that things are not going well. This too has hampered an effective response." As a long-time China-watcher, Elizabeth Economy told me that what she found especially concerning was "that even in the wake of Dr Li Wenliang's death, the Communist Party continues to hunt down independent voices". Dr Li was seen by many in China as a whistleblower and hero; the man who first highlighted the threat posed by the Wuhan virus outbreak. He himself succumbed to the disease. "One might have hoped," says Economy, "that his death - and the popular response to it - would have signalled to the Chinese leadership the value of transparency and a more open civil society in mounting an effective response to a nationwide crisis." So much for perceptions inside China itself, but what about the rest of the world? Elizabeth Economy says that she does not think that the coronavirus will change perceptions of the Chinese government, rather she argues, "it will simply feed into pre-existing beliefs. Supporters will stress the impressive mobilisation of resources, while detractors will focus on the lack of transparency and concern over the accuracy of Chinese information." On the economic front though it could be significant, even just by throwing into stark relief things that we already know. The disease outbreak has underscored the significance of China to the global economy and the importance of diversified supply chains. And this, according to Elizabeth Economy, "will perhaps encourage more companies not to place too much of their manufacturing in China or rely too heavily on the Chinese consumer market." At the recent annual security conference that I attended in Munich, the shadow of the coronavirus and its likely impact upon the medium- and long-term relationship between Washington and Beijing overshadowed much of the debate. Ian Bremmer, founder and chief strategist of Eurasia Group, the leading political risk and consulting firm, told me that the crisis had the potential to significantly re-shape the US-China business relationship, though not exactly for the reasons that many people might think. "US companies," he told me, "have long been thinking about reducing supply chain exposure to China given increasing trade hostilities, in addition to a Chinese labour force that is increasingly expensive and inefficient." With coronavirus, he explains "US companies may now have the excuse they need to actually make that move. That's obviously an extreme example, but it's a very real prospect down the line, the longer coronavirus continues to cause mayhem." At the very least, he argues, "the coronavirus makes it highly unlikely that China will be able to fully implement the 'Phase One' trade deal it just signed with the US, further intensifying the trend of decoupling between the US and China." Bonnie Glaser agrees that China will have difficulty meeting the commitments it made in the "Phase One" deal. But, she argues, "the US will likely cut Beijing some slack". "With his eye on re-election," she notes, "President Trump will celebrate his achievement and seek to preserve good relations with Xi, while pledging to make more progress in 'Phase Two'. 2020," she says, "is going to be a year of treading water." Here we see the crucial inter-section of economics, diplomacy and domestic politics. Each has a part to play in the relationship between Washington and Beijing, but the salience or relative weight of each factor varies depending upon the circumstances. As Ian Bremmer notes, "for the time being, Trump has been quite positive about President Xi's handling of the situation". But, he argues, "that's largely been the result of Trump being relatively shielded from the fallout of the coronavirus crisis himself". All this could quite easily change, Bremmer asserts. "Should the coronavirus start having real economic impact in the US - and in an election year no less - we're more likely to see President Trump go after Xi much more aggressively. "And this won't just be empty rhetoric. Given the bipartisan hawkishness on China that already exists more broadly in the US these days", he concludes, "a Trump decision to turn on Xi would have real impact on the relationship between the world's only two economic superpowers." This bipartisan hostility to China was clearly in evidence at the Munich conference. The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, headed a large congressional delegation and she was outspoken against the Chinese, especially concerning technological rivalry. But to my ear this wasn't just about business or technology. There was a clear ideological element to the debate. Mark Esper, the US defence secretary, preferred to refer to the actions of the "Chinese Communist Party" rather than "China". Thus the coronavirus crisis has the potential to dramatically worsen the already deteriorating climate between Washington and Beijing. And this could have much broader consequences, not least for the Europeans (or indeed for Washington's Asian allies), who will be caught in the middle. I asked Ian Bremmer if what we saw in Munich - bullish interventions on China from Nancy Pelosi, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defence Secretary Esper - amounted to the declaration of a new global "high-technology cold war" between the US and China. "Close to it," was his answer. But he stressed that the Europeans had no interest in getting caught in the middle of this brewing high-tech cold war. "Indeed," he noted, "it's the first time in the transatlantic relationship you've ever seen the Americans and the Europeans in such disagreement over what their respective top national security concerns should be." This in turn could have a profound impact on the already somewhat strained relationship between the US and some of its Nato partners. "As much as the Americans may be gearing up for a 'cold war' vis-à-vis China on tech," Bremmer told me, "at the moment it's looking increasingly like a bilateral 'cold war' rather than a global one. And as the Americans begin to actually pivot to Asia on security matters and the Europeans don't, it's also looking likely that there are even rougher waters ahead for the transatlantic relationship." Correction 4 March 2020: An earlier version of this article referred to the Coronavirus as a pandemic. However the World Health Organization is not using this description and so this sentence has been amended.
The agent, known by the alias Jack King, infiltrated a group of pro-German activists in south-east England in a previously unknown wartime operation. His undercover work led to the identification of hundreds of people willing to pass secrets to the enemy. Files in the National Archives describe King as a "genius" at his work. In 1942, King - also referred to as SR in the files - met Marita Perigoe, described as a "crafty and dangerous woman" of Swedish and German origin. Despite being married to a member of Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists, she had no time for the group and regarded them as "insufficiently extreme". MI5 said of her: "She was found to be so violently anti-British and so anxious to do anything in her power to help the enemy that it was felt that special attention should be paid to her." It went on to say she was not a "neurotic nor feminine type; she is masterful and a somewhat masculine woman". "Both in appearance and mentality she can be described as an arrogant hun." King managed to convince her that he was a representative of the Gestapo looking for people who were "100% loyal to the Fatherland" and could be relied on in the event of an invasion. He exploited the group's taste for the cloak-and-dagger aspects of espionage work by offering them invisible ink for secret communications and arranging meetings in the basement of an antiques shop. MI5 regarded some members of the group as unstable but warned they were still dangerous. Hilda Leech was "unstable and neurotic" and was trying to pass on reports of highly secret research on jet aircraft, while astrologer Edgar Whitehead - a "bit of a mystery man" - was passing on information about secret trials on an amphibious tank. MI5 drew up plans to issue members with special badges to be worn in the event of an invasion - supposedly to identify them as friends to the Germans but in fact to enable them to be swiftly rounded up by the police. By the end of the war, Perigoe was one of six agents working directly to King - all but one of them British. MI5 estimated the number of their contacts who had been the subject of King's intelligence reports ran "certainly to scores and probably to hundreds". In other declassified files released by the National Archives, it emerged that English actor Michael Redgrave met Guy Burgess, one of the Cambridge spies, while his theatre group toured Moscow. The meeting in 1958 with his old friend from Cambridge University proved to be of interest to MI5, which was desperate to find out all it could about what was said. Burgess, who had fled to Russia seven years earlier, turned up drunk at the theatre where Redgrave was starring in Hamlet. 'Fine gossips' But the two had lunch together the following day at Burgess' flat, provided by the KGB after his defection. The British ambassador at the time said Redgrave had not been very communicative about the meeting and had not consulted the embassy about it beforehand. Burgess, however, wrote a letter home to his mother - intercepted by MI5 - delighting in the "fine gossips" shared and gushing over Redgrave's acting. "It's certainly the best Hamlet I've ever seen - better than Gielgud, better than Olivier, much better than Paul Schofield."
Redmayne thanked his "staggering partner in crime", co-star Felicity Jones, and his "ferocious but incredibly kind director James Marsh". Dark comedy Birdman won best film and best director for Mexican film-maker Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu. It also won best cinematography and best original screenplay. The film sees Michael Keaton play a former movie superhero actor, who hopes to revive his washed-up career by putting on a Broadway play. See all the updates from the night on our Oscars live page Moore used her speech to raise awareness for Alzheimer's disease - in Still Alice, she plays a 50-year-old who has early on-set Alzheimer's. "I'm so happy, I'm thrilled that we were able to shine a light on Alzheimer's disease," she said. "So many people who have this disease feel marginalised. People who have Alzheimer's disease deserve to be seen so we can find a cure." Redmayne was honoured for his portrayal of physicist Stephen Hawking, who has motor neurone disease (ALS). Accepting his award, he thanked the Hawking family, including Jane Hawking on whose book the film is based, and said his award belonged "to all of the people around the world battling ALS". Oscars 2015 The winners 4 awards for Birdman 4 awards for Grand Budapest Hotel 3 awards for Whiplash 2 acting awards for redheads - Eddie Redmayne and Julianne Moore Full Oscars coverage Oscars 2015 The losers 1 win out of eight nominations for The Imitation Game 1 win out of six nominations for Boyhood 1 win out of six nominations for American Sniper Richard Linklater's Boyhood won just one award from six nominations - best supporting actress - which went to Patricia Arquette. Arquette thanked "her Boyhood family" and "every woman who gave birth". "To every woman... we have fought for everybody else's equal rights. It's our time to have wage equality," she added, to huge applause from the audience. JK Simmons won best supporting actor for Whiplash, in which he played a strict drumming teacher at a music conservatory. Whiplash also won the award for best editing and best sound mixing. The Grand Budapest Hotel picked up best costume design (Milena Canonero), as well as best hair and make-up (British duo Frances Hannon and Mark Coulier). It also won best score and production design. Hannon thanked absent actor Bill Murray - who has a cameo in the film - for introducing her to director Wes Anderson on the set of his film Rushmore 17 years earlier. Another British duo, Matt Kirkby and James Lucas, picked up the award for best live short action film, The Phone Call, starring Sally Hawkins and Jim Broadbent. Alan Turing drama The Imitation Game, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, won best adapted screenplay. Best foreign language film went to Polish black and white family drama Ida. John Legend and Common's track Glory, from civil rights drama Selma, won best song. Legend used his time on stage to deliver a political message, saying: "We live in the most incarcerated country in the world... people are marching with our song... we are with you, march on." Emmanuel Lubezko's win for best cinematography for Birdman was his second Oscar in as many years - in 2014, he won the same award for his work on Gravity. Citizenfour, which chronicles one of the biggest intelligence leaks in American history, won best documentary feature. It shows former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden at the very moment he made his sensational revelations detailing extensive internet and phone surveillance by the US government. Best documentary short was won by Crisis Hotline: Veterans Press 1, about the counsellors who work with military veterans on a 24-hour phone helpline. Clint Eastwood's Iraq war drama American Sniper won the award for best sound editing. The 87th Academy Awards took place at Hollywood's 3,300-seat Dolby Theatre. Performers at this year's ceremony included Lady Gaga - who sang a medley of Sound of Music songs to celebrate the classic film's 50th year - Jennifer Hudson and Anna Kendrick. Host Neil Patrick Harris kicked off with a song which paid homage to Hollywood's film industry, accompanied by Kendrick and Jack Black. Birdman and Wes Anderson's quirky comedy The Grand Budapest Hotel began the night with nine nominations each, while The Imitation Game had eight. Clint Eastwood's true-life Iraq war tale American Sniper and Boyhood had six apiece. The best picture prize was widely predicted to either go to Birdman or Boyhood - both of which had been named best film at the many ceremonies leading up to Hollywood's biggest night. The directors of both films did their best on the red carpet to play down any rivalry with Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, who eventually won for Birdman, calling the supposed competition "so silly" and Linklater saying he loved Birdman. "It's a real tribute for two films that aren't traditional stories, crazy stories," said Linklater, who filmed the coming of age movie over 12 years with the same actors.
The report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) also said relocating the submarines would be far cheaper than previously assumed. But it could take a decade to build a base for the submarines elsewhere in the UK, it said. The SNP wants to remove nuclear weapons within four years of independence. The submarines carrying the UK's nuclear deterrent currently operate from the Faslane naval base on the Clyde. There have been concerns over how they could be relocated in the event of a "Yes" vote in September's independence referendum. Milford Haven in Wales and "the most obvious replacement", Devonport base in Plymouth, have been suggested as potential new homes for the submarines. Falmouth in Cornwall is named as a possible munitions site. Former cabinet minister Lord Forsyth has previously warned that the potential difficulties of moving the submarines would mean that the UK could be forced to give up its nuclear deterrent if Scotland votes in favour of independence. But in their paper, Rusi research analyst Hugh Chalmers and research director Malcolm Chalmers said relocating Trident would be both financially and technically feasible. They suggested that recreating the required nuclear facilities outside Scotland would add between £2.5-3.5bn to the cost of maintaining a nuclear-armed fleet, plus the cost of acquiring and clearing land. This would be far less than a previously-predicted £20-25bn, they said. Hugh Chalmers said the research by the military think tank contrasted with an "unlikely consensus" between supporters and opponents of Scottish independence that it would be impossible to relocate the nuclear weapons elsewhere. If the question mark over Trident's future could be answered, it would help untangle a difficult issue surrounding Scottish independence, he added. Analysis: Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent Britain's nuclear deterrent doesn't come cheap. It'll cost around £20bn to replace the current fleet of four Trident submarines, sometime during the next decade. Not everyone's convinced - either in Parliament or the MOD - that the UK can afford or really needs a like for like replacement. This study, by the distinguished defence think tank Rusi, highlights the additional costs if Scotland votes for independence. It concludes that moving the deterrent from the Clyde and the secure storage facilities for the warheads at Coulport is financially and technically feasible but wouldn't be cheap - between an additional £2.5bn to £3.5bn. It'll also cost a lot of political capital - persuading people of Plymouth and Falmouth that it's in their interests to have the deterrent and warheads based in their backyard instead. The Ministry of Defence has already had to cut its cloth to the tougher economic climate. It would rather not contemplate an even bigger dent to its finances as a result of a "Yes" vote. Mr Chalmers said: "When people start considering options for relocations it's only natural to assume that it would be quite expensive and very difficult and that is certainly the case. But importantly it is not impossible. "We estimate that essentially the net costs of relocating could actually be £2.5-3.5bn at 2012 prices, rather than the tens of billions or even £20bn that has been put forward so far." But he said it would take a long time, and was unlikely to be completed by the SNP's target date of 2020. Mr Chalmers said: "It may be possible to deactivate Trident by that point and have it out of Scotland but it's unlikely we would have been able to have it up and running in a new location by that point. "The Scottish government has acknowledged that if they were to become independent there would be a period of time where the UK would be basing its nuclear forces in an independent country. The UK would be the first country to ever do this." A more "natural timeframe" would be linked to the entry of a new generation of nuclear-armed submarines, currently anticipated to start in 2028, he argued. Mr Chalmers said the Rusi paper showed the possibility of a "space for a friendly and amicable settlement" over Trident in the event of independence. He added: "Effectively this is a key aspect of any negotiations that will emerge after a Yes vote. "This will be a very, very important issue. If both Scotland and the UK can show that they can come to some sort of amicable arrangement then that untangles a very knotty issue. "We are trying to essentially dispel the myth that relocating Trident out of Scotland is impossible and in doing so create some space allowing an amicable settlement to be reached in the event of a Yes vote." 'Speedy withdrawal' A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said: "As Rusi's paper shows, the UK government has choices on what it decides to do with its nuclear weapons following their removal from an independent Scotland, including of course the potential to reconsider the possession and planned renewal of Trident. "The Scottish government will work responsibly with the government in Westminster in securing the speediest safe withdrawal of Trident from an independent Scotland. "We look forward to the opportunity to discuss these arrangements with the UK government following a vote for independence." A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: "There are no plans to move Trident from Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde and unilateral disarmament is not an option. "We are not planning for Scottish independence and as such it is difficult to estimate the total costs, or how long it would take, to replicate the facilities at Faslane, but it would likely cost taxpayers billions of pounds and take many years."
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 1.6% in September from a year ago - the lowest since January 2010. That also missed market expectations of a 1.7% yearly rise, and was down from 2% in August. The slowing inflation rate could be a result of good harvest weather in China, said Tim Condon at ING. "Typically the months we need to worry about for food in China are in the middle of the year and the beginning January/February which are Lunar New Year contagion months, so we're in the soft period now for food component inflation," he said. Will Beijing step in? Economists said the recent figures give policymakers a lot of room to stimulate the economy with inflation well below Beijing's official annual target of 3.5%, but most are divided on whether authorities will step in. "Everything I'm hearing from the authorities is they feel the economy is broadly in a good shape and not needing broad assistance that would come from a deposit rate cut or an RRR [reserve requirement ratio] cut," Mr Condon said. Trade figures on Monday did show that China's exports and imports in September were far higher than expected, giving a surplus of $31bn (£20bn). But economist Li Huiyong at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities said the unexpected inflation figures show a weak domestic economy. "We expect policymakers will take more measures to stabilise the economy. The possibility of an interest rate cut is increasing in the coming months."
Judge Peter Murphy made the ruling at Blackfriars Crown Court in London where the woman is due to stand trial accused of intimidating a witness. The 22-year-old woman, from Hackney, has refused to remove her niqab and reveal her face in front of any man. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded not guilty at an earlier hearing. The judge's ruling means that if the woman, who started wearing a veil in May 2012, refuses to comply during her trial she could be jailed for contempt of court. The only part of a niqab-wearer's face that is visible is a narrow section across the eyes. The judge said he would offer the woman a screen to shield her from public view while giving evidence but that she had to be seen by him, the jury and lawyers. At other times during the trial the woman will be allowed to keep her face covered while sitting in the dock. 'Elephant in courtroom' In the ruling Judge Murphy said: "The ability of the jury to see the defendant for the purposes of evaluating her evidence is crucial." Referring to the woman as "D", he said he had "no reason to doubt the sincerity of her belief" and his decision would have been the same if she had worn the niqab for years. He said that "the niqab has become the elephant in the courtroom" and there was widespread anxiety among judges over how to tackle the issue. He added he hoped "Parliament or a higher court will provide a definite answer to the issue soon". Judge Murphy said: "If judges in different cases in different places took differing approaches [to the niqab] the result would be judicial anarchy." The woman's defence barrister Susan Meek had argued the woman's human right to express her faith through her attire would be breached if she was ordered to remove her veil. When asked if there would be an appeal against the decision, the woman's lawyer said she and her client would "consider our options". At a previous hearing, the issue of her identity was resolved when the woman removed her veil in private for a female police officer. Judge Murphy's ruling comes as Liberal Democrat Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said he was "uneasy" about restricting freedoms and called for a national debate on the state's role in stopping veils being imposed on girls. Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society, said he believed it was "vital" defendants' faces were visible at "all times" and said he "regretted" the judge's decision. He added: "We will be complaining to the Office of Judicial Complaints and also be asking senior legal officers to make visibility throughout court hearings mandatory, and not subject to judges' discretion." The woman's trial over alleged witness intimidation is due to begin at Blackfriars Crown Court on 4 November.
BBC TrendingWhat's popular and why Each year during summer solstice, it's thought that 10,000 dogs are cooked and eaten in Yulin, in Guangxi province in southern China, as part of the city's yearly dog meat festival. Although it's not illegal to eat dog meat in China, opinion is divided on how deep the "tradition" really runs. On Chinese social media in recent years, the Yulin Festival has become a focus for the large numbers of animal lovers - mostly within China - who are against it. But this year, the reaction has gone global. Since May, almost a quarter of a million tweets have been posted using the hashtag #StopYulin2015, with most of the activity coming from the UK, the US and Australia. One of the loudest voices has been the US animal welfare group Duo Duo, whose change.org petition calling for the cancellation of the event has received more than 200,000 signatures. The group's campaign video on YouTube has been viewed more than 130,000 times. "I went to a slaughter house in Yulin a few days ago. The dogs and cats were wearing collars and of different sizes and breeds. They were very friendly," says Duo Duo founder Andrea Gung. "Dogs are man's best friend. To kill more than 10,000 of them in one day is wrong," she says. Activists have also raised health concerns - although the meat is traditionally seen as having health benefits, campaigners claim the dogs transported into Yulin come from the black market and could be diseased. "The consumer thinks they're safe to eat but they're not," says Gung. Duo Duo has intentionally targeted a Western audience with its social media campaign, rather than campaigning within China, as it says it doesn't want to interfere with the activities of local activists. "The main thing we have done is made people in Yulin realise that their tradition is something from the past, that is perceived negatively from the outside world," says Gung. The conversation about Yulin has been mostly negative on western social media, but the chatter has been more mixed on the Chinese network Weibo. A page dedicated to discussing "Yulin Dog Day" has generated almost 350,000 comments. Many Weibo users expressed concern at the idea of eating dogs and shared loving images of their pets. But others accused animal welfare activists of hypocrisy and said local values in Guangxi Province should be respected. So just how widespread is the eating of dog meat in China? "Although meat eating has increased in China over the past 30 years as the country becomes more affluent, dog meat is really not widely available," says Sam Geall, executive editor of the China Dialogue environmental blog. "In the 15 years that I have been travelling to China I have never once been offered dog meat." Some have even claimed that the Yulin Dog Festival and similar events are in fact designed to draw in international tourists. "It's common that local tourist administrators will capitalise on elements of their past to attract revenue and tourism," Geall says. But with increasing numbers of middle-class Chinese owning pets, criticism of the practice within China is growing fast. "The perception of dog-meat eating has changed because of social media," says Geall. "Over the past five years there has been a growth in the number of domestic animal welfare groups using Chinese social media to campaign against the consumption of dog meat."

By Celia HattonBBC News, Beijing Top politicians from other countries often engage in charitable or diplomatic work when they retire. But in China, there's an unspoken rule that Chinese leaders should step out of the public spotlight when they step down from office. The very concept of retirement is relatively new in the world of Communist politics. For decades, cadres were expected to follow an old party slogan by "working for the revolution with their last breath and last drop of blood". In 2002, then-President Jiang Zemin tried to clear the ranks at the top of the party by instituting retirement age limits: 68 for top leaders and 65 for senior level officials. That rule has been followed with varying degrees of success. Mr Jiang himself delayed his own retirement. He stayed on as the chairman of China's military for two years until 2004 after relinquishing his other positions to his successor, Hu Jintao. Just this week, the governor of China's Central Bank, Zhou Xiaochuan was allowed to remain in his role past the age of 65. It's thought that Chinese leaders wanted Mr Zhou to continue his successful economic reforms, so they bent the rules to allow him to stay. 'Meddling' The decision was unpopular with users of weibo, China's version of Twitter. "Zhou is not a saviour, and he's not God!" one typical poster complained. "New talents emerge in every generation, and it's the rule of nature to replace the old with the new." Many Chinese citizens have also been clear in their demand for former Communist cadres to stop meddling in current affairs. "The last thing we want is to see retired leaders using their political power to serve their private needs behind the scenes, intervening with reform and social progress," says Wu Zuolai, a popular blogger and scholar at the Chinese National Academy of the Arts. Those demanding a clear line between current and former leaders focus most of their anger on - who else? - former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin. According to China's state-run media, Mr Jiang vowed to do nothing but work as a university lecturer after retirement. Instead, he became famous for his active role in back-room party politics. Last year was a particularly busy one for Mr Jiang, 86, as he pushed to secure plum appointments for his protégés ahead of last November's Communist Party leadership transition. Mr Jiang's office inside Zhongnanhai, the central Beijing compound where the country's elite politicians live and work, was only closed late last year, after China's new Communist Party leader Xi Jinping had come into power. Some believe retired leaders have no choice but to stay involved in politics because they must ensure the party will not prosecute them for past misdeeds. However, there is little chance this would actually happen, says Steve Tsang, professor at the School of Contemporary Chinese Studies at the University of Nottingham. If possible, the Communist Party would avoid opening a Pandora's Box of unnecessary strife by attacking a politician who is no longer in power. 'Controlling history' Some ageing leaders might yearn to retire in peace, but they are pushed to stay involved in political affairs by those who benefit from their influence. Even if Hu Jintao wanted to enjoy a life of peaceful seclusion in retirement, Steve Tsang explains, the officials who followed him up the ranks of China's Communist Youth League will push him to stay involved ahead of the next party power transition in 2017. "Those people will have a vested interest to make sure Hu Jintao is not completely out and won't fade into retirement fully," Dr Tsang says. "They want to be sure that the Youth League remains a fully coherent power block." Behind the scenes, retired leaders are busy but one rule is clear: they are expected to stay away from the country's history books. Some politicians might be tempted to write memoirs of their time in office, but the Communist Party will discourage their personal accounts from entering the public record. "You're not going to get it published unless it has received official permission for publication, which means it will be very, very heavily vetted," says Dr Tsang. Even the most senior former leaders cannot escape China's censors. Li Peng, who acted as China's premier from 1987 to 1998, is thought to have written a relatively conservative explanation of his involvement in 1989's Tiananmen Square crackdown. However, it was banned from publication. Another former premier, Zhao Ziyang, was forced to smuggle his account of the Tiananmen events to a publishing house in Hong Kong. "History is far too important a matter to be left to former presidents or former premiers," Mr Tsang explains. "History is something which the party must maintain very careful control over. After all, the party has a monopoly on the truth. Controlling history is a way of monopolising the truth." As former leaders feel their way through the gilded cage of retirement, they can gather strength in the knowledge that soon, their ranks will swell. Five of the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the elite group which steers the Communist Party, are set to step down in 2017. Perhaps, by that point, Zhou Xiaochuan, the industrious bank governor, will be ready to greet them.
The FSB says they are members of ultra-nationalist movements and were preparing attacks inside Russia. Ukraine's Security Service says Russian media reports that it had ordered any such attacks were "nonsense". Tensions are high after Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula. Nato says Russia has tens of thousands of troops massed along its border with eastern Ukraine. The BBC's Steven Rosenberg in Moscow says those detained by the FSB reportedly include three members of the Ukrainian nationalist group Right Sector. The Ukrainians have been accused of taking photographs of Russian troop movements and of trying to make contact with extremist elements in Russia. In a statement, the FSB said those being held had been planning attacks between 14-17 March in Russia's Rostov, Volgograd, Tver, Orel, Belgorod, Kalmykia and Tatarstan regions. Earlier, government officials in Kiev levelled their own accusations against Moscow, claiming that more than 30 FSB agents had been involved in planning operations against anti-government protesters in Kiev earlier this year. Ukrainian Security Service chief Valentyn Nalyvaychenko also said the FSB had sent "tonnes" of explosives and weapons by plane to Ukraine. More than 100 protesters were killed in unrest that started last November when then President Viktor Yanukovych abandoned an association deal with the EU in favour of closer ties with Russia. Months of street protests ended when Mr Yanukovych fled Kiev in February and opposition leaders formed an interim government. Ukraine's new authorities have since signed the political part of the association agreement with the EU. Also on Thursday, Ukraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said an inquiry had shown that special police had been behind the killings of anti-government protesters in Kiev in February. He said 12 members of the Berkut police had been identified as snipers and arrested. He presented what he said was new evidence from the shootings on 18-20 February, when 76 people were killed. 'Same gun' Mr Avakov said the inquiry had established that in one episode, eight of those killed were hit by bullets from the same gun. Most of the demonstrators who died were killed on Instytutska Street near the main protest camp on Independence Square, widely known as the Maidan. Shortly after Mr Yanukovych's downfall, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula following a referendum that Kiev and the West have called illegal. Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told the BBC that it was "crystal clear" that President Yanukovych and his allies were responsible for the killings of protesters - a claim denied by Mr Yanukovych who is now in Russia. In other developments on Thursday, Moscow raised the price of its gas for Ukraine to $485 (£292) per 1,000 cubic metres - the second hike in two days. The European Parliament also backed a proposal to cut customs duties on imports from Ukraine - a measure that is expected to save Ukrainian firms 487m euros (£404m) per year.
Here he is in his own words: On himself "I am very much down to Earth. Just not this earth." On his early childhood "When I was four I asked my mother for a valet for my birthday." On his creative work "I have a sort of Alzheimer's for my own work, which I think is a very good thing. Today too many people remember what they did - just forget it all and start again." On the fashion business "We created a product nobody needs, but people want. If you need an ugly old car, it can wait, but if you want a new fashion item, it cannot wait." On vanity "Vanity is the healthiest thing in life." On his public persona "I am like a caricature of myself, and I like that. It is like a mask. And for me the Carnival of Venice lasts all year long." On self-care "Don't sacrifice yourself too much, because if you sacrifice too much there's nothing else you can give and nobody will care for you." On fashion's role "Whatever it is, good or bad, it influences fashion. You can see that in fashion quicker than in any other thing going on. Fashion is something that reflects our lives and times with the shortest release because, cars, design and architecture take years to realise." On retirement "Why should I stop working? If I do, I'll die and it'll be all finished." On memoirs "I have nothing to say. I'm actually trying to make sure that I won't be remembered."
The man, named as US diplomat Ryan Fogle, was held overnight before being released to US officials, Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) said. Russia has declared him "persona non grata" and ordered his expulsion, the foreign ministry said on its website. The US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, had been summoned, it added. Mr Fogle is said to have worked as third political secretary at the US embassy in Moscow, which has issued no comment on the matter so far. Photos have emerged of his alleged detention. The agent was reportedly arrested with a large sum of money, technical devices and written instructions for the agent he had tried to recruit. While it is a sensitive time for US-Russian relations because of the crisis in Syria, the FSB's claims to have unearthed a CIA agent are unlikely to have any long-term political consequences, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg reports from Moscow. Both countries recently said they wished to step up security co-operation after the Boston Marathon bombing. 'Dear friend' FSB photos purporting to show Mr Fogle during and after his detention appeared on Russian online media, such as these published by broadcaster RT. Wearing a blue checked shirt and a plain baseball cap, he is shown being held on the ground with his hands bound, then being escorted away. Another photo shows him sitting at desk, his hat removed. Possessions said to be Mr Fogle's are laid out on a table. They include a sum of money in 500-euro banknotes and two wigs, one of which he was apparently wearing at the time of his detention. Also on the table are a compass, map, knife, dark glasses and small mobile phone. "FSB counter-intelligence agents detained a CIA staff member who had been working under the cover of third political secretary of the US embassy in Moscow," the FSB said. "At the moment of detention, special technical equipment was discovered, written instructions for the Russian citizen being recruited, as well as a large sum of money and means for altering appearance." Russian state TV has displayed a piece of paper, which it said was Mr Fogle's letter to the Russian officer. Addressing the recipient as "Dear friend", the letter offers $100,000 (£65,400) "to discuss your experience, expertise and co-operation". It goes on to say: "We can offer up to $1m a year for long-term co-operation, with extra bonuses if we receive some helpful information. "This is a down-payment from someone who is very impressed with your professionalism and who would greatly appreciate your co-operation in the future." The letter is simply signed "Your friends".
The seven are among 14 indicted on corruption charges in a US inquiry, the US Department of Justice said. The second criminal case was launched by Swiss prosecutors into the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, to be held in Russia and Qatar respectively. But Fifa says it plans to go ahead with an election for president as planned. Incumbent president Sepp Blatter, who is seeking a fifth term, was not one of the seven officials arrested. Fifa also said there would be no rerun of the World Cup bidding processes for 2018 and 2022. Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein of Jordan - Mr Blatter's rival for the Fifa presidency - said "we cannot continue with the crisis in Fifa". "Fifa needs leadership that governs, guides and protects our national associations." Fifa's Zurich headquarters has also been raided, with electronic data and documents seized. US authorities also searched the headquarters of Concacaf - the Fifa confederation for North and Central America and the Caribbean - in Miami, Florida, as part of their investigations. 'Rampant, systemic, deep-rooted' The US justice department said 14 individuals were under investigation worldwide for allegedly accepting bribes and kickbacks estimated at more than $150m (£97m) over a 24-year period. The seven arrested at a five-star hotel in Zurich on Wednesday were: Also indicted are former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner, Nicolas Leoz, Aaron Davidson, Alejandro Burzaco, Jose Margulies, and Hugo and Mariano Jinkis. "The indictment alleges corruption that is rampant, systemic, and deep-rooted both abroad and here in the United States," said US Attorney General Loretta Lynch. "Today's announcement should send a message that enough is enough," Acting US Attorney Kelly Currie said. Several officials have already pleaded guilty, the US Department of Justice says. These include Charles "Chuck" Blazer, the former head of Concacaf, who was previously on the Fifa executive committee. Mr Blazer, one of Fifa's most senior US representatives, allegedly started working with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and took part in undercover work, according to US media reports. Mr Warner reacted to the news by saying he had not been questioned and was innocent of any charges. He said that since leaving Fifa four years ago "I have recommitted my life to the work of improving the lot of every citizen of every creed and race in this nation (Trinidad and Tobago)... I have fought fearlessly against all forms of injustice and corruption." He added: "The actions of Fifa no longer concern me." Football's untouchable 'dark prince' - Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Switzerland Many have wondered how Sepp Blatter can have been in charge of Fifa for so long amid so many reports of corruption and yet remain, apparently, untouched. One Swiss newspaper jokingly called him "the dark prince of football, the godfather, Don Blatterone" - but no inquiry has ever revealed proof of his involvement in corruption. "He's a survivor," says one member of parliament, Roland Buechel. "Nothing ever sticks to him; there is always someone between him and the bribes." Some old friends describe Mr Blatter as down-to-earth and open. Others who have worked with him say he is a man who resents opposition, pointing to the swift departure of Fifa colleagues who dared to question him. What emerges, finally, is a man who both critics and supporters say cannot imagine his life without Fifa, a man whose tenure as president has outlasted three marriages. But as scandal follows scandal, Mr Blatter's determination not to leave his post willingly could see him bundled unceremoniously out of the back door. Sepp Blatter: The man who won't give up 'Right track' Fifa "welcomes the process and co-operates fully with the attorney general of Switzerland," spokesman Walter DeGregorio told reporters on Wednesday. "It is certainly a difficult moment for us," he said, "but this is good for Fifa. It confirms that we are on the right track". Both Swiss and US justice officials said the indicted officials had allegedly received $150m worth of bribes from the early 1990s for football tournaments in the US and Latin America. The alleged crimes were agreed to and prepared in the US via US bank accounts, the office of the Swiss prosecutor said, adding that the Swiss authorities could immediately approve the extradition. In the second case, Swiss prosecutors opened criminal proceedings "against persons unknown on suspicion of criminal mismanagement and of money laundering in connection with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 football World Cups". Swiss police said they would question 10 Fifa executive committee members who participated in the votes that selected Russia and Qatar in December 2010. Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the investigation would not affect its hosting of the 2018 event, telling Associated Press: "We've got nothing to hide."
The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said that interest rates are unlikely to be raised before the rate falls to 7%. The number of people unemployed fell 24,000 in the period to 2.487 million. The official figures also showed the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance fell 32,600 to 1.402 million, its lowest level since February 2009. However, the number of people working part-time because they cannot find a full-time job rose to 1.45 million, the highest since records began in 1992 and double the number of five years ago. Almost a third of men working part-time were doing so because they could not find full-time employment. The corresponding figure for women was 13.5%. 'Recovering market' "It's another set of impressive figures on the job market with positive signs on all three main indicators," said Victoria Clarke at Investec. "It suggests the jobs market is recovering, much like the broader economy." "It reinforces our view that unemployment will come down to 7% more quickly than the Bank of England expects." Mr Carney said he expected the fall to 7% to take at least three years. The pound rose against both the euro and the US dollar following the release of the figures. The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance in July was revised downwards. The fall of 68,900 in July and August was the biggest two-month drop since June 1997. August's fall in the claimant count was the tenth consecutive month that the figure had dropped. 'Total complacency' The North East of England had the highest rate of unemployment between May and July, with 10.4%, while the South East had the lowest at 5.8%. The biggest increase during that period was in the North West of England, where unemployment rose by 13,000. The South East showed the biggest fall, with 29,000 fewer people unemployed than there were in the previous three months, followed by the East Midlands, with a fall of 11,000. Labour leader Ed Miliband stressed the uneven picture around the country in exchanges during Prime Minister's Questions. "The chancellor went out and said he had saved the economy," he said. Mr Miliband described that as "total complacency and total hubris... at a time when, even today, unemployment is rising in half the country". The Prime Minister, David Cameron, attacked Labour's policies. "They told us that unemployment would go up and not down. They told us that the growth of private sector jobs would never make up for the loss of [public] sector jobs," he said. "They have been wrong on every single one of those issues." 'Resilience and flexibility' Average pay rose by 1.1% including bonuses compared with the same time last year, or 1.0% excluding them, which is well below the 2.8% rate at which prices are rising. Between March and June 2013, public sector employment fell 34,000, while private sector employment rose 114,000. "The positive figures are a measure of the resilience and the flexibility of Britain's labour market," said David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce. "The further increase in private sector employment, at a time when the public sector is still shedding jobs, demonstrates yet again that private firms are able to drive the recovery." The figures for unemployment in the three months to July are based on the Labour Force Survey, in which the ONS speaks to 60,000 households once a quarter, making it the country's biggest household survey. The ONS is 95% confident that the main unemployment figure is correct to plus or minus 85,000 people.
Shaimaa Ahmed, a 25-year-old known professionally as Shyma, was arrested last month after the video sparked outrage in the conservative country. On Tuesday, she was found guilty of inciting debauchery and publishing an indecent film, local media said. The video's director was also sentenced to two years in prison in absentia. Shyma had apologised before her arrest to people who took the video for the song, I Have Issues, "in an inappropriate way". "I didn't imagine all this would happen and that I would be subjected to such a strong attack from everyone," she wrote on her now-deleted Facebook page. Last year, Egyptian courts sentenced three female dancers to six months each in prison after convicting them of inciting debauchery in music videos. Another singer is meanwhile facing trial for "spreading provocative publicity" because she suggested that drinking from the River Nile could make someone ill. A lawsuit was filed last month after video emerged showing Sherine Abdel Wahab being asked at a concert last year to sing Mashrebtesh Men Nilha (Have You Drunk From The Nile?). She responded by saying "drinking from the Nile will get me schistosomiasis" - a disease caused by a parasitic worm that is commonly known as bilharzia. On Monday, the Egyptian Musicians Syndicate announced that it had decided to ban Abdel Wahab from performing concerts in the country for two months.
The nuclear-powered carrier set anchor off the port city of Danang, where US combat troops first landed in the war, making this a highly symbolic location. The visit is meant to demonstrate the countries' growing military ties. But analysts say it inevitably sends a message to China as it continues to develop the disputed South China Sea. It comes as China announced a military budget of 1.11 trillion yuan, an 8% increase on last year, as its annual meeting of parliament got under way in Beijing. The BBC's Jonathan Head, who is in Danang, says that while co-operation between the US and Vietnam's military has grown it is still limited, and Vietnam has to manage the messaging of this visit carefully. China is now the de facto superpower in this region, and by far the most important trading partner for Vietnam. So Vietnam's communist leadership is taking care to avoid any steps that might upset relations with its giant neighbour, our correspondent says. Analysis: The US woos an old enemy as China waits in the wings China claims almost all of the South China Sea, including reefs and islands also claimed by other nations. Vietnam specifically exercises claims over the Paracel and Spratly islands. The US has always said it does not take sides in the South China Sea dispute, but the US Navy has consistently run so-called "freedom of navigation" operations through disputed waters, a clear challenge to China's territorial ambitions. The USS Carl Vinson has made many journeys to the wider region in its decades of service and was last in the sea just days ago. Danang was a major US military base during the Vietnam War. The docking of the vast vessel, which can support up to 90 aircraft, will represent the largest US military presence in Vietnam since the end of many years of bitter conflict and after the country was unified in 1975. The Vietnam War - which Vietnam calls the American War - was protracted and bloody. The Vietnamese government estimates that millions of Vietnamese, both civilian and Communist fighters, were killed. Just over 58,000 American soldiers were killed or went missing in action. Only a symbolic message: Jonathan Head, BBC News, Danang The presence of a US aircraft carrier in Danang, one which will be conducting so-called "freedom of navigation" passages through the disputed areas of the South China Sea, also sends a potentially provocative message to China - but only a symbolic one. To date US expressions of concern over China's actions in the sea have had no discernable impact on the construction of military facilities there. The US carrier strike group looks impressive, but it is not clear what it can actually do to restrain China. Even as Vietnam's top brass enjoy watching the full might of the superpower they once fought now paying court as a would-be ally, they must remain mindful of the continuing historic shift in the balance of power in their region away from the United States, in favour of China.

By Paul AdamsBBC News The number of people attempting the dangerous sea crossing from North Africa to Italy has risen sharply, says Frontex, the EU border agency. From January to April, 42,000 migrants were detected on these routes, with 25,650 of these crossing from Libya. Combined with seven other less busy routes, the total figure for this year is probably now about 60,000. On Wednesday, the Italian government said the number of refugees and other migrants reaching its shores had soared to more than 39,000. The total for 2014 so far is more than the equivalent period in 2011, the year of the Arab Spring, which eventually saw 140,000 make clandestine crossings into Europe. "If the current trends continue, and with the summer months approaching, there is a strong likelihood the numbers will increase further," says Gil Arias Fernandez, Frontex's Deputy Executive Director. At least a third of the latest arrivals are Syrians, fleeing that country's civil war. But other significant numbers are coming from Afghanistan and Eritrea. In Calais, where the French authorities this week demolished two main squatter camps, the BBC found migrants from a host of countries, from West Africa to Bangladesh, with large groups from Iran and Pakistan's restive tribal areas. Tracking one of the biggest migrations since World War Two Almost three million people have fled Syria's bloody civil war. UN figures show the human tide began in earnest in early 2012. Experts say the latest numbers are not surprising, after relatively low levels of migration in the early months of 2013. "The main route through Libya was closed for so long that people in sub-Saharan countries have been waiting for a couple of years," says Franck Duvell, associate professor at the Centre on Migration, Policy, and Society at the University of Oxford. "So the numbers have been building up and people were waiting for the very first opportunity to move," he says. "I'm not sure this implies that we are going to see ever-more people arriving in the EU over the next couple of months. We've got to wait and see." Much depends on the chaotic political and security situation in Libya, where a BBC team has recently seen evidence that large numbers of migrants are still waiting to cross. Some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000. Italy complains that since last October, when it launched its "Mare Nostrum" [Our Sea] rescue operation, the cost of patrolling its patch of the Mediterranean has risen to 300,000 euros (£240,200: $408,000) a day.
The EU was an anachronism which "costs us a huge amount of money and subverts our democracy", the Tory MP said. He insisted there were no downsides to leaving, suggesting the UK could ape Canada's trade arrangement with the EU. But David Cameron said it was wrong to say the UK could do a "sweetheart deal" with the EU after walking out. And in his first major intervention in the referendum debate, former prime minister Tony Blair said he was concerned by the "fervour" of those wanting to leave the EU but he believed that the UK would ultimately vote to remain on 23 June as it was in the national interest. Mr Johnson, one of a number of senior Conservatives to break ranks with the PM and back EU exit, told activists in Kent that the UK was the most creative country in Europe and was "big enough and strong enough to stand on its own". 'Mad and idealistic' If people were faced with the choice of whether to join the EU in 2016, he said they would probably regard the organisation as "a bit mad and idealistic", with huge "costs and bureaucracy" which restricted nation states' ability to make their own laws and control their borders. "Would anyone in their right mind want to join the EU today?" he said. "It is 50 years old, it is going in the wrong direction. It is time for real reform. The only way to get that is to leave." Mr Johnson said the UK could forge a new free trade deal with the EU, based on Canada's existing arrangement, and dismissed suggestions by Prime Minister David Cameron that he and other Leave campaigners were willing to sacrifice jobs and growth to achieve a measure of greater independence. "You look at the plan to increase the efforts to prop up the single currency with an ever denser system of integration, with more and more regulation about all sorts of social and economic issues which will impact directly on this country, I think the risk is increasingly in staying in the project. "I think the best thing we can do is show a lead, show an example and strike out for freedom." Taking a swipe at the campaign to stay in the EU, which opponents have dubbed "Project Fear", Mr Johnson quoted US President Franklin Roosevelt, saying "the only thing we have to fear is fear itself", adding "even fear is not that scary". 'Tomfoolery' Canada has been cited by a number of Leave campaigners as a model for how the UK can continue to do business with the EU without being bound by rules on freedom of movement or having to contribute to its budget. It signed a free trade agreement with the EU in 2014, seven years after talk about closer economic co-operation was first mooted. The agreement, which eliminates 98% of tariffs between the two blocs, has yet to be ratified by either side but is expected to enter into force next year. Addressing activists in Wales, Mr Cameron said having to negotiate new trading rules from scratch would lead to a long period of unacceptable uncertainty for British business. "Seven years of not knowing what the arrangements would be for trading with Europe," he said. "Seven years of uncertainty for businesses wanting to invest in Britain not knowing what our relationship with Britain would be. "They cannot be justified. They cannot be in our national interest. We should reject that out of hand." Analysis By BBC Political Correspondent Iain Watson One of the key lines of attack from those who want to remain in the EU is what would "out" look like? Those who want to leave are taunted that they have no clear idea of what kind of trade deal could be struck with Brussels if we withdraw. But today Boris Johnson provided the clarity that had been requested - look across the Atlantic to Canada, he said. So now expect the focus of the Remain attack to change. Far from being grateful for the London Mayor's clarification, the terms of that deal will be denounced. Already pro-EU campaigners are pointing out just how long it took for a Canadian agreement to be struck - and are questioning if it'd be appropriate for the UK, which is far more reliant on financial services. As Boris Johnson will find out, throwing aside his comfort blanket of bluster and giving clear answers to questions in this complex EU debate comes with consequences. Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who is campaigning to Remain in the EU, said the Canadian model excluded the services industry - which accounts for a huge proportion of British employment - and accused Mr Johnson of "playing fast and loose" with jobs linked to EU membership. "I am fed up with this entertainment, tomfoolery and the rest from Boris Johnson. This will affect my constituents," he told BBC News. And Mr Blair told Radio 4's Today that the UK's destiny was to "lead in Europe", warning Brexit would lead to economic instability and "damage fundamentally" the interests of the British people. "I would like to see the pro-European side get out there with a bit of passion and vigour and determination and stand up for what we believe. But in a further boost for the Leave campaign, the head of the Conservative group of MEPs in the European Parliament, Syed Kamall, has said he believes the UK "could forge a better life outside" the EU. Mr Kamall, who also heads the pan-European ECR group, said he believed a "fair and balanced" immigration policy was only possible outside the EU.
Nick RobinsonPolitical editor Few can doubt it now. It is over 100 years since a national election has been won by a party other than the Conservatives and Labour. What's more the UK Independence Party did it by winning seats not just in every region of England but in Wales and Scotland too. The impact of the result will be immediate. David Cameron will face pressure to harden up his promise to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU and to reduce immigration to win back the many Tory voters lost to UKIP. Ed Miliband will face an inquest into why before the votes of Londoners were counted Labour were only neck and neck with the Tories. And Nick Clegg will face demands to explain what can save his party if it is not a change of leadership. Alex Salmond will have to confront the fact that he failed in his aim of ensuring that Scotland was a UKIP-free zone. However, he'll use the result to urge Scots to break free from the anti European forces which topped the poll in England. Only Nigel Farage can be totally satisfied today although he knows all too well that winning a national election which he described as a "free hit" on the political establishment is much easier than winning a single seat in Westminster. A year ago few took that prospect seriously. They do now.
The men, women and children were discovered in a refrigerated trailer in Grays on 23 October. The four defendants were found guilty of "organising, brokering illegal emigration" after a one-day trial in Ha Tinh, VnExpress reported. The state media outlet said one victim paid $22,000 for the illegal journey. The four defendants, aged between 24 and 36, were given sentences ranging from two-and-a-half to seven-and-a-half years. Three others received suspended jail sentences. 'Asphyxia and hyperthermia' The bodies of the Vietnamese nationals were discovered at an industrial estate soon after the lorry arrived in the UK on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Ten teenagers, two of them 15-year-old boys, were among the dead. An inquest heard their medical cause of death was asphyxia and hyperthermia. Last month haulier Ronan Hughes, 40, of Tyholland, County Monaghan, admitted manslaughter and conspiring to assist unlawful immigration at the Old Bailey while Eamonn Harrison, 23, of Mayobridge, County Down, denied 39 charges of manslaughter. Gazmir Nuzi, 42, of Barclay Road, Tottenham, north London, pleaded guilty to a single charge of assisting unlawful immigration on or before 11 October 2019 and 18 April 2020. Earlier this year, lorry driver Maurice Robinson, 25, of Craigavon, County Armagh, pleaded guilty to 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. Mr Harrison now faces a trial expected to last five weeks starting on 5 October with three others. Gheorghe Nica, 43, of Langdon Hills, Basildon, Essex, denies 39 counts of manslaughter and conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration. Valentin Calota, 37, of Birmingham, and Christopher Kennedy, 23, of County Armagh, Northern Ireland, have each denied conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration.
By Matthew Price and Seren JonesBBC Beyond Today podcast Even now, a year after one of the most complex and dangerous rescues the world has ever seen, Vernon is still dealing with the trauma of those 17 desperate days. The memory of the moment he heard 12 boys and their football coach had been found alive deep underground is almost too much. The relief - and the horror of what lay ahead - come flooding back. "The real problems started from then," he told the BBC Beyond Today podcast. "We knew where they were. It's a kilometre and a half of diving. How the hell were we going to get them out alive?" Vernon is a calm, measured man who deals well with pressure. He's been exploring underground caves for almost 50 years – a hobby that started in his native Lancashire when he was 16. "The bug is finding a passage nobody's ever been into before - you know you're the first. Whatever footprints you leave, they're yours." It's a hobby - not his job. But it's a pastime that made him one of just a handful of people in the world who could even attempt the impossible: saving the Wild Boars football team. Trapped by a rising flood The Wild Boars were a group of 12 boys aged 11 to 16. On Saturday 23 June 2018, after their football training, they decided to head to the Tham Luang caves for a day trip, along with their 25-year-old coach. It's a well-known local landmark and it wasn't unusual to go in at that time of year. Many like to see how far they can get into a system that runs for 10km (six miles). Some of the boys had been before. This time, they decided they would all go in together. But the team got trapped by floodwater 4km (2.5 miles) inside – and that's when Thai officials called Vernon's phone, asking him to help out. "I know it [the cave system] better than anybody. It's been my second home. I don't have to think about where I am," he says. He drove to Tham Luang to meet officials and the local rescue team, but was stunned with what he found. "[It was] organised chaos," he said. "They didn't really know what to do, simply because they'd never had this situation arise before – especially involving 13 people trapped by rising floodwaters. But I knew because of the weather conditions that it was only going to get worse. "I knew that this was going to end with someone losing their life." Vernon took matters into his own hands. He wrote a list of the team he believed he needed for the rescue. It included Rob Harper, Rick Stanton, and John Volanthen - who were all in the UK. In an attempt to get the Britons involved, Vernon spoke to the former governor of the local province, Chiang Rai, a man named Narongsak Osatanakorn. "I got him into a room and I basically said to him: Sir, you have one chance at this rescue." To put the pressure on, Vernon met other government officials too. That evening Rob, Rick and John were on a plane to Thailand. 'They thought they were finding bodies' It was straight to work for the British divers. On 28 June, in appalling weather conditions, John Volanthen and Rick Stanton went to the cave for an exploratory dive. To their disbelief, they found four Thai water management officials who had been trapped in there overnight. "Officials tried to basically ignore it ever happened because they didn't know the guys were in there. There was no logging of people going in. Nobody reported them as being lost or not around, not even their wives." Governor Narongsak disputes this - he says he and other officials did know the four water officials were in the cave, and they had been told not to evacuate. But the unexpected rescue was a blessing in disguise. John and Rick had to dive the four officials out of the flooded caves. One of them had panicked during the rescue – and now Vernon and the team knew it would be impossible - if they were to find the boys - to dive them out of the cave without sedation. The search for the team started on 1 July, but it wasn't until the following day that they were discovered. Rick and John led the way. "There was a horrible smell," Vernon remembers Rick telling him. "Rick thought it was dead bodies. It was faeces. They thought they were finding bodies." They'd found the team - but now they had to get them out. 'What if I decide not to do it?' To the divers' knowledge, there are only three people in the world who are both elite cave divers and anaesthetists – one in the UK, one in the US, and one in Australia. The British team got in touch with the Australian, Richard "Harry" Harris. "Doc Harry said: 'It won't work'. He said 'it just won't work'," Vernon recalls. "Rick said to Harry: 'Well I'd like you to sleep on it overnight', and Harry said to Rick: 'What if I decide not to do it?'" "And Rick said: 'They all die'." Richard Harris was almost on board. First, though, he made sure that the Australian government negotiated with the Thai government to give him immunity in case anything went wrong. For the others, British embassy officials were brought to Tham Luang to make sure they were also protected. And a plan was put together. The only way they might get the boys out alive was to sedate them. They used a mixture of ketamine, xanax, and atropine to try to dry up fluids so they wouldn't choke on their own saliva. The Wild Boars were knocked out. In some cases, they were barely breathing. Each boy was given a full face mask, then packaged up - strapped to a kind of stretcher, tied hand and foot with cable ties. The team set up a system of relays which the divers took them through - sometimes holding them close to their bodies, sometimes pushing them ahead, round the twisting s-bends of the caves. They even rigged up a pulley system on the roof of the cave and pulled them along. Vernon remembers that two of the boys started to wake up during the rescue. "They were given a quick jab to get them unconscious (again)." One by one, the boys were brought out. "For us, it was a situation where four had miraculously come out alive, but we had to stay grounded - because it didn't mean that the next nine were going to come out alive," he says. 'None of us are heroes' By the end of day two, eight of the boys were out. Four boys and their coach were still trapped. And the conditions were getting worse. "The rain that was forecast actually came earlier than we expected. It was 50/50 whether the dive went ahead on that morning." But it did, just. "One of the divers lost his dive line whilst carrying one of the precious packages, but he made it out as well. "And literally, after the last boy was on his way out of the cave, the floodwaters just suddenly started to come through. "What was meant to be was meant to be," says Vernon. In Thailand, superstition and belief in mystical powers is prevalent. Lots of places across the country are said to have various powers, especially caves. Tham Luang is associated with the myth of Nang Non, a princess who ran off with a lover and ended up taking her own life. She was supposedly pregnant with his child. The rivers inside the cave system are believed to be her blood. Today, a year on, Tham Luang has become a tourist attraction. Many Thais stop and briefly pay their respects at the shrine there - only now it is not just to the princess, but to Saman Gunan, the one person who died. He was a Thai diver who lost his life while delivering oxygen tanks just before they started the rescue effort. A statue of Saman was unveiled outside the cave complex six months after the rescue, to commemorate him. As for Vernon, he still spends a lot of his time in the area. He's been back inside the caves several times since the rescue. For him, something has changed. "Now before I go into the cave and when I come out I have a little prayer. I give her some flowers every time I go in now and when I come out I thank her for keeping me safe, which I've never ever done before. But it's just how I feel about the whole thing. "None of us are heroes. We've just done a job that we were asked to do and we did it to the best of what we were able to do. "It wasn't always easy but 13 isn't an unlucky number any more, is it?" This episode of the Beyond Today podcast is available here.
Mr Piech had criticised his chief executive in an interview with the German news magazine Der Spiegel, but did not specify the issue at stake. Mr Winterkorn has been widely tipped as VW's next chairman. Mr Piech and the Porsche family control 51% of VW. Volkswagen is the biggest car manufacturer in Europe. On 17 April, Volkswagen's five-member governing board gave its backing to Mr Winterkorn. Board member Wolfgang Porsche, a cousin of Mr Piech, said he had given his "personal opinion" without clearing his remarks with other family members. Mr Piech, 78, is a former VW chief executive. His wife Ursula has also resigned her seat on the board. "The members of the steering committee came to a consensus that, in the light of the past weeks, the mutual trust necessary for successful cooperation was no longer there," the board said a statement. The carmaker added that deputy board chairman Berthold Huber would serve as interim chairman. "The uncertainty had to be ended today," said Mr Huber. "The steering committee was and is conscious of its responsibility to Volkswagen and its many thousand staff." 'Seismic shift' During his eight-year tenure as chief executive, Mr Winterkorn has overhauled VW and made it one of the world's most successful carmakers, industry analysts say. He had been seen as a close ally of Mr Piech until relations became strained, reportedly over difficulties in breaking into the lucrative US market. "Mr Piech's departure represents a seismic shift in Volkswagen's power structure, and could foretell drastic changes in how one of the world's largest automakers operates," said Karl Brauer at automotive research group Kelley Blue Book. In 2014, VW was the world's second-biggest carmaker by sales, behind Toyota and ahead of GM. Apart from Volkswagen, the group's brands include Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bugatti, Bentley, Skoda and Seat.
Exports rose by 8.7% from a year ago in US dollar terms, beating estimates of 7%, after strong demand from Europe. Imports shot up by 14.8%, compared with estimates of 8.5%, thanks to purchases of processing and assembly products. Overall, China's trade surplus widened to $40.8bn (£31.5bn) from $38bn in April. Data released on Thursday also showed China's foreign exchange reserves rose by more than expected in May as tougher capital restrictions took effect. However, many analysts warn that China's growth is likely to slow gradually in coming quarters. "Today's trade data surprised on the upside, but has not changed our overall view that real GDP growth likely peaked in the first quarter," investment bank Nomura said in a report. Growth risks Moody's Investors Service downgraded China's credit rating last month on concerns that its financial strength would be eroded in the coming years by rising debts. Much of China's growth since the financial crisis has come from massive government-led stimulus spending on infrastructure. But the rise of zombie factories and ghost cities, an increase in capital outflows and the collapse in commodity prices seem finally to be taking their toll. China's government has been forced to take steps to cool the property market and clamp down on speculative market activity. Investors are also worried about China's potential economic tensions with the US, its biggest trading partner after the European Union. Before entering the White House, US President Donald Trump pledged to shrink the country's gap with China. Following a meeting in April with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Florida, the two sides have agreed to 100 days of trade talks which have borne some fruit.
By Tim McDonaldBusiness reporter, BBC News, Singapore And yet, here they both were, available in vending machines next to a hairdresser and a dialysis clinic. I wondered idly if I could whip up a vending machine surf and turf, and whether it would be any good. There was only one way to find out. I opted for sliced sashimi-style salmon and an Australian Wagyu striploin. The nearest salad vending machine was in the next neighbourhood. So I put off vegetables for another day. Pizza, cacti and anything else Vending machines are having a moment in Singapore. It's not just Wagyu beef and salmon. Machines offer bread, curry puffs, freshly cooked pizza, freshly squeezed orange juice and even cooked chilli crab, a famously messy local favourite that costs $60 (£33). Drinks and snacks still dominate, but the variety is increasing. One company has set up a chain of cafes that serve hot local dishes from machines. There's also a small chain of unstaffed convenience stores, selling everything from plasters to baked beans out of machines. One local retailer has a book vending machine, while another company sells cacti. Market research firm Euromonitor says vending machine revenues in Singapore grew about 15% from $91m in 2014 to $104.5m in 2019. Last year was tipped to be a bad one due to the pandemic, but growth is expected to resume this year. Why Singapore? The reasons vending entrepreneurs are trying out new products are as varied as the businesses themselves. Manish Kumar, the managing director of Norwegian Salmon, says machines offer him his own retail space. That means his frozen products aren't placed next to fresh salmon, which is more popular here. Mervin Tham, one of the three founders of EasyMeat, whose machines sell the Wagyu beef, thinks the variety is expanding because the barriers to entry are fairly low. "It's a low effort way of testing a product, especially if you're starting a business of your own. And generally there's some interest towards the automated retail culture that you see overseas, like in Japan," he says. Elaborate prank or popular meal? The Norwegian Salmon ATM dispensed my sliced sashimi, which was frozen in a vacuum-sealed pack with a packet of soy sauce and a small wooden fork. It's such an oddly specific product that when the machines started to appear around Singapore I wondered if it might be an elaborate prank or a weird art project. "A lot of people have told me that," says Mr Kumar. Still, he says locals are coming around to the idea. Currently, there are 110 machines, and he thinks there are enough customers in Singapore to support 900. And the more machines, the better. Most operate on slim margins, which means decent profits depend on having many machines and enough people to buy from them. Mr Kumar says a compact, densely populated city like Singapore is ideal. Pandemic ready? In Japan, which has more machines per capita than any other country, the pandemic has hit the industry hard, mostly because of reduced foot traffic. Euromonitor's report also predicted a significant drop for Singapore's machines. But vending machines have played a key role in Singapore's pandemic response, with the charitable arm of the country's sovereign wealth fund Temasek installing 1,200 of them around the island to dispense free masks. Mr Kumar says his own machines did well, with sales surging elevenfold during Singapore's circuit breaker period, which restricted movement between April and June last year. "It's 24/7, contactless, safe to buy, safe to eat. No need to go to any superstore. Social distancing is there. In six seconds, you get your product. You go," he says. Cost and convenience It took me 30 minutes on a bus to get to the Wagyu vending machine, so the sign on the side of the machine saying "Wagyu near you" wasn't strictly true. But EasyMeat is a new company with only a few machines, and the firm's founders have plans to expand. In a city where almost everything can be delivered, they are keenly aware that convenience is always a key selling point. Co-founder Mervin Tham says they started the business partly because they had all separately wanted sliced Wagyu beef for shabu shabu hot pot dishes after midnight, and had been unable to get it. "Sometimes when the weather is cold, in Asian cultures you do like to have steamboats or hot pots. And sometimes you find yourself not having Wagyu when you want it," Mr Tham says. He says there is a gap between bricks and mortar and e-commerce. If the supermarket is closed, the obvious alternative is to order it online. But it often takes several days to arrive, the customer might have to wait at home for several hours to receive a frozen delivery and there might be a minimum order. A vending machine solves these problems. Wagyu beef seems like an unusual impulse buy, but Mr Tham says the machines' data shows that many customers buy after midnight. "I have no idea who are the night owls that would camp out that late for supper," he says. Surf and turf The salmon and the steak both came out of the vending machine frozen solid in vacuum-sealed containers, so I let them thaw out on the ride home, and then for another few hours once I reached my kitchen. The salmon didn't require any preparation beyond taking it out of the packaging. But I had to cook the $24 Wagyu on the stove-top, a slightly daunting prospect for a culinary bungler like me. So I opted for the simplest possible approach: lightly seasoned and cooked in a pan with some oil. The surf and turf scored 7.5 out of 10, which is better than I expected. The salmon was flavourful, although I would have liked some wasabi with it. The steak was tender, fatty and very tasty. I cooked it a touch too long and my presentation was sloppy at best. But I can hardly blame a machine for that.
Syria's head of antiquities was quoted as saying the temple was blown up on Sunday. The UK -based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) reported that it happened a month ago. IS took control of Palmyra in May, sparking fears for the site. It is considered one of the ancient world's most important cultural centres. The ancient city, which is a Unesco World Heritage site, is famed for its well-preserved Graeco-Roman ruins, and the Baalshamin temple, built nearly 2,000 years ago, is one of the city's best-known buildings. The Islamic State group has destroyed several ancient sites in Iraq. The militants believe any shrines or statues implying the existence of another deity are sacrilege and idolatry, and should be destroyed. IS "placed a large quantity of explosives in the temple of Baalshamin today [Sunday] and then blew it up causing much damage to the temple," Syrian antiquities chief Maamoun Abdul Karim told AFP news agency. "The cella (inner area of the temple) was destroyed and the columns around collapsed," he said. Emma Loosley, a professor at Exeter University who lived near the ancient city for three years, said the temple's cella was "pretty much perfect". "I can't think of another temple as beautifully preserved as the temple of Baalshamin, and what was special about Palmyra was that it was a unique culture," she told the BBC. "It had its own gods, its own form of art and architecture that you don't get anywhere else." Ancient city of Palmyra IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' Syrian ruins that influenced the West Palmyra 'was archaeologist's passion' Your memories of Palmyra The Baalshamin temple is dedicated to the Phoenician god of storms and fertilising rains, and was almost completely intact. The oldest parts of the temple are thought to have dated from the year 17AD. Residents who had fled from Palmyra also said IS had planted explosives at the temple, although they had done it about one month ago, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Last month, IS published photos of militants destroying what it said were artefacts looted at Palmyra. A week ago, it emerged that the archaeologist who had looked after Palmyra's ruins for four decades, Khaled al-Asaad, had been beheaded by the militant group. Mr Abdul Karim said the 81-year-old had refused to tell IS where some treasures had been hidden, in an effort to save them. The group has also published photos of what they said was the destruction of two Islamic shrines near Palmyra, which they described as "manifestations of polytheism". The modern city of Palmyra - known locally as Tadmur - is situated in a strategically important area on the road between the Syrian capital, Damascus, and the eastern city of Deir al-Zour. IS attacks on historical sites and artefacts January: IS ransacks the central library in the Iraqi city of Mosul, burning thousands of books. February: A video emerges showing the destruction of ancient artefacts at the central museum in Mosul. March: IS uses explosives and bulldozers on Nimrud, one of Iraq's greatest archaeological treasures. Shortly after, IS militants destroy ruins at Hatra. How to save artefacts from militants Can IS looting be stopped?
The base, at the Mina Salman Port in Bahrain, will host ships including destroyers and aircraft carriers. The UK said it was an "expansion of the Royal Navy's footprint" and would "reinforce stability" in the Gulf. Bahrain will pay most of the £15m ($23m) needed to build the base, with the British paying ongoing costs. UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, who signed the deal at a security conference in Manama, Bahrain, said it was "just one example of our growing partnership with Gulf partners to tackle shared strategic and regional threats". He said the move "builds upon our 30-year track record of Gulf patrols" and would allow the UK and its allies in the region to "tackle the threats we face together". "To our partners in the Gulf my message is this: Your security concerns are our security concerns," he told the conference. Mr Hammond said the new base showed Britain's commitment to a "sustained presence east of Suez" - referring to the wording of a 1968 decision to close bases east of Suez by 1971. Labour's shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said his party "supports the Royal Navy having a strong international footprint", but said the government must "clearly set out its reasons for making this particular decision at this time." BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner there was already a "rotating presence" of four British minesweepers at the Mina Salman Port, but the UK had been "piggybacking" on the US naval base there. He said the new facility would be one of the most important Royal Navy bases in the world and would be used for a "whole host of things" including supporting UK operations in Iraq, where RAF jets have been attacking targets as part of a US-led coalition against Islamic State (IS) militants. The base would also be used for operations against piracy and for aerial surveillance, he added. "The deal will have its detractors. Bahrain has been heavily criticised for its human rights record in the past and despite some reforms, power remains concentrated in the hands of the ruling family," our correspondent said. "The majority Shia population here complain of discrimination by their Sunni rulers. There will also be some who resent the prospect of western military forces being permanently based here." He also said the threat of IS may have made Gulf monarchies "content to invite British forces to set up on their soil". UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon added: "This new base is a permanent expansion of the Royal Navy's footprint and will enable Britain to send more and larger ships to reinforce stability in the Gulf." Bahrain's foreign minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed bin Mohammed Al-Khalifa said: "Bahrain looks forward to the early implementation of today's arrangement and to continuing to work with the UK and other partners to address threats to regional security."
Mr Snowden told the US ABC network he wanted his son to return home provided the justice system is applied "correctly" in his case. He added that his son had "spoken the truth" and made great sacrifices. Edward Snowden has been granted asylum by Russia despite requests from the US that he be returned. Lon Snowden appeared alongside his lawyer Bruce Fein on ABC television. "We have visas, we have a date, which we won't disclose right now because of the frenzy," Mr Fein said, referring to the planned visit to Moscow. Edward Snowden arrived in Moscow on 23 June from Hong Kong, after making revelations about a secret US data-gathering programme. He then spent more than five weeks in Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport's transit zone. He left the airport last week after having been granted the necessary documents. 'Poisoned the well' Mr Fein said he had spoken to Edward Snowden's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, who had told him he was safe. "He obviously is exhausted. But he's now needing a period of time where he can recoup his energy level and reflect on what he wishes to do," Mr Fein added. Lon Snowden said that "as a father", he wanted his son to return home, but had concerns over whether he would face a fair trial. "At this point, when you consider many of the statements made by our leaders... they are absolutely irresponsible," Mr Snowden said. "They have poisoned the well, so to speak, in terms of a potential jury pool," he added. The row has had diplomatic consequences, with the US cancelling a bilateral summit scheduled for September. Russia's decision to grant Mr Snowden asylum is seen as having worsened already tense relations between the two countries. However, diplomats from the two countries did go ahead with talks in Washington on Friday to discuss other issues. Mr Snowden is a former technical contractor for the US National Security Agency (NSA), who also once worked for the CIA. In June he leaked to the Guardian and Washington Post newspapers documents and details relating to NSA programmes that gather data on telephone calls and emails. Mr Snowden, 30, fled his home in Hawaii, where he worked at a small NSA installation, to Hong Kong, and subsequently to Russia. He faces espionage charges in the US.
Casting his ballot, Mr López Obrador, or Amlo for short, said there would be a "peaceful transformation" of Mexico. In his victory speech, he said that he wanted to "go down in history as a good president". We look at the five most pressing issues facing the man who will take over as president on 1 December. 1. Corruption Corruption is an overwhelming and widespread problem in Mexico. According to a 2017 report by anti-corruption pressure group Transparency International, 51% of Mexicans surveyed said they had had to pay a bribe to access public services, the highest rate in Latin America. At least 14 former or current governors are currently under investigation for corruption. While corruption at the highest levels of government is not a recent development in Mexico, revelations that the most vulnerable were defrauded by those in power did stir levels of public anger not seen before. In Veracruz, the administration of then-governor Javier Duarte was accused of purchasing fake medicines, leading to children with cancer being given water instead of chemotherapy. Outgoing President Enrique Peña Nieto himself did not escape criticism after his wife bought a house worth $7m (£5.3m) from a government contractor. Mr López Obrador tapped into public anger about corruption, promising to eradicate it, a promise he repeated in his victory speech. "Corruption is not a cultural phenomenon, it's the result of a regime in decline," he said. He also said that no-one who was guilty of corruption would be spared, "even brothers-in-arms". One of the concrete proposals he has put forward is to revise oil contracts awarded by the current administration to companies to check them for signs of corruption. Any contracts showing signs of anomalies will be addressed by Congress, he has said. 2. Security and impunity As well as corruption, Amlo mentioned impunity as one of his twin priorities. Levels of violence reached a record high in Mexico in 2017, with more than 25,000 people killed. But what many Mexicans voters complained about more than the number of killings was the fact that so many crimes go unpunished. The election campaign also saw an unprecedented number of politicians being killed, more than 130 since the registration process started in September, 48 of which were running for office in this election. Many were running in areas where drug gangs wield a lot of influence leading residents to ask if those running for office could be taken out how they could be protected. In his victory speech, Mr López Obrador blamed corruption for the violence in Mexico. However, except for his plan to meet daily at 06:00 with his public security cabinet, which he said would be put under a "unified command", he has given little detail about how he aims to tackle the endemic violence in Mexico. His predecessors in office declared a "war on drugs" which drove the number of murders even higher as drug cartels splintered and fought for control of disputed areas. Under President Enrique Peña Nieto, high-profile cartel bosses were arrested but the vacuum left again seemed to inflame turf wars. Amlo has said he will take a softer approach, saying that under his administration there would be "abrazos, no balazos" (hugs, not shoot-outs). However, when he mooted an amnesty for those involved in the drugs trade, it was met by widespread outrage and aides later said it would be restricted to farmers growing illicit crops. 3. Poverty and inequality Amlo and his advisers have argued that one of the main factors behind Mexico's high levels of violence is extreme poverty. He argues that unless young people have choices, they will be lured into illegality by criminal gangs. In order to prevent them from joining gangs, he has proposed offering scholarships and jobs to young people. Critics, however, have questioned how successful such a scheme could be when drug gangs offer fast money. He has also said he will help the elderly by doubling their pensions "from my first day in office". And in his victory speech, he also said he would work for "all Mexicans" giving special emphasis to helping indigenous people, who are among the poorest in Mexico. 4. Improving US relations Mr López Obrador was scathing in his criticism of US President Donald Trump during his campaign, something that analysts say won him extra votes from Mexicans angry at the insults Mr Trump had aimed at Mexicans. He said he would make Mr Trump "see reason" and "put him in his place". But now that he has been elected, Mr López Obrador has struck a much more conciliatory note, saying he would pursue a relationship of friendship and cooperation" with the US. Not only are the US a key trading partner for Mexico, US law enforcement agencies also cooperate closely with Mexican forces combating crime and drugs trafficking. And while President Trump has slammed Mexico for allegedly not doing enough to stop Central American migrants from crossing over to the US, the two countries have been working together. Along with Canada, they are also in the - currently deadlocked - talks on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). A tweet by President Trump congratulating Mr López Obrador suggests that former is also keen to start on a friendly footing after months of acrimony. With a massive 81% of Mexican exports going to the United States in 2017, the two countries have a vested interest in making their relationship work. 5. Kickstarting the economy Mexico's economy is the second-largest in Latin America but it has been a lot more sluggish than Mexican and investors had hoped for, and they are looking to Amlo to change that. In his victory speech, Mr López Obrador said his government would be fiscally disciplined and would not raise taxes. But critics have wondered from where he will source the money for the social programmes he has promised to deliver. Amlo has said that a crackdown on corruption will mean that his administration will have more money at its disposal as it will stop millions of pesos being embezzled.
Mr Carney told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that, looking at the UK as a whole, "we are now seeing house prices begin to recover, so it is a more generalised phenomenon". He said the only area where prices had not picked up was Northern Ireland. He also said there was little the bank could do to cool the London market, where prices were rising far faster. Cash Prices in London are rising by about 10% a year, but Mr Carney said a change in interest rate policy - not on the cards in any case until the recovery is well established - would not cool the market as a significant number of properties were bought without a mortgage. Asked if he was concerned about the very fast-spiralling London property market, Mr Carney said: "Much of what's driven in London, of course, is not mortgage-driven but is cash-driven. "It's driven, in many cases, by foreign buyers. We, as a central bank, can't influence that. "We change underwriting standards - it doesn't matter, there's not a mortgage. We change interest rates - it doesn't matter, there's not a mortgage, etc. "But we watch it and we watch the knock-on effect." 'Clarity' Mr Carney reiterated his belief that UK interest rates would not return to pre-crisis levels of around 5% until all spare capacity was being used in the economy. He said: "What we've had thus far is a consumer-led recovery. "What we haven't seen yet is business investment picking up. "It's part of the reason why we're trying to provide as much clarity to business that the path of monetary policy, the path of interest rates, is going to be calibrated very carefully, to ensure that only when we see sustainable growth in jobs, in incomes, and in spending will we make adjustments." Last week, Mr Carney overhauled the Bank's interest rate policy to reflect falling unemployment and the economic recovery. The Bank's rate policy will now be determined not just by unemployment, but by a wider range of indicators. Limits Mr Carney also discussed bankers' bonuses, saying new rules ordering banks to keep back more capital could hold back bonus payouts. He said the rules, designed to protect banks from future economic shocks, would prevent them from paying increased bonuses if that would cause capital levels to fall. The rules, known as Basel III, will come into force near the end of this decade and will apply internationally. Mr Carney said they would have a real impact and should change banks' behaviour. He also suggested that bonuses could be deferred for an even longer period than the current three to five years, giving a greater time frame in which they could be clawed back, should it emerge later on that unnecessary risks had been taken. Last week, Barclays increased its bonus pool despite posting a fall in annual profits.
Officials say Yanjun Xu tried to steal trade secrets from US aviation and aerospace companies on behalf of China. He was arrested in Belgium earlier this year and on Tuesday extradited to the US. On Thursday, Beijing dismissed the espionage accusations against the official, saying there was no basis to the charges. China said it hoped the US would safeguard the legal rights of the Chinese individual, a foreign ministry spokesman said at a regular news briefing. A senior US justice department official said the case was "part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense". "We cannot tolerate a nation's stealing our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower," Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers added. Prosecutors say Mr Xu is a senior officer with China's ministry of state security - which is responsible for counter-intelligence, foreign intelligence and political security. He was detained in Belgium on 1 April at the request of the US. He was later indicted by an Ohio grand jury on four charges of conspiring to commit economic espionage and attempting to steal trade secrets. The indictment was unsealed on Wednesday following the suspect's extradition. Prosecutors allege that from 2013 Mr Xu targeted leading aviation companies as well as industry experts to obtain "highly sensitive" technical information. They say he invited employees to travel to China for an "exchange of ideas" or under the guise of delivering university presentations. Ohio-based aircraft engine giant GE Aviation was identified as one of the targets of the alleged operation. Conspiracy and attempt to commit economic espionage carries a maximum US prison sentence of 15 years, and conspiracy to commit theft of trade secrets can carry a 10-year term. The charges come at a time of raised tension between the US and China. The two countries have become embroiled in an escalating trade war and President Trump has accused Beijing of trying to meddle in the upcoming mid-term elections. In a speech last week, US Vice-President Mike Pence accused Beijing of directing "its bureaucrats and businesses to obtain American intellectual property - the foundation of our economic leadership - by any means necessary".
By Rachel SchraerHealth reporter A study of 37 participants has shown a build-up of the stress hormone cortisol can be measured from the oily secretions around your ear canal. This could open the door to better ways of diagnosing psychiatric conditions including depression, according to lead author Dr Andres Herane-Vives. He has also developed a new type of swab which won't damage the eardrum. Cortisol is known as your "fight or flight" hormone. When it sends out alarm signals to the brain in response to stress, it can influence almost every system in the body, from the immune system to digestion and sleep. But its role in disorders including anxiety and depression is not fully understood. Dr Herane-Vives, a psychiatrist at University College London Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, wants to understand what raised or lowered levels of cortisol might indicate. It's early days but he hopes this could eventually help him establish an "objective biological measure" for psychiatric conditions. In theory, people with mental health symptoms could have their levels of cortisol tested, and this could help to inform their diagnosis. Currently, mental health diagnosis is largely subjective, so this could provide professionals with an additional tool to help make their assessments more accurate. And a good diagnosis is "the only way to provide the right treatment", said Dr Herane-Vives. It could potentially be used to inform who might or might not benefit from anti-depressants. Cortisol can be measured in blood, but this only gives a snapshot of an individual's levels of the hormone in that moment. And since blood tests themselves can be stressful, this can potentially give false positives. Dr Herane-Vives wanted to see if a patient's chronic cortisol levels - what they looked like over a longer period of time - could be measured by looking at tissues in the body where it accumulates. He previously studied whether cortisol could be measured from hair follicles, but to do that you need 3cm of hair - which not everyone has, or wants to lose. "But cortisol levels in earwax appear to be more stable," he said. Dr Herane-Vives pointed to analogies with another wax-producing creature: bees. They store sugar in their waxy honeycomb, where it is preserved at room temperature. Similarly, hormones and other substances are stored over time in the earwax, which "yielded more cortisol than hair samples", the researchers said. Over the longer term, the method could be developed to measure other things like glucose levels or even antibodies against viruses. Follow Rachel on Twitter
By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent A study says the haze lasted much longer because the melting ice and increased snowfall altered wind circulation patterns. If Arctic ice continues to shrink due to climate change, the scientists say similar events will likely recur. They argue that this could threaten the Beijing Winter Olympics set for 2022. Emissions puzzle Air quality issues have plagued China in recent years but the pollution experienced in January 2013 was significant because it lasted so long. The large-scale haze stayed in place for almost a month and around 70% of China's 74 major cities exceeded the daily air quality standard for very fine particulate matter, which poses serious risks to health. Scientists were puzzled by the event as the Chinese government had taken steps to curb emissions from coal fired power plants, one of the most significant contributors to air pollution. Now researchers say that record Arctic sea ice decline in late 2012, plus extensive snowfall over Siberia disturbed wind patterns and produced stagnant air conditions over the east China plain. "In wintertime, in regions like Beijing you get these north west howling winds that blow like hell," said Prof Yuhang Wang from Georgia Tech University, one of the report's authors. "A ridge system controls the intensity and location of this cold air moving south so what happens when you put in sea ice forcing or snow forcing, the ridge system gets weaker and moves eastward - instead of cold air blowing in the eastern part of China, it went to Korea and Japan in January 2013." The research team looked at ventilation conditions over the past 35 years and were able to show that the poor dispersal seen in 2013 was unique. They then looked at the climate related factors that might contribute to poor ventilation and their findings indicate that the loss of Arctic ice and snowfall over the forests of Eurasia were critical for the haze event. The researchers weren't able to separate the scale of the impacts between these two factors. What they are sure about is that in combination, they made the haze much worse. "You see evidence in the summer that the particulate matter is getting less, but you don't see a clear trend in the winter and what we believe is that the effort is being hammered by changes in the Polar region with ice and snow," said Prof Wang. The researchers say that global climate change will likely ensure that Arctic sea ice continues to decline and maintain the conditions for haze events. They say this could threaten the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022 which will take place across a large geographical area. In their view it poses a greater threat to these future games, than dirty air did to the summer games in 2008. "Had the Chinese government not reduced emissions as much as they did in the last four years we would have seen the same or worse airpocalypse events," said Prof Wang. "We haven't seen it as much because of these emissions reductions and the study shows that if you want to clean up air during the Olympics they have to cut emissions even more drastically than they expected before." The authors say that while China can take more steps to curb particulate matter, curbing the greenhouse gases that are helping to shrink Arctic sea ice, will take a global effort. The study has been published in the journal, Science Advances. Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook.
By John SudworthBBC News, Beijing The government denies that it is attempting to alter the demographics of its far-western region and says the job transfers are designed to raise incomes and alleviate chronic rural unemployment and poverty. But our evidence suggests that - alongside the re-education camps built across Xinjiang in recent years - the policy involves a high risk of coercion and is similarly designed to assimilate minorities by changing their lifestyles and thinking. The study, which was meant for the eyes of senior officials but accidentally placed online, forms part of a BBC investigation based on propaganda reports, interviews, and visits to factories across China. And we ask questions about the possible connections between transferred Uighur labour and two major western brands, as international concern mounts over the extent to which it is already ingrained in global supply chains. In a village in southern Xinjiang, hay is being gathered in the fields and families are placing fruit and flatbreads on their supas, the low platforms around which Uighur family life has traditionally revolved. But the warm wind blowing across the Taklamakan desert is bringing with it worry and change. The video report, broadcast by China's Communist Party-run news channel, shows a group of officials in the centre of the village, sitting under a red banner advertising jobs in Anhui Province, 4,000km away. After two full days, the reporter's narration says, not a single person from the village has come forward to sign up, and so the officials begin moving from house to house. What follows is some of the most compelling footage of China's massive campaign to transfer Uighurs, Kazakhs and other minorities in Xinjiang into factory and manual labouring jobs, often considerable distances from their homes. Although it was broadcast in 2017, around the time the policy began to be intensified, the video has not featured in international news reporting until now. The officials speak to one father who is clearly reluctant to send his daughter, Buzaynap, so far away. "There must be someone else who'd like to go," he tries to plead. "We can make our living here, let us live a life like this." They speak directly to 19-year old Buzaynap, telling her that, if she stays she will be married soon and never able to leave. "Have a think, will you go?" they ask. Under the intense scrutiny of the government officials and state-TV journalists she shakes her head and replies, "I won't go." Still, the pressure continues until eventually, weeping, she concedes. "I'll go if others go," she says. The film ends with tearful goodbyes between mothers and daughters as Buzaynap and other similarly "mobilised" recruits leave their family and culture behind. Professor Laura Murphy is an expert in human rights and contemporary slavery at the UK's Sheffield Hallam University who lived in Xinjiang between 2004 and 2005 and has visited since. "This video is remarkable," she told the BBC. "The Chinese government continually says that people are volunteering to engage in these programmes, but this absolutely reveals that this is a system of coercion that people are not allowed to resist." "The other thing it shows is this ulterior motive," she said, "that although the narrative is one of lifting people out of poverty, there's a drive to entirely change people's lives, to separate families, disperse the population, change their language, their culture, their family structures, which is more likely to increase poverty than to decrease it." A marked shift in China's approach to its governance of Xinjiang can be traced back to two brutal attacks on pedestrians and commuters - in Beijing in 2013 and the city of Kunming in 2014 - which it blamed on Uighur Islamists and separatists. At the heart of its response - in both the camps and the work transfer schemes - has been a drive to replace "old" Uighur loyalties to culture and the Islamic faith with a "modern" materialist identity and an enforced allegiance to the Communist Party. This overarching goal of assimilating Uighurs into China's majority Han culture is made clear by an in-depth Chinese study of Xinjiang's job-transfer scheme, circulated to senior Chinese officials and seen by the BBC. Based on field work conducted in Xinjiang's Hotan Prefecture in May 2018, the report was inadvertently made publicly available online in December 2019 and then subsequently taken down a few months later. Written by a group of academics from Nankai University in the Chinese city of Tianjin, it concludes that the mass labour transfers are "an important method to influence, meld and assimilate Uighur minorities" and bring about a "transformation of their thinking." Uprooting them and relocating them elsewhere in the region or in other Chinese provinces, it says, "reduces Uighur population density." The report was discovered online by an overseas-based Uighur who passed it to Dr Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington. Before the university realized its error, Dr Zenz saved the report (in Chinese) on a web-archive site and has now written his own analysis of it, which includes an English translation of the full document. "This is an unprecedented, authoritative source written by leading academics and former government officials with high-level access to Xinjiang itself," Dr Zenz told the BBC. "The excess surplus population that somehow has to be dealt with, and labour transfers as a means to reduce the concentration of those workers in their own heartlands is, in my opinion, the most stunning admission of this report." His analysis includes a legal opinion from Erin Farrell Rosenberg, a former senior advisor to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum, that the Nankai Report provides "credible grounds" for the crimes against humanity of forcible transfer and persecution. In a written statement, the Chinese foreign ministry said, "The report reflects only the author's personal view and much of its contents are not in line with the facts." "We hope that journalists will use the authoritative information released by the Chinese government as the basis for reporting on Xinjiang." The Nankai report authors write glowingly of an effort to combat poverty underwritten by a "guarantee of voluntariness" in the work placements, and with the factories allowing the workers to "leave and return freely." But those claims are somewhat at odds with the level of detail they provide about the way the policy works in practice. There are "targets" to be reached, with Hotan Prefecture alone - at the time the study was undertaken - having already exported 250,000 workers, one fifth of its total working age population. There is pressure to meet the targets, with recruiting stations set up "in every village" and officials tasked to "mobilize collectively" and "visit households," just as in 19-year-old Buzaynap's case. And there are signs of control at every stage, with all recruits put through "political thought education," then transported to the factories in groups - sometimes as many as hundreds at a time - and "led and accompanied by political cadres in order to implement security and management." Farmers unwilling to leave their lands or herds behind are encouraged to transfer them to a centralized government scheme that manages them in their absence. And once they arrive in their new factory jobs, workers themselves are put under the "centralized management" of officials who "eat and live" with them. But the report also notes that the profound discrimination at the heart of the system is getting in the way of its effective functioning, with local police forces in eastern China so alarmed by the arrival of trainloads of Uighurs, that they are sometimes turned back. In places, it even warns that China's policies in Xinjiang may have been too extreme, for example, stating that the number of people placed in the re-education camps "far exceeds" those with suspected connections to extremism. "The entire Uighur population should not be assumed to be rioters," it says. The Huafu Textile Company is located on the edge of a grey industrial estate in the city of Huaibei, in China's eastern province of Anhui. It was to this factory that Buzaynap, featured in the state-TV report, was sent. When the BBC visited, the separate, five-story Uighur dormitory showed few signs of habitation apart from a pair of shoes placed by an open window. At the gate, the security guard said that the Uighur workers "have gone back home," adding that it was because of the country's Covid controls, and in a statement Huafu told us that, "the company does not currently employ Xinjiang workers." The BBC was able to find pillowcases made with Huafu yarn on sale on Amazon's UK website, although it is not possible to confirm if the product is linked to the particular factory we visited, or one of the company's other facilities. Amazon told the BBC that it does not tolerate the use of forced labour and that where it finds products that do not meet its supply chain standards, it removes them from sale. The BBC worked with a group of international journalists based in China, visiting a total of six factories between us. At the Dongguan Luzhou Shoes factory in Guangdong Province, one worker said the Uighur employees used separate dormitories and their own canteen, and another local told reporters that the company makes shoes for Skechers. The factory has previously been linked to the US company, with unverified social media videos purportedly showing Uighur workers making Skechers product lines, and references to a relationship in online Chinese business directories. In a statement, Skechers said it had "zero tolerance for forced labour," but did not answer questions about whether it used Dongguan Luzhou as a supplier. Dongguan Luzhou did not respond to a request for comment. Interviews recorded at the scene suggest the Uighur workers were free to leave the factory during their leisure time, but at other factories visited for the research, the evidence was more mixed. In at least two cases, reporters were told of some restrictions, and at one facility in the city of Wuhan a Han Chinese employee told the BBC that his 200 or so Uighur colleagues were not allowed out at all. Three months after Buzaynap was shown leaving her village to begin her political education training, the Chinese state-TV crew meet her again, this time in the Huafu Textile Company in Anhui. The theme of assimilation is, once again, central to the news report. In one scene, Buzaynap is close to tears as she is scolded for her mistakes, but eventually, a transformation is said to be taking place.

Extra security checks came in at some UK airports last week for flights to the US, but these will now be extended. The government says the checks apply to unspecified flights to and from the UK. It comes after an apparent terror threat prompted the US to announce extra security checks last week. But the Department for Transport (DfT) has now issued updated guidelines, saying: "In line with the US advice, passengers on some routes into and out of the UK may now also be required to show that electronic devices in their hand luggage are powered up or face not being allowed to bring the device onto the aircraft. "Passengers flying into or out of the UK are therefore advised to make sure electronic devices being carried in their hand luggage are charged before they travel." The department said that "for obvious reasons" it would not elaborate on the routes affected. "We will work with the aviation industry to minimise disruption as far as possible," said a spokesman. At the scene The BBC's Lyndsey Telford at Heathrow It's business as usual at Heathrow as countless passengers stream through security, bound for flights all over the world. Most seem unfazed by the ramped up measures and have come prepared, with only a handful at a cafe at Terminal 3 using the wall socket charging points to give their laptops, phones and tablets that last boost of power. Matt Bowdidge, who is flying home to Brisbane, Australia, has his gadgets and wires strewn across a table as he finishes his coffee before heading for security. "I want to make sure it's all fully charged," he says. "But it's no big deal. No one likes a lot of hassle when they travel, but I would rather turn on my phone and laptop for security than be blown up in the sky." It seems this is the general consensus. And as Vladimir Durovcik, who is flying to Vienna, said: "We're all one civilisation and we do what we can, no matter how small, to make sure we are all safe." 'Terror organisations' As well as mobile phones and laptops, the guidance set out by the DfT also includes a range of other electronic devices such as electrical shavers, travel irons, hairdryers, hair-straighteners and cameras or any other camera equipment. Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said the tightening of security measures at airports reflected "the fact that there are terror organisations that seek to do UK citizens, the UK and citizens of other countries harm". UK Airport security 228m passengers on international flights to and from the UK per year 91% people over 16 use a mobile phone in the UK 20,000 fly daily from Heathrow to the US 4,500 charging points at Heathrow 40+ UK airports fly to international destinations American officials ordered some overseas airports with direct flights to the US to intensify screening of electronic devices last week. This prompted Heathrow and Manchester airports to advise US-bound passengers to charge electronic devices to be carried as hand baggage before travelling on Monday. British Airways said customers with uncharged devices would not be allowed to fly and would have to rebook their flights or else leave their device behind and board their flight without it. It said these passengers will either be able to collect the device on their return or have it forwarded to another address, at the airline's expense. Virgin Atlantic said it would also store uncharged devices for customers at the airport. But after initially saying the cost of returning devices rested with passengers, the airline later revised its decision and said passengers would not be charged. Meanwhile, EasyJet said it was seeking clarification from government on the new regulations and had not, so far, issued any specific instructions to passengers. Analysis By Richard Westcott, Transport Correspondent The government has to keep everything deliberately vague because it doesn't want to give away any secrets to terrorists. So we simply don't know which routes are being scrutinised, which devices they are worried about, which airports are beefing up their checks, and so on. Instead, we've ended up with some blanket advice about US flights last week that has now been changed again today. My understanding is that this won't cause huge queues at security. They're unlikely to check your stuff if you're on a domestic flight or you're popping to France or Spain for your holidays. You may remember the chaos when they banned liquids in 2006; this won't be anything like that. In the end, if you stick to this rule, you'll be fine. If you're getting on a plane today, make sure anything with a battery has some charge in it. And carry your charger in your hand luggage just in case. Although the DfT said "some routes" into and out of the UK would be affected, specific details have not been released. The travel editor of the Independent newspaper, Simon Calder, said: "I think it's extremely unlikely that a charter flight from Manchester to Malaga or from Glasgow to Crete is going to be targeted by the DfT for scrutiny. "I can see however that flights to and from places with a recent history of terrorism - and I'm thinking here of maybe Egypt, maybe Kenya - there could well be added scrutiny for those flights." He said an average of 20,000 people travelled from the UK to the US per day but warned that the approaching summer holiday season would increase numbers. Airport security checks: Key questions answered What are the new restrictions on charging devices? Airline passengers entering and leaving the UK on potentially any route must be able to prove electronic and electrical devices in their hand luggage are sufficiently charged to be switched on when they get to security. What gadgets are included? The general advice applies to anything "with a battery", including mobile phones, MP3 players, electrical shavers, hair-straighteners, travel irons and cameras. What will happen if a device is not charged? Travellers with uncharged devices face having to rebook their flight. Alternatively they may be able to charge their device, post their device or leave it at the airport. Read more: What can you take on a plane? 'Credible' terror threat In a written parliamentary statement, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the country faced "a constantly evolving threat from terrorism". He said there was no change to the UK terror threat level, which remained at "substantial". US officials said last week they were aware of a "credible" terrorist threat, but have not linked the security changes to any specific intelligence. Analysts have suggested the action could be a response to efforts by Islamic militants in Syria and Yemen to build bombs that evade airport security checks.
Pupils who have begun secondary school this year will be the first to take the revised exams in 2017. Here, parents of children who will be affected by the changes give their reactions to the announcement. Karen Packham, Surrey The timetable for the new exams means that my two daughters will sit different exams from each other. But who is to say that they will happen to sit the style of exam that suits them as individuals? My daughters are currently in years seven and nine and due to sit their GCSEs in 2015 and 2017. One has just started secondary school is already facing a big increase in workload compared to primary school. I am not sure how she will cope having her exams at the end of two years. At least if students are assessed along the way, parents can help them manage the pressure little by little. I'm worried that schools won't have the time to change their teaching practices to guide pupils through a different system. I think it would have been better to fix what's there rather than pretend a clean sweep can sort out the problem. Schools should have a choice of exam board, so that they can assess their pupils and put them through a testing system that suits the kind of individual learner that they happen to be. Throughout primary school, teachers spend a lot of time making children realise that they are not all the same and that they learn in different ways. They make them see that they have choices about how they learn and that they can choose their own learning path. Changing the exam system seems to go against this. Catherine Hodgson, County Durham I have three children, the two older ones sat GCSEs and achieved very high grades, all A* and A. The youngest child will be examined under the 'improved' system, as he has just started secondary education. I feel the comments made by the government and its representatives have undervalued the GCSEs of previous years. It is frustrating from a parent's point of view seeing your children work so hard and having endured years of modular assessment - along with the stress - be demoralised by comments with such a negative view. I am looking forward to the 'improved system' to prove these sceptics wrong. There is enough pressure on children to achieve high grades without such demoralising comments from persons who pertain to have our children's best interests in their remit. I was examined under the 'O Level' system and I can say my children worked harder than I did and achieved similar results. I wait in anticipation for the turmoil this new system will cause our education providers who are under constant pressure to achieve or else. When will the government learn to let teachers teach, as that is what they are trained to do. Kay Cotterill, Worcestershire My son is 15 and so will miss out on the changes thankfully. He suffers from dyslexia and dyscalculus. When he has to sit formal examinations he becomes very ill with a stress-related illness and is often off sick from school. He would not cope well under the new system being introduced. In fact, I am sure that he would fail. Earlier this year he had a formal exam and he fell to pieces. He was predicted a C/D grade and got an F. But when it's a small assessment, he does fine. Schools need to look at the skill-set of the pupils to decide what route and exam would be best for them to take. When I sat my GCSEs, I did ok, but every single student is different. People have different learning methods and a singular exam cannot always assess capabilities. Liz Brimacombe, Devon My daughter will be one of the guinea pigs for this "new idea". It worries me greatly as great emphasis is placed on these results - until you get the next set of qualifications. She has just started secondary school and I hope that they are able to start the changeover from continuous assessment to exam focus now, otherwise that year will be ill-prepared. My final comment is that doing a limited amount of work all year and then cramming like mad for a three-hour exam (as was the case in the O-level days) is not a skill relevant to most jobs. Having to produce quality work, under deadlines, sometimes project based throughout a year is far more applicable in today's world.
In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said it was not until his late 20s that he processed the grief - after two years of "total chaos" and coming close to a "complete breakdown". But he was in a "good place" because of the "process I have been through". Harry, 32, also said boxing had "saved" him by helping him let out aggression. The Telegraph says Prince Harry had decided to talk about his past in the hope it would encourage people to break the stigma surrounding mental health issues. Along with his brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, he is promoting the Heads Together mental health campaign, the London Marathon's charity of the year. Speaking to the paper's Bryony Gordon, Prince Harry said: "I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well." He added: "I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and all sorts of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle." By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent This is a senior royal as we rarely see or hear them. Prince Harry is part of the future of an institution that once embodied the British stiff-upper-lip approach to life. Such an approach was dealt a blow by Diana, Princess of Wales. In her 1995 BBC Panorama interview, she told Martin Bashir about her post-natal depression, her self-harming and her bulimia. Now, Prince Harry is following his mother's example. In the podcast, which is a compelling listen, Harry admits to feeling nervous as he speaks openly about suffering from anxiety, coming close to a breakdown and being a "problem" for much of his 20s. Prince Harry is this country's most high profile person yet to talk about his personal mental anguish. His privileged life in a palace hasn't protected him from ill-health. Diana's son hopes that his up-front display of honesty will help to break the taboo that still surrounds mental health. Read more from Peter The Princess of Wales died in a car crash in Paris in August 1997. Prince Harry said: "My way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum, because why would that help?" "(I thought) it's only going to make you sad, it's not going to bring her back. So from an emotional side, I was like 'right, don't ever let your emotions be part of anything.'" He described himself as a "typical 20, 25, 28-year-old running around going 'life is great', or 'life is fine' and that was exactly it. "And then [I] started to have a few conversations and actually all of a sudden, all of this grief that I have never processed started to come to the forefront and I was like, there is actually a lot of stuff here that I need to deal with." He said he decided to act after his brother - the Duke of Cambridge - told him: "Look, you really need to deal with this. It is not normal to think that nothing has affected you." Prince Harry opened up to the Telegraph's Bryony Gordon over a cup of tea at Kensington Palace during a half-hour interview recorded for a podcast on mental health issues. Gordon, who has previously spoken of her own struggles with bulimia, alcoholism and an obsessive compulsive disorder, said the pair had been alone in the room. She said it had been unusual to hear a royal talk for half an hour on any subject and described Prince Harry as "really articulate and a sound guy". Prince Harry said: "Some of the best people or easiest people to speak to is a shrink or whoever - the Americans call them shrinks - someone you have never met before. "You sit down on the sofa and say 'listen, I don't actually need your advice. Can you just listen'. And you just let it all rip." 'Let out aggression' Asked whether he had counselling, he said: "I've done that a couple of times, more than a couple of times, but it's great." But he said he could "safely say" his concerns were not related to his service as a soldier in Afghanistan. On taking up boxing, Prince Harry told the paper: "Everyone was saying boxing is good for you and it's a really good way of letting out aggression. "And that really saved me because I was on the verge of punching someone." Prince Harry said: "Because of the process I have been through over the past two-and-a-half years, I've now been able to take my work seriously, been able to take my private life seriously as well, and been able to put blood, sweat and tears into the things that really make a difference and things that I think will make a difference to everybody else." A two-part series, Mind Over Marathon, starts on BBC One at 2100 BST on Thursday 20 April, as part of a Minds Matter series of programming about mental health issues.

They say the hold-up took place on Sunday morning at a jewellery exhibition at the Carlton Hotel. The hotel is located on the Croisette promenade - one of the most prestigious locations in the town. The theft is the largest in a series of high-profile robberies in Cannes, which is famous for its annual film festival. The Carlton Hotel is where Alfred Hitchcock filmed To Catch A Thief - his 1955 film about a jewel thief operating in the French Riviera. 'Rich pickings' During the latest theft, an exhibition of diamonds by the jeweller Leviev was being held in the lobby of the hotel. Local media said the robber made off with the jewels in a briefcase. It is not yet known who the owner was. If the value of the jewels is confirmed, it would reportedly be the second-largest heist in France. A Cannes police spokesman said: "A full and urgent operation is under way to catch the culprit and recover these jewels. Thieves see Cannes as rich pickings." The Cannes film festival, which attracts celebrities from around the world, was hit by two jewellery thefts in May this year. A necklace by Swiss jeweller De Grisogono reportedly worth 1.9m euros ($2.5m; £1.6m) vanished after a celebrity party at a five-star hotel in the resort town of Cap d'Antibes. A week before, more than 777,000 euros ($1m; £650,000) worth of jewels were taken from the hotel room of an employee of exclusive Swiss jewellers Chopard. The Carlton Hotel itself saw also a huge robbery in August 1994, when gunmen burst into its jewellery store just as it was closing and made off with jewels then valued at £30m (now $77m; £50m; 58m euros). France's biggest ever robbery took place in 2008, when three men stole almost every piece on display at a jewellery exhibition in Paris with an estimated value of 85m euros ($113m; £73m).
By Natalie HigginsBBC News, Brussels In normal times, this community near Valencia would have gathered in silence to remember their 35-year-old neighbour. But confined to their homes by coronavirus, they paid their respects at a distance. The bells tolled and Mozart's Requiem boomed out from the town hall as residents came to their windows and balconies. Carina was killed at home in front of her two young children. Her husband José turned himself in to the town's civil guard and confessed. National lockdowns have heightened the danger for women forced to stay at home with their abusers, cut off from the respite of work and less able to call for help undetected. Children, mostly home from school, are now even more exposed to trauma. Carina was the 17th woman killed by a current or ex-partner in Spain this year. She was the first since restrictions to try to limit the spread of Covid-19 were imposed. Fearing the aggressor indoors and virus outside Less than a month since Europe came to a near-standstill, it is too soon to see the full impact on gender violence from official statistics. But in abusive households, experts see a potentially devastating combination of emotions brewing. Women fear the aggressor inside the home and the virus outside. Stress makes abusers even more volatile, while heightened privacy gives them a feeling of impunity. In Spain, Kika Fumero traces it back to the state of alert declared on 14 March. "From that moment I knew that what was good for stopping Covid-19 was going to be horrible for those women and their children who were in a violent situation at home," the head of the Canary Islands Institute for Equality told the BBC. She had seen the spikes in abuse from periods of confinement before, when women were forced to spend more time with their partner during floods or holidays. Italy, like Spain, has been at the forefront of the pandemic. More than 100 doctors there have lost their lives treating the sick. Lorena Quaranta, 27, was on the brink of qualifying as a doctor when she died on 30 March. But she was not a victim of Covid-19. Her boyfriend Antonio told police he had killed her. When her coffin returned to her hometown of Favara in Sicily, people hung white sheets from their balconies. It represented, as Mayor Anna Alba put it, "the purity of her spirit, and the colour of that uniform she dreamed of wearing for the rest of her life". How abuse has spiked under lockdown France initially reported a sharp drop in calls to the national helpline. But within a week the government said police reports of domestic abuse had gone up nationally by a third, and by even more in Paris. An SMS service set up for people with hearing impairments now helps abuse victims too and receives 170 text messages a day. Drop-in areas have been opened in shopping centres and there is a support service for perpetrators "on the edge". In Spain, services for women facing gender-based violence are designated as essential, so their continued operation is guaranteed by the government. In the first two weeks of the state of alert, its 016 helpline received 18% more calls than in the same period the previous month. And, as in France, there are many silent requests for help. Email contact is up 286% over the same period and a new psychological support messaging service via WhatsApp received 168 enquiries in its first nine days. A mask to save a woman's life In Spain's Canary Islands, the Institute for Equality has launched a campaign called Mascarilla-19 (Mask-19), stressing that escaping abuse is a valid reason to leave your home. Pharmacies are widespread and among the few places people can still freely visit. "When a woman experiences violence at home or sexual assault, she can go to the nearest pharmacy and request Mask-19 - the mask that will save her life," says Kika Fumero, who came up with the idea. Pharmacy staff take a woman's name, address and phone number and alert the emergency services. She can go home, or wait until police and support workers arrive. One woman in Tenerife spent two weeks stuck at her partner's home after the state of alert was declared, before she was able to give the code word in a pharmacy while he waited outside. She has since filed a complaint and returned to her family home. A 78-year-old killed by her husband in Gran Canaria was the second victim of femicide during Spain's lockdown. "Older women endure mistreatment for 15 years on average before they report it," says the government's gender violence delegate Vicky Rosell. "Denounce it yourself. Do it for them. This too saves lives," she says. Mask-19 has now been adopted across Spain, as well as in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and Argentina. Why women may be trapped by lockdown Virginia Gil, who runs the Aspacia foundation in Madrid, fears the number of women reporting domestic abuse under the lockdown is "just the tip of the iceberg". Women face several barriers, she believes: fear of being discovered by their abuser, anxiety about possible coronavirus infection outside the home, and uncertainty about which local services are operating. Ms Gil fears some abusers who would ordinarily be removed from the home are not being taken into custody by police or brought before "paralysed" courts. How some countries are doing more than others In Russia, the dilemma about leaving or staying was particularly hard for Maria, living in a flat 113km (70 miles) west of Moscow. Maria, not her real name, had never been hit by her husband before. But on 26 March he flew into rage that lasted 18 hours. "At first, there was verbal abuse. Then he started breaking things and throwing them at me and the kids," she told BBC Russian. "He smashed everything up, from the fish tank to the fridge. My children were scared." She believes the catalyst for her husband's attack was President Vladimir Putin's announcement of a "non-working week" - and the loss of income that came with it. When he left to buy beer, she called the police. "They told me they couldn't throw him out because it was his flat," she said. It was up to her to find a shelter for herself and her children. Calls in Denmark for emergency accommodation almost doubled in the week after the government told people to stay at home. The government has since funded 55 extra rooms in shelters for four months and on Wednesday the lockdown will be eased, allowing some Danish schools to reopen and giving an opportunity for women to seek help. "One way or the other, we'll make sure there's room for everyone," says Susanne Lamhauge, head of a new crisis centre run by women's rights group Danner. In Belgium, Jean-Louis Simoens describes a three-fold increase in calls to the listening service of the Collective Against Family Violence and Exclusion (CVFE). "When I was manning the phones, a woman called and told me she only had 15 minutes to speak while her husband was out buying cigarettes. "She was very frightened and we had to talk really quickly. He had hit her so badly, her face was so swollen, that she couldn't open her eyes any more. The confinement had made his behaviour worse, so Mr Simoens helped her plan where to go if he went out. As calls are anonymous, he has no idea if she managed to escape. Why staying home is not always staying safe The threat of infection from coronavirus is in some cases a very direct obstacle to getting help, according to Marceline Naudi, who heads the Council of Europe's group of gender violence experts. In some cases, it means that women victims of violence have decided not to seek medical attention for fear of contagion, but there are also fewer places to turn to. "Domestic violence shelters in some areas have already stopped all admissions, because they are unsure how to manage the risk of infection," she says. She also fears that by losing a job or income women will become more financially dependent on an abuser and it will be harder to leave. In a pandemic that has killed tens of thousands of people across Europe, the message to an anxious public is that staying home means staying safe and saving lives. That mantra is of little comfort to women imprisoned with an abuser, weighing up their chances of a successful escape amid so much uncertainty. For many, it is an impossible choice.

The wounded man is said to have been captured. Earlier an intruder was arrested at district offices of Turkey's ruling AK Party. On Tuesday two members of a Marxist group took a prosecutor hostage at an Istanbul courthouse. All three died later in a shootout with police. The banned DHKP-C claimed that attack. Governor Vasip Sahin said that in Wednesday's attack, the woman assailant was carrying a bomb. At least one police officer was injured in the clash. TV footage showed the dead woman lying on the road near the police building. High-profile funeral Earlier on Wednesday hundreds thronged to the funeral of prosecutor Mehmet Selim Kiraz at the courthouse where he was shot dead. He had been investigating the death of a teenager who was hit on the head by a police tear gas canister during anti-government protests in 2013. The DHKP-C revolutionary group said their militants had acted to avenge the death of 15-year-old Berkin Elvan. Before the fatal shootout, the hostage-takers said the police blamed for Elvan's death must confess and be tried by "peoples' courts". At the prosecutor's funeral, Justice Minister Kenan Ipek called the attack "a gun directed at our nation". "We don't see this as an attack on our deceased prosecutor, but on the whole justice system," he said. His funeral later moved to the city's Eyup Sultan mosque, where Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu and ex-President Abdullah Gul were among the mourners. At least 19 members of the DHKP-C were detained in the southern city of Antalya on Wednesday, but it is not clear if this was connected to the hostage-taking.
By Katie Prescott Business reporter, BBC News He is describing the moment this week when Hong Kong's protests came to the central financial district , one of the world's biggest commercial hubs. He says it was a watershed moment, that's made him and many of his peers question their future in the city. Speaking to the BBC under condition of anonymity, directors at some of the biggest international banks and law firms said they are seeing their business in Hong Kong shrink as the protests continue to escalate. Financial services make up a fifth of Hong Kong's economy and people come from all over the world to live and work here. Its large expatriate community is attracted by the low taxes, well-paid jobs, stability and high standards of living. However, the lure of prosperity and stability in the East Asian hub has been undermined substantially since Hong Kong has been racked by five months of anti-government protests, backing increased democracy and opposing the actions of the police. Panic button This last week where violence has intensified has made many firms reconsider the safety of their staff in the city. One hedge fund manager has even been given a panic button app in case of an emergency and plans are in place with his work to evacuate him and his family to another major city "if we were in danger they have a team of people who would get us out". A banker at HSBC says only half of their staff came in to the office on Friday as people are encouraged to work remotely if they can't get in safely. Staff are kept closely informed about the situation on the ground according to a BNP Paribas employee "We get regular emails early in the morning and through the day from the business continuity management team - telling us whether it's safe to go into offices - and whether we should go home early." 'Pro-protester or pro-police' Anecdotally, the political pressure from the Chinese government on banks and law firms is also growing - and it's putting pressure on staff. Some partners in law firms are being asked to pin their colours to the mast and state whether they support the protesters or the Chinese government before winning business from Chinese firms. Firms are under pressure to keep a lid on their staff speaking in public about their views. One lawyer explains "I've been on calls where people are asked to verbally communicate restraint and caution when sharing their views. Given the amount of people we employ here, it's a minor miracle nothing has happened". In the workplace, people are making informal rules not to discuss the subject within their teams because emotions are running so high. "Clearly it's the only topic of conversation in the office, but opinions are so split," one banker says. "In my team of nine, three are Chinese and two are Hong Kong Chinese and the rest are expats - it's a bit like Brexit - we all have violently different views." A video on social media of a man who claims to work at Citigroup being arrested by police has been widely shared in the banking community. "This has scared people here - it makes you feel we could all get caught up in this" A spokesperson for the US-headquartered banking group said: "We are investigating this incident and while investigations continue it would be inappropriate to comment further". Losing business to Singapore One of the biggest concerns for financial firms is the impact all of this is having on the economy as its reputation for stability unravels. A source at one of the world's biggest international banks says it expects its Hong Kong revenue to be down by 25% in the last quarter of their financial year as a result of the violence. Many banks are now reviewing their investment plans in Hong Kong over the next few years "If we're still talking about this in six months time, people will start giving up on Hong Kong" They are concerned that people who are planning major deals will now turn to banks and law firms in Singapore because, in the words of one, "it has a more predictable medium-term outlook". So far most of the business impact has been on small companies - restaurants for example. There is concern amongst bankers, borne out in recent economic statistics, that this could spread more widely. "The classic company we deal with would be lending money to a Chinese shipping company that does its financial transactions through HK. They rely on a healthy business environment in Hong Kong. Now we worry they will go bankrupt".
In a new report, it said most North Koreans also lacked access to basic healthcare or sanitation. Diarrhoea and pneumonia are the two main causes of death for children under five, the report said. Humanitarian needs had been exacerbated by "recurrent natural hazards", such as frequent floods and drought. "Amidst political tensions, an estimated 18 million people across DPRK [North Korea] continue to suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition, as well as a lack of access to basic services," the UN report said. "Furthermore, 10.5 million people, or 41% of the total population, are undernourished." Isolated North Korea, which has a population of about 25 million, has faced significant food shortages for years. Hundreds of thousands are believed to have died during a widespread famine in the 1990s. The UN report said the situation had improved since then, "in part as a result of humanitarian assistance". However, two-thirds of North Koreans still depend on food being distributed by the state. The UN report said rations of items such as cereals and potatoes had been reduced from 380g per person per day to just 300g for several months last year. "Fluctuations over the year are normal," it said, but added that state "rations are consistently lower than the government target of an average of 573g per person per day". North Korea is heavily sanctioned under UN resolutions for its nuclear and missile tests. The report said international sanctions had affected humanitarian efforts, making it more difficult for agencies to transfer funds and equipment. It also noted a "radical decline in donor funding since 2012". "As a result agencies have been forced to significantly reduce the assistance they provide. Consequently, critical needs of some of the most vulnerable have not been met. "More predictable funding is urgently required to ensure the immediate needs of the most vulnerable are addressed."
A host of fellow stars descended on the Italian city's canals for the union between the film world's most eligible bachelor, 53, and Ms Alamuddin, 36. The ceremony was celebrated in a hotel overlooking the famous Grand Canal. Clooney's agent broke the news to journalists in a brief statement. According to AP news agency, that will be the only communication on the wedding. Clooney and his friends had sipped champagne before gliding up the Grand Canal on Saturday evening to the luxury Aman Hotel, waving to hundreds of well-wishers. Guests include Cindy Crawford, Bill Murray, Matt Damon and the U2 singer Bono. Clooney's boat was momentarily blocked by a passing cruise liner and then by a water bus, giving time for dozens of boats carrying photographers to catch up, AP writes. A police boat swerved in vain to try to keep the paparazzi away. Ms Alamuddin was last seen publicly on Friday riding in a water taxi down the Grand Canal with Clooney's arm round her. Assange defender The couple were engaged in April. Clooney was previously married to Talia Balsam, who he divorced in 1993. One of the world's most recognisable actors, the American has two Oscars to his name: for best supporting actor in Syriana (2006) and for best picture as producer of Argo (2013). Other than his film work, he has embraced human rights causes such as the Darfur crisis in Sudan. Lebanese-born British lawyer Amal Alamuddin has defended Julian Assange of Wikileaks and former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko among others. She met Clooney through her work. People in her native village in Lebanon, Baakline in the Chouf district, welcomed news of her impending marriage, AP reports. "We congratulate them and we hope that the happiness will be international," said shopkeeper Ghassan Bou Hatoum. The couple's choice of Venice for the wedding is apt as Clooney is a frequent visitor to its film festival. He also owns a villa on Lake Como, north of Milan. Despite the long build-up to the wedding, interest still abounded on social media at news of the knot being tied. "George Clooney is married," wrote one tweeter. "Heterosexual men of earth release a collective sigh of relief. Everyone else mourns."
The captain and two other crew members will remain in detention as they are facing weapons trafficking charges. Cuba said that the Soviet-era jet planes and weapons were being taken to North Korea to be repaired. But the United Nations says this was a breach of international sanctions against North Korea. The Panamanian authorities said that taking the cargo through the canal endangered the country's internal security. Earlier this month, the ship's owners agreed to pay $670,000 (£400,000) to have the vessel released. Documents have been found showing that "the ship's captain, the first officer and the political officer had been given instructions about what to do if the illegal shipment was detected," prosecutor Nahaniel Murgas said. The 32 crew members also gave statements denying knowledge of the illegal cargo. As a result they are being released without charge, but the captain and the other crew members face 12-year sentences for arms smuggling. "Ageing weapons" The container ship - the Chong Chon Gang - was stopped near Manzanillo, on the Atlantic side of the canal, on 15 July under suspicion that it was carrying drugs. It had disappeared from satellite tracking for a few days as it approached the Cuban capital, Havana, having departed from Russia's eastern coast three months earlier. Officials found 25 containers of military hardware, including two Soviet-era MiG-21 fighter aircraft, air defence systems, missiles and command and control vehicles. Cuban authorities said that the ship was carrying 240 tonnes of "obsolete" defensive weapons. A United Nations panel of experts was sent to Panama three weeks later. The North Korean government had called on Panama to release the vessel. "This cargo is nothing but ageing weapons which are to be sent back to Cuba after overhauling them according to a legitimate contract," the North's foreign ministry was quoted as saying by the state-run Central News Agency. The UN team later published a preliminary report saying that sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear programme had been violated. Under UN sanctions, North Korea is banned from weapons exports and the import of all but small arms.
By Anthony ReubenHead of statistics, BBC News In its 34 member states, the richest 10% of the population earn 9.6 times the income of the poorest 10%. There is no standard measure of inequality, but most indicators suggest it slowed or fell during the financial crisis and is now growing again. The OECD warns that such inequality is a threat to economic growth. The report says this is partly because there is a wider gap in education in the most unequal countries, which leads to a less effective workforce. OECD member states include most of the European Union as well as developed economies such as the US, Canada, Australia and Japan. One of the factors that the OECD blames for growing inequality is the growth in what it calls non-standard work, which includes temporary contracts and self-employment. The OECD says that since the mid-1990s more than half of all job creation in its member states has been in non-standard work. It says that households dependent on such work have higher poverty rates than other households and that this has led to greater inequality. It also says that tax and benefit systems have become less effective at redistributing income. On the other hand it says that one of the factors limiting the growth in inequality has been the increasing number of women working. The report says that one of the few areas where inequality has not been growing in the last 30 years has been Latin America, although levels of inequality were much higher there to start with. Analysis: Robert Peston, economics editor The main theory the OECD puts forward for why inequality and growth are negatively correlated is that poorer people invest less in their own education and self improvement - which is why its main anti-inequality prescriptions are government investment in skills and education, and a focus on a promoting better quality jobs. Strikingly it isn't saying that the best way to greater equality and faster growth is to soak the rich. Instead it wants activism focused on raising the living standards of the poorest, especially the poorest 40%. It calculates, therefore, that if living standards in the UK for poorer people were raised to the relative levels of France - that if so-called "bottom inequality" was reduced by half of a standard deviation (to use the jargon) - annual growth in national income or GDP would rise by 0.3% every year for 25 years. That's not to be sniffed at. It would represent increasing our current growth rate by around 13%. Read more from Robert One of the best-known commentators on inequality is Prof Joe Stiglitz from Columbia Business School. He told BBC News that the problem was not just with lack of training and education. "What we've seen, particularly in the last 15 years, is that even those who are college graduates have seen their incomes stagnate. The real problem is the rules of the game are stacked for the monopolists, the CEOs [chief executives] of corporations." "CEOs today get pay that's roughly 300 times that of ordinary workers - it used to be 20 or 30 times. No increase in productivity justifies this change in relative compensation." Behind the OECD averages there is a considerable range in the degrees of inequality in each country. Household wealth The Gini coefficient is a figure showing how well income is distributed across a country. A coefficient of zero would mean everybody was paid the same amount, while one would mean all the money was earned by one person. The average across the OECD was 0.32. Chile had the highest at 0.50, indicating that income distribution there was the most unequal, while Denmark was the lowest at 0.25, making it the most equal. The UK and US were both near the top of the rankings with coefficients of 0.35 and 0.40 respectively. One of the report's authors, Mark Pearson from the OECD, told BBC News: "It's not just income that we're seeing being very concentrated - you look at wealth and you find that the bottom 40% of the population in rich countries have only 3% of household wealth whereas the top 10% have over half of household wealth." "So that combination of both wealth and income being very concentrated, it means there is no equality of opportunity in many societies and that undermines our growth."
By Andrew NorthBBC News, Delhi His comments come as the Tibetan exile movement meets at its headquarters in the northern Indian town of Dharamsala to discuss its future strategy. There is growing concern over the number of Tibetans self-immolating or setting themselves on fire. Activists say 51 Tibetans have set themselves on fire since 2009. The Dalai Lama and the Tibetan government-in-exile are under increasing pressure - not just from Beijing but now also from their followers who are divided over how to continue their struggle against Chinese rule. Some of those gathering in Dharamsala this week want a more assertive policy, including more open backing of Tibetans setting themselves on fire, while others say this tactic is against Buddhist teachings and want another approach. The Dalai lama has steered a middle course. In a BBC interview, he said the immolations were a symptom of China's repressive rule in Tibet and called on its new leadership to accept the need for change. "The new leadership must use common sense and a more holistic view to serve long term-interest. There is no other way. "Just using force, censorship and to remain a closed society is almost like suicide. Judging that way, I feel there is possibility or a real chance to change." Beijing says Tibet is an integral part of China and accuses the Dalai Lama of trying to break the Himalayan region away. The Dalai Lama says he only wants greater autonomy. But, he said, it was getting harder to reach an agreement because of an increasing divide between ethnic Tibetans and the Han Chinese who have been encouraged to move there by Beijing.
For decades in the UK and abroad, Muslim discourse has been dominated by fundamentalism and Islamism. I spent two decades, starting in my teens, as an activist promoting these narrow and superficial misinterpretations of Islam in the UK, along with thousands of others here and millions in Muslim-majority countries, until deeper and wider experiences of faith and life helped me out of these intellectual and spiritual wastelands. These discourses need to be defeated, and the developing counter-narratives to these worldviews and mindsets need to be strengthened. By fundamentalism, I mean the reading of scripture out of context with no reference to history or a holistic view of the world. Specific examples of literalist, fundamentalist readings that still dominate Muslim attitudes worldwide are manifested in the resistance to progress in human rights, gender-equality and democratic socio-political reforms that are too-often heard from socially-conservative Muslims. The universal verses of the Koran (eg 49:13, "O humanity! We have created you from male and female and made you nations and tribes so that you may know each other: the most honoured of you with God are those most God-conscious: truly, God is Knowing, Wise") promote full human equality and leave no place for slavery, misogyny, xenophobia or racism. However, other Koranic verses that may seem to accommodate slavery, discrimination against non-Muslims and women and even wife-beating (eg 4:34) were clearly specific for their time and always meant as temporary measures in a process of liberation. Islam exalted the status of women and slaves in 7th Century Arabia. Ahistorical, fundamentalist readings treat these specific stages as universal and obstinately refuse any progress, effectively insisting on a return to 7th Century values for all societies at all times. Islamism is often described as "political Islam". A more accurate description would be "over-politicised, fundamentalist Islam", since believers have every right to build their politics on basic religious ideals such as truth, justice and the welfare of all people. The following may be regarded as the major components of Islamism: Umma, Khilafa, Sharia and Jihad - all of which have become excessively politicised. Umma (nation) translates for Islamists into an obsession with the "Muslim people" and its imagined suffering worldwide (the blessings are never counted, only the problems) that in turn becomes a firmly entrenched victimhood and perpetual sense of grievance. Conflicts involving Muslims with others are continually cited - Palestine, Kashmir, Afghanistan and Iraq - while ignoring savage internecine Muslim conflicts, such as the Iran-Iraq war or the current wars in Darfur and Syria, or the appalling persecution of Christians in many Muslim-majority countries such as Egypt, Iran and Pakistan. Khilafa (caliphate) for Islamists is the idea that they are duty bound to establish "Islamic states" - described by vague, theoretical, idealistic platitudes - that would then be united in a global, pan-Islamic state or "new caliphate". Sharia (law) for Islamists is the idea that they are duty-bound to implement and enforce medieval Islamic jurisprudence in their modern "Islamic state". Hence the obsession with enforcing the veiling of women, discriminating against women and non-Muslims and implementing penal codes that include amputations, floggings, beheadings and stonings to death, all seen as a sacred, God-given duty that cannot be changed. Jihad (sacred struggle) for Islamists is an obsession with violence, whether of a military, paramilitary or terrorist nature. Their Jihad aims to protect and expand the Islamic state. Extremists even dream of conquering the whole world for Islamism by militarily defeating the US, Europe, Israel, India, China and Russia. Counter-narratives to the Islamist narrative may be developed. The Koranic references to Umma include the historical aspect, such as the prophets of other faiths and their followers, a strong, interfaith and spiritual notion. In early Islam, Umma also referred to political communities that included Jews and Christians, such as Medina under the Prophet Muhammad. The Ottomans abandoned the legal pluralism of the "millet" system (a faith-community framework) in the 19th Century and adopted a citizenship model that granted equal rights to all, irrespective of religion. The founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, articulated the same vision for his new Muslim-majority state with Hindu, Sikh and Christian minorities, but these developments have been forgotten under the avalanche of fundamentalist Islamism over the past half-century. Sharia has had dozens of schools and interpretations over the centuries. Narrow approaches do not work in our modern world. The holistic approach to Sharia known as Maqasid al-Sharia (universal objectives of law) posits equality, justice and compassion as the basis of all law, and is the only way forward. The work of the recent or contemporary scholars Ibn Ashur, Nasr Abu Zayd and Ibn Bayyah are crucial in this regard. It has to be recognised that Koranic penal codes, always accompanied by exhortations to mercy and forgiveness, were often suspended or replaced by imprisonment or financial penalties in the early centuries of Islam, since punishment, deterrence, restorative justice and rehabilitation were the operative concerns. Also, arbitrary interpretations of Sharia were not enforced at state level in early Islam and most of Sharia is voluntary, relating to believers' daily worship and social transactions. The Koranic spirit of freedom, equality, justice and compassion must be reclaimed, with an emphasis on Sharia as ethics rather than rigid ritualism. The Koranic notion of Jihad is essentially about the sacred and physical-spiritual nature of life's struggles, as summed up by "strive in God", a verse revealed in the pacifist period of Islam before war was permitted. In our times, we need non-violent Jihads; social struggles against all forms of inequality and oppression, and for justice and liberation. Socio-political Jihads are needed to achieve the goals of noble causes such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, that may be seen as an extension of the themes of equality contained in the Prophet Muhammad's farewell sermon. The military aspects of Jihad are covered by the ethics of warfare. The voluminous Geneva Conventions are in keeping with the spirit of the Koran, which also has a strong pacifist message. Role-models for such counter-narratives include the many Muslim social reformers of the past century, such as Jinnah's sister Fatima, who is still an inspiration to millions of Pakistani women, and the many Muslim activists who contributed to the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa. More recently, the youth of the Arab spring, with an instinctive Islamic, Christian or humanist love of freedom and justice, have broken through the impasse maintained by dictatorships and their subservient clergy. Such counter-extremist, reform movements must be led at the grass-roots by community and intellectual activists. Democratic government has a role, but a healthy civil society is best-equipped to resist tyrannical dictatorship, whether religious or secular. We have much to do, but where there is faith, there is much hope. You can follow the Magazine on Twitter and on Facebook
By Sean CoughlanBBC News education and family correspondent Universities UK says otherwise overseas students, worth £26bn to the UK economy, will opt for countries such as the US, Canada and Australia. Research has shown Australia is already overtaking the UK as the second biggest destination for overseas students. The government has said there is no cap on legitimate overseas student numbers. This month, the Migration Advisory Committee, which gives the government independent advice on immigration, is to report on the impact of international students - currently counted as those from outside the UK and the European Union. The government has previously rejected calls to take international students out of migration targets. 'More welcoming' The university group is arguing for a more "welcoming" message, by giving international students the right to stay and work in the UK when they complete their courses - as they could before the rules were changed in 2012. The US, Australia and Canada allow international students to work after graduation - and Universities UK says that their research in countries such as India has shown this to be an important attraction. It is possible for students to stay after graduating in the UK. But there are thresholds on how much graduates must be earning, time limits for moving into work and requirements for sponsorship - and the universities want a less restricted approach. Prof Sir Steve Smith, of Universities UK, said the UK was "missing out" on the global growth in overseas students. The UK removed the right to work after claims that overseas students were over-staying and using student visas as a back-door route for migration. But Sir Steve said such claims had proved to be "factually incorrect" and the latest data showed that 98% of overseas students complied with their visa requirements. As well as the financial loss from deterring overseas students, he said, there was a risk of "extraordinary long-term damage" in terms of losing international influence and failing to recruit international talent for UK research. After Brexit, Sir Steve said there would be even greater demand for skilled workers and the UK needed to show it was "open for business". 'No limit' Overall international student numbers to the UK have increased by only 3% in the past decade - while the US has increased by 40%, Australia by 45% and Canada 57%. A study from University College London in July showed that the UK's longstanding position as the second biggest recruiter, behind the US, was being lost to Australia. China is the biggest source of international students for the UK, with about 95,000 students. There are about 17,000 students from India - but Universities UK says this number has halved over the past five years. Universities UK says the spending of overseas students supports more than 200,000 jobs - with an economic impact, across fees, travel and living costs worth £25.8bn, including £1bn in tax revenues. Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities, said that almost a third of their students were from overseas. "We support the call to give more international graduates the opportunity to work in the UK for a set period, once they finish their studies. This move would help preserve the UK's status as a magnet for global talent," said Mr Bradshaw. A Home Office spokeswoman said: "There is no limit on the number of genuine international students who can come to study in the UK. "We recognise the cultural and financial contribution which international students make to the UK, which is why we have developed an excellent post-study offer. "Graduates can stay if they get a graduate level job, get an internship or apply to set up a business in the UK. "Completing PhD students are also able to stay for an additional year to gain work experience or set up as an entrepreneur."
In a speech, the band's leader, known as RM, mentioned South Korea's shared "history of pain" with the US over the 1950-53 conflict, in which the two countries fought together. But his remarks have angered Chinese social media users, as Beijing backed the North in the war. The controversy also appears to have affected commercial deals. Adverts featuring BTS from companies including Samsung, sports brand Fila and car manufacturer Hyundai disappeared from a number of Chinese websites or social media platforms, although it is unclear who removed them. K-pop has a large following in China and BTS - one of the most successful groups - are no different, with at least five million fans on China's popular social media platform Weibo. RM's comments came as BTS received an award celebrating relations between the US and South Korea. "We will always remember the history of pain that our two nations shared together and the sacrifices of countless men and women," he said. But his words were met with an angry response by some social media users in China, who noted the losses their country also suffered in the war. "They [BTS] should not make any money from China," one user commented on Weibo, reported Reuters news agency. "If you want to make money from Chinese fans you have to consider Chinese feelings." According to the Global Times, a state-run newspaper with a nationalistic perspective, "Chinese netizens said the band's totally one-sided attitude to the Korean War hurts their feelings and negates history", adding that the comments were designed to "play up" to US audiences. Around 200,000 South Korean soldiers and 36,000 American soldiers died during the Korean War, as well as millions of civilians. Chinese state media say 180,000 soldiers from China also lost their lives. It was difficult to gauge the scale of the backlash to RM's comments among BTS's Chinese fan base. Some were calling on each other to stay low-key and quiet on Weibo posts. And a number of people on Twitter defended the group, noting that RM's speech did not mention China directly. The seven-member BTS is popular around the world and have broken a number of records. Earlier this year, their single Dynamite became the most viewed YouTube video in 24 hours, with 101.1 million views in a day. The controversy comes days before Big Hit Entertainment, the agency that manages BTS, is set to go public in Seoul in an initial public offering expected to value the company at up to $4bn (£3bn).
Maurice Robinson, from Craigavon, was remanded in custody at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court. The 39 bodies were found in the lorry trailer on an industrial estate in Grays, Essex, on Wednesday. Writing in a book of condolence, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the world had been "shocked by this tragedy". Mr Robinson, of Laurel Drive, appeared via video-link and is charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering. Prosecutor Ogheneruona Iguyovwe described the conspiracy charges as "a global ring" involving "the movement of a large number of illegal immigrants into the UK". Mr Robinson was not asked to indicate pleas and will next appear at the Old Bailey on 25 November. DNA tests are being carried out in Vietnam to help to identify the victims. The prime minister was joined at Thurrock Council's offices by Home Secretary Priti Patel and members of the emergency services. Writing in the book of condolence, Mr Johnson said: "The whole nation, and indeed the world had been shocked by this tragedy and the cruelty of the fate that has been suffered by innocent people who were hoping for a better life in this country. "In condemning the callousness of those responsible for this crime, we in the government of the United Kingdom resolve to do everything in our power to bring the perpetrators to justice." At the scene Richard Galpin, BBC News Inside the modern Thurrock Council chamber, surrounded by aides and officials from the emergency services, Boris Johnson bent down to write his message of condolence to the families of the 39 men and women who died inside the sealed container last week. He hesitated briefly before starting to write a long message expressing the shock in this country and beyond of what had happened. Other officials followed in what was a solemn occasion carried out in silence. The prime minister and home secretary then laid flowers in a small garden outside the council offices before heading back to central London. Ms Patel later told the House of Commons there would be an "increased presence" of Border Force officers at Purfleet, the Essex port where the container arrived. She also said an agreement had been reached with Belgian authorities to send additional immigration officers to Zeebrugge. Three other people arrested in connection with the deaths were released on bail on Sunday. Another driver, who is suspected of bringing the container to Zeebrugge before it crossed the Channel, was arrested at the port of Dublin on Saturday on unrelated charges. But Irish police, who are liaising with their Essex counterparts, said the man was the driver of a blue truck seized at Dublin port as part of the ongoing investigations into the 39 deaths. Detectives in Essex are now working on the largest mass fatality victim identification process in the force's history. Initially, police said the 31 men and eight women were Chinese but a number of Vietnamese families have described how they fear their loved ones are among the dead. Some of the victims are said to have paid thousands of pounds to guarantee their safe passage to the UK, from where they would be able to carry out work that would give them money to send home. Reuters reports that the UK government has sent documents to Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security in a bid to identify four of the 39 victims. Families in the country have shared their fears their loved ones could have been among those who died. Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on Tuesday night, saying her "trip to a foreign land has failed". Meanwhile, Nguyen Dinh Gia said he had not heard from his son Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, since he told him last week he was trying to join a group to get from Paris to the UK. Detectives are also investigating claims the lorry could have been part of a convoy of three carrying about 100 people.
The image, which shows a young boy hunched over a sewing machine making Union Jack bunting, disappeared from the side of a Poundland shop last week. It is now for sale in Miami, with an estimate of £320,000 - £452,000. Councillor Alan Strickland said there is "lots of anger" at the removal, and is campaigning for the work's return. "Residents have been really shocked and really astonished," he told the BBC. "Banksy gave that piece of art to our community, and people came from all over London to see it. He said residents are "disappointed" that a "piece of art that was given freely has been taken away from them and sold for an enormous profit". 'Above board' Fine Art Auctions in Miami described the work as "stencil and spray paint on render with additional jubilee bunting". It rejected suggestions that the mural was stolen, saying the listing came from a "well-known collector", who had signed a contract to say "everything was above board". The work appeared in Whymark Avenue, Wood Green, north London, in May last year. It is thought to be a commentary on the use of sweat-shop labour. Professor Paul Gough, an academic who studies street art, said it was likely to be a genuine Banksy, who works under a veil of anonymity, and rarely takes credit for his art. Poundland welcomed the arrival of the piece, saying they were "fans of Banksy", but rejecting any suggestion they were the target of his satire. Tim McDonnell, the store's retail director, said: "Poundland has a clear defined code of conduct for all our suppliers and a strong ethical stance on all labour issues." Councillor Strickland said residents noticed scaffolding go up around the store last Wednesday. "The scaffolding and tarpaulins came down on Friday, and on Saturday residents noticed that, where the Banksy had been, there was now a hole in the wall." Number of thefts The chain said it was not responsible for "either selling or removing the Banksy mural," saying it did not own the building. The owners of the property have been traced, and Haringey council is trying to contact them to establish whether the work was taken legitimately. Residents are also organising an email campaign, asking the auction company to abandon the sale. Banksy's work has been at the centre of a number of thefts over the years. In May 2010, two pieces were stolen from a gallery in London, after a man used a road sign to smash a glass window at the front of the building. A year later, a piece known as Sperm Alarm was ripped off the wall of a hotel in Central London, and appeared on eBay for £17,000. It was never recovered.
The country's anti-monopoly regulator said the companies were found to have colluded to reduce competition. Japan's Sumitomo Electric and Mitsubishi Electric were among the firms that received the heaviest fines. The ruling comes amid a crackdown on multinational firms found to have broken China's anti-monopoly laws. China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a statement the Japanese firms "improperly affected the pricing for auto parts, entire vehicles and bearings". Under China's anti-trust law, which was enacted in 2008, authorities can fine a company as much as 10% of its annual revenues. The state broadcaster CCTV said the fine was the biggest China had imposed since its anti-monopoly law took effect. China is the world's largest car market and auto makers have been under scrutiny following allegations they were earning high profits by overcharging customers. On Sunday, China's state-run news agency Xinhua said Mercedes-Benz had been found guilty of fixing the cost of spare parts. Other high profile car companies that have been targeted include BMW, Audi and Chrysler. No penalties on them have yet been announced. Corruption crackdown As part of its overall crackdown on corruption, the Chinese government has been conducting investigations into foreign business practices. Over the past year, multinational firms in the pharmaceutical, technology and food sectors have come under particular scrutiny. Last August, six producers of infant formula - all foreign companies - were given a record fine for price-fixing. As a result, there have been rising concerns in the foreign business community that they are being disproportionately targeted. However, China says it does not discriminate between domestic and overseas companies. "China is a country ruled by law, everyone should be equal before the law," Li Pumin, the secretary general of the NDRC, said on Wednesday. "It's no matter whether they are domestic or foreign-funded firms, they will receive a punishment as long as they violate laws," Mr Li said.
Christian Taxil, who represents the CFE-CGC union on the board, said conditions were "not right" for the £18bn project. The same union has previously suggested that investment in Hinkley Point C should be delayed until 2019. It said there were problems with a similar reactor design in France. Last week, French economy minister Emmanuel Macron said EDF would now make a final investment decision on the Hinkley Point nuclear reactor in early May. Mr Taxil expressed his opposition in a letter to EDF employees. He said EDF's weak financial position, technical issues and the current state of the energy market were all factors that had influenced him. Delay urged Meanwhile, it has also emerged that some EDF engineers have expressed renewed doubts about the reactor technology. In an internal company document, leaked to the Financial Times, they argued that a redesign was needed in order to make the plant less complex and less expensive. Instead of pledging that the plant would be operational in 2025, they said, the company should adopt a more "realistic" date of 2027. In response to the FT article, EDF issued a statement denouncing "unfounded rumours and fanciful stories". The firm added: "EDF refutes these rumours and confirms that the date of first operation of the first reactor is fixed at the end of 2025 and that no delay is anticipated. "EDF regards this anonymous press campaign as seriously harmful to our interests, as well as the interests of the industry and to jobs in France and Europe." Funding fears EDF, which is 85% French state-owned, has yet to outline how it will fund the project. In October last year, EDF agreed a deal under which China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) would pay a third of the cost of the project in exchange for a 33.5% stake. But EDF has been struggling to find the cash for its remaining 66.5% stake. Earlier this month, the company's chief executive, Jean-Bernard Levy, said that the financial context was "challenging" and that he was negotiating with the French government to secure more funding. The UK government has been criticised for guaranteeing a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour of electricity - more than twice the current cost - for the electricity Hinkley produces for 35 years. The UK government has said it is "committed" to Hinkley.
By Stephen McDonellBBC News, Beijing It brought waves of hype in China that the country was preparing to celebrate not only a festival of sport but the return of the "Middle Kingdom" to the centre of the universe. At least that is how it felt at the time. In the years leading up to the Olympics it was as if there was nothing this place could not achieve. The economy was charging ahead, newspapers were starting to dig up investigative stories, millions of poor people were able to buy electrical goods for the first time and bars and restaurants were heaving with 24-hour hedonistic temptation. "There was a party every night. That's how I felt," laughs 45-year-old architect Dong Hao. "The whole city; the whole country was not only about fun but that a lot of things were now possible. Everything was more tolerant and more liberal." Dong Hao is a native of Beijing and studied in New York. Before, say, 2005 you might have expected somebody like him to make his career overseas but the pre-Olympic potential drew him home. After all he is an architect and there was a building boom. The Olympics were coming and enormous structures with breath-taking designs were being erected at breakneck speed. Beijing Capital Airport, Beijing South Train Station, the National Centre for the Performing Arts, the Water Cube and, of course, the Bird's Nest Olympic stadium… up up up! "Everyone wanted something exciting and maybe it was unreasonable," says Dong Hao. "Maybe not functional, maybe not necessary: it doesn't matter, let's have it!" Some of the unique possibilities of the pre-Olympic frenzy may have dried up but that the process is now more considered, he says. "Now the market and the clients are more mature." Dong Hao adds that it is pretty hard to impress anyone in China with your design now that people have seen the China Central Television (CCTV) building. When two huge towers were growing, jutting up and out to eventually link and become the seemingly impossible to balance CCTV headquarters, I remember them initially being joined by an enormous net. Along that net you could see Chinese workers up in the air crawling from one side to the other. It looked terrifying. There aren't exact figures on industrial accidents accompanying the speed with which the city's architectural wonders appeared, but they certainly provided a lot of jobs for once poor farmers. From building to renovating There were so many labourers in Beijing at the time sleeping in on-site dormitories that nobody knew how many millions really lived here. Last year, the city government launched a deliberate campaign to reduce what one official called the "low-end population". Entire suburbs housing the poor have been levelled and many of the small enterprises where they worked are gone. But some working class folk from outside Beijing are still holding on. In the run up to the Games, Sun Jingsu came from Hennan Province to find a better life. He is still here, next to the Bird's Nest using a trowel to spread cement across a new fence. "There's not as much construction work as there used to be," he says. "Now we're doing renovations and the like." "I don't really know," he says when I ask him about his future plans. "But I guess it must be back in the countryside." Apart from finding work, a major problem for manual labourers now is affordability. Sun Jingsu proudly tells me he earns more than 200 yuan ($29; £22) a day. It's above the average for this type of work, but it's what some people in Beijing spend on lunch. A short walk down the street, waitress Wei Xufang is selling fruit to customers. She came to Beijing from Shanxi, where she'd watched the Olympics as a 15 year old. She thinks Chinese people are as positive about the future now as they were 10 years ago. You only have to look at the city's streetscape to appreciate the Olympic legacy, she says. "Beijing is such a clean city. There are always people cleaning it." More than just sport Ordinary Chinese people, known affectionately as "lao bai xing", were supposed to get more healthy and active as a result of the Games. Mass fitness displays were featured on television and more participation in sport encouraged. But some say this hasn't really had its intended results. "You couldn't really say that the Olympics had a huge impact on say children playing sport", says junior soccer coach Yao Liwei. "The football world cup has had a much bigger impact." The ex-footballer also thinks that China has not improved its overall sporting performance since the Games. And yet Beijing's Olympics was about much more than just sport. The city had tried and failed to secure the Games in the years following the bloody 1989 Tiananmen Square clashes so it had to make certain promises in order to secure this most coveted prize. Officials said they would allow designated protest sites during the Olympics. In practice though, the Communist Party reneged on this. There were so-called "protest locations" but you needed to somehow apply for and get approval to use them. This was never going to be allowed in any meaningful way. Rules governing the foreign press were also changed, allowing correspondents to travel around without the permission of provincial Party officials. China's media remained state controlled but started to do more real reporting, like when a television crew went undercover to expose a brick kiln using children, many kidnapped, as cheap labour. However, former journalist Yuen Chan says this was still well short of some sort of golden age. "Despite all the hype about relaxed regulations for the media in the run-up to the Olympics in 2008 the authorities' grip on the domestic media was still tight," she says. The Hong Kong based ex-reporter says the reason it seems worse now is that the Chinese state has simply become better at censorship. In 2008 "it was less sophisticated and more was able to slip through the cracks," she says. "The space is far more strictly and efficiently controlled now, as we can see through the deployment of technology to boost surveillance systems at all levels". 'People watching you' The once exploding art scene here has also taken a hit from the censors since the more freewheeling period ten years ago. "Like many in China at that time I was hoping that the Chinese people might be getting a better chance to know the world and that there might be more freedom of expression," says artist Guo Jian. He returned to China after living in Australia for years, full of pre-Olympic hope for his homeland. "I thought we would be gradually moving towards a rule of law society and that we would see political reforms again; that China would embrace the world." But while his career flourished, he also saw freedom disappearing. "There was less internet freedom, there were people watching you," he says. "I was told not to do any shows which were too provocative and to not speak to the media and especially the western media." The Australian passport holder tried to make a go of it, balancing artistic expression with the need to minimise the extent to which the authorities might become upset with his work. But when he planned to cover a diorama of Tiananmen Square with rotting meat - a clear reference to the crackdown - this became too much for the officials. In 2014, Guo Jian was kicked out the country. "I was hoping that China would be moving to a better place," he says. "At a government level, I am not very optimistic about the present nor about the future. "However Chinese people are waking up. People now realise that all the dreams they gave us are just bull." 'Beijing is much prettier' Human rights groups point to the mass detention of lawyers, the establishment of vast new "re-education" camps in the western region of Xinjiang as part of a crackdown on the country's ethnic Uighur Muslims, the explosion in facial recognition surveillance available to the authorities and on and on the list goes. Yet for the majority of Chinese people none of this really touches them. Inside the Birds Nest, 80-year old Cong Ruiying is beaming. She has come to the capital from Jiangsu province with her family. These days the stadium has a nightly light show reliving the music and feeling of the Games. A visit to the Olympic zone is a must for the thousands of Chinese tourists travelling to Beijing every day. Cong Ruiyang didn't get a chance to be here in 2008 and she's excited to have finally arrived. "It's beautiful," she says as the multi-coloured lasers zoom around. I ask what she thinks of the city overall. "It's become prettier and actually much better." Does she prefer the China of today or 2008? She smiles, has a bit of a laugh and looks at me like I am some kind of nutcase to even ask such a question. "Of course it's better now," she says.
In his Christmas message the prime minister also praised the volunteers, many of them Christians, who helped to build "what I call the big society". The building of a "big society" was a key part of his 2010 election campaign, but has been rarely mentioned recently. In his message, Labour leader Ed Miliband also praised people who help others who are alone or homeless. In his message issued by 10 Downing Street, Mr Cameron said: "Christmas gives us a space when we can consider the things that we value most - family, friends and fellowship. It is a time for being hopeful for the coming year and to reflect on the one that has passed. "Looking back, 2013 has been a year when our country pulled together to overcome the challenges we face. Together we have made real progress on strengthening our economy and creating more decent jobs so that people can provide for their families. This progress is down to the efforts of millions who go out and work hard every day, putting in the hours, running businesses and keeping our economy going. "And there are those millions who keep on strengthening our society too - being good neighbours, running clubs and voluntary associations, playing their part in countless small ways to help build what I call the big society. Many of these people are Christians who live out to the letter that verse in Acts, that `it is more blessed to give than to receive'. "These people put their faith into action and we can all be grateful for what they do." Miliband's message He added that it had been a significant year for the Christian faith with a new Archbishop of Canterbury and a new Pope, both having "exciting plans to rejuvenate their respective churches, which should inspire Christians around the world". He went on: "For me, this season is also a time to think about the meaning of Christmas - the birth of Jesus Christ and the hope that gives to millions." He also praised servicemen and servicewomen "helping bring peace here and around the world; to their families who cannot be with them; and to all the dedicated men and women in the emergency and caring services who are working hard to support those in need this Christmas". In his Christmas message, Mr Miliband paid tribute to those who would be spending time caring for the lonely and the homeless. "As Christians prepare to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ, we should also take time to think of all those alone or suffering at this time of year," he said. "I would like to pay particular tribute to the many people, churches and charities who will be looking after those who are alone or homeless this Christmas time. "We should also pay tribute to those who will be working so that the rest of us have an enjoyable break, especially our medical staff, our police and our armed forces, thank you for your service."
By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent, BBC News, Yokohama, Japan Mr Kerry was responding to a major report by the UN which described the impacts of global warming as "severe, pervasive and irreversible". He said dramatic and swift action was required to tackle the threats posed by a rapidly changing climate. Our health, homes, food and safety are all likely to be threatened by rising temperatures, the report says. Scientists and officials meeting in Japan say the document is the most comprehensive assessment to date of the impacts of climate change on the world. In a statement, Mr Kerry said: "Unless we act dramatically and quickly, science tells us our climate and our way of life are literally in jeopardy. Denial of the science is malpractice. "There are those who say we can't afford to act. But waiting is truly unaffordable. The costs of inaction are catastrophic." Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which produced the report, told BBC News: "Even in rich countries, the impacts of climate change could lead to greater incidents of pockets of poverty, even in rich countries could lead to impoverishment of some particular communities. "However there is an equity issue, because some of the poorest communities in the poorest countries in the world are going to be the worst hit." Some impacts of climate change include a higher risk of flooding and changes to crop yields and water availability. Humans may be able to adapt to some of these changes, but only within limits. An example of an adaptation strategy would be the construction of sea walls and levees to protect against flooding. Another might be introducing more efficient irrigation for farmers in areas where water is scarce. Natural systems are currently bearing the brunt of climatic changes, but a growing impact on humans is feared. Members of the IPCC say it provides overwhelming evidence of the scale of these effects. The report was agreed after almost a week of intense discussions here in Yokohama, which included concerns among some authors about the tone of the evolving document. This is the second of a series from the UN's climate panel due out this year that outlines the causes, effects and solutions to global warming. This latest Summary for Policymakers document highlights the fact that the amount of scientific evidence on the impacts of warming has almost doubled since the last report in 2007. Be it the melting of glaciers or warming of permafrost, the summary highlights the fact that on all continents and across the oceans, changes in the climate have caused impacts on natural and human systems in recent decades. In the words of the report, "increasing magnitudes of warming increase the likelihood of severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts". "Nobody on this planet is going to be untouched by the impacts of climate change,'' said Mr Pachauri. Dr Saleemul Huq, a convening lead author on one of the chapters, commented: "Before this we thought we knew this was happening, but now we have overwhelming evidence that it is happening and it is real." Michel Jarraud, secretary-general of the World Meteorological Organization, said the report was based on more than 12,000 peer-reviewed scientific studies. He said this document was "the most solid evidence you can get in any scientific discipline". Ed Davey, the UK Energy and Climate Secretary said: "The science has clearly spoken. Left unchecked, climate change will impact on many aspects of our society, with far reaching consequences to human health, global food security and economic development. "The recent flooding in the UK is a testament to the devastation that climate change could bring to our daily lives." The report details significant short-term impacts on natural systems in the next 20 to 30 years. It details five reasons for concern that would likely increase as a result of the warming the world is already committed to. These include threats to unique systems such as Arctic sea ice and coral reefs, where risks are said to increase to "very high" with a 2C rise in temperatures. The summary document outlines impacts on the seas and on freshwater systems as well. The oceans will become more acidic, threatening coral and the many species that they harbour. On land, animals, plants and other species will begin to move towards higher ground or towards the poles as the mercury rises. Humans, though, are also increasingly affected as the century goes on. Food security is highlighted as an area of significant concern. Crop yields for maize, rice and wheat are all hit in the period up to 2050, with around a tenth of projections showing losses over 25%. After 2050, the risk of more severe yield impacts increases, as boom-and-bust cycles affect many regions. All the while, the demand for food from a population estimated to be around nine billion will rise. Many fish species, a critical food source for many, will also move because of warmer waters. In some parts of the tropics and in Antarctica, potential catches could decline by more than 50%. "This is a sobering assessment," said Prof Neil Adger from the University of Exeter, another IPCC author. "Going into the future, the risks only increase, and these are about people, the impacts on crops, on the availability of water and particularly, the extreme events on people's lives and livelihoods." People will be affected by flooding and heat related mortality. The report warns of new risks including the threat to those who work outside, such as farmers and construction workers. There are concerns raised over migration linked to climate change, as well as conflict and national security. Report co-author Maggie Opondo of the University of Nairobi said that in places such as Africa, climate change and extreme events mean "people are going to become more vulnerable to sinking deeper into poverty". While the poorer countries are likely to suffer more in the short term, the rich won't escape. "The rich are going to have to think about climate change. We're seeing that in the UK, with the floods we had a few months ago, and the storms we had in the US and the drought in California," said Dr Huq. "These are multibillion dollar events that the rich are going to have to pay for, and there's a limit to what they can pay." But it is not all bad news, as the co-chair of the working group that drew up the report points out. "I think the really big breakthrough in this report is the new idea of thinking about managing climate change as a problem in managing risks," said Dr Chris Field. "Climate change is really important but we have a lot of the tools for dealing effectively with it - we just need to be smart about it." There is far greater emphasis to adapting to the impacts of climate in this new summary. The problem, as ever, is who foots the bill? "It is not up to IPCC to define that," said Dr Jose Marengo, a Brazilian government official who attended the talks. "It provides the scientific basis to say this is the bill, somebody has to pay, and with the scientific grounds it is relatively easier now to go to the climate negotiations in the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and start making deals about who will pay for adaptation."

The chatter, involving top leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, represented one of the most serious plots since the 9/11 attacks, the New York Times says. The US earlier said the closures in North Africa and the Middle East were "out of an abundance of caution". Some 20 US embassies and consulates were shut on Sunday. A state department global travel alert, issued last week, is also in force until the end of August. US diplomatic posts in Abu Dhabi, Amman, Cairo, Riyadh, Dhahran, Jeddah, Doha, Dubai, Kuwait, Manama, Muscat, Sanaa and Tripoli will remain closed until Saturday. Several European countries have also temporarily shut missions in Yemen and the UK Foreign Office is advising against all travel to the country. Both the White House and the US state department said the threat came from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but refused to divulge further details, reports the BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan, in Washington. But according to the New York Times, the US intercepted communications between Zawahiri and the group's head in Yemen, Nasser al-Wuhayshi. The paper said that no targets had been singled out in the discussions, but that a possible attack appeared to be imminent. A US official told the Associated Press news agency that Zawahiri's message had been picked up several weeks ago and appeared initially targeted at Yemen. US lawmakers have said it was a huge plot in the final stages, but have offered no specifics. On Monday, a top member of the House intelligence committee Dutch Ruppersberger told CNN the warnings were not designed to frighten Americans, though he said a planned attack could be "anywhere". "Americans should live their lives... we just want them to be aware," Representative Ruppersberger said. White House spokesman Jay Carney said he could not be "specific" about the threats. He said: "Our current information suggests that al-Qaeda and affiliated organisations continue to plan terrorist attacks both in the region and beyond. And our information suggests that they may focus efforts to conduct attacks in the period between now and the end of August." Meanwhile, officials in Yemen have released the names of 25 al-Qaeda suspects, saying they had been planning attacks targeting "foreign offices and organisations and Yemeni installations" in the capital of Sanaa and other cities across the country. There was also increased security at government buildings and checkpoints in Yemen on Monday. AQAP, the Yemeni branch of al-Qaeda, has also been blamed for the foiled Christmas Day 2009 effort to bomb an airliner over Detroit and explosives-laden parcels that were intercepted the following year aboard cargo flights. Seven suspected al-Qaeda militants were killed in two US drone air strikes in southern Yemen in June, officials say.
Police said she died in her room at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where she had been staying as a guest. Houston was one of the most celebrated female singers of all time, with hits including I Will Always Love You and Saving All My Love For You. But her later career was overshadowed by substance abuse and her turbulent marriage to singer Bobby Brown. Ms Houston died on the eve of the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. She had been due to attend a pre-awards party in the Beverly Hilton Hotel organised by her long-time mentor and record industry executive Clive Davis on Saturday evening. He went ahead with the party, holding a minute's silence and telling the audience he was "personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years". Jazz legend Herbie Hancock, who was attending the event, said: "It's difficult not to be sad about it because it's a great loss. Her soul, her spirit, lives within all of us." The hotel was already teeming with reporters and celebrities when police received an emergency call from hotel security at 15.43 local time (23:43 GMT), Beverly Hills police spokesman Mark Rosen told the BBC. Police were despatched, but paramedics who were already at the hotel because of the party attempted to resuscitate her, without success. She was pronounced dead at 15:55. Mr Rosen said Ms Houston's entourage - comprising family members, friends and co-workers - had taken over much of the fourth floor of the hotel. "There were a number of people on scene who were able to positively identify Ms Houston for us," he said, adding that her next of kin have been informed of her death. Police investigators inspected the scene before Ms Houston's body was moved from the hotel to the coroner's office for an autopsy. While the cause of death is unclear, Mr Rosen said there were "no obvious signs of criminal intent". An autopsy is likely to be held within the next two days. However, if drugs or alcohol are involved, it will take between six and eight weeks for toxicology tests to be completed. The US celebrity website TMZ.com reported that Ms Houston had been partying heavily on both Thursday and Friday nights. She briefly took the microphone and performed a song while out in Hollywood on Thursday, and was seen drinking and chatting loudly with friends in the hotel bar on Friday, according to TMZ. 'Finest voice' Houston's background was steeped in soul and gospel music. Her mother was gospel singer Cissy Houston, she was cousin to singer Dionne Warwick and goddaughter to Aretha Franklin. "I just can't talk about it now," Ms Franklin said in a short statement. "It's so stunning and unbelievable. I couldn't believe what I was reading coming across the TV screen." Having grown up in New Jersey, Houston began singing in church and then in the night clubs of New York, and was a model before being signed by Arista Records. At the height of her career in the 1980s and 90s she won many awards and enjoyed several number one singles and albums. Artists from Mariah Carey to Christina Aguilera have tried to emulate her bravura performances, but none of them were as good as the original, music critic Paul Gambaccini told the BBC. Carey was one of the many singers to pay tribute to the star, saying she was "heartbroken and in tears over the shocking death of my friend". "My heartfelt condolences to Whitney's family and to all her millions of fans throughout the world. She will never be forgotten as one of the greatest voices to ever grace the earth." Houston also enjoyed success acting in blockbuster films such as The Bodyguard and Waiting to Exhale. Sony Pictures announced on Sunday that it would release the star's final film, Sparkle, which is loosely based on the story of The Supremes, in August. "Like all those who knew and loved her, we are shocked and saddened," said spokesman Steve Elzer said on behalf of the studio. "The world has lost an incomparable talent." In recent years drug use had taken its toll on the star and her voice - once acknowledged as one of the finest in pop music - was badly damaged. "She did have it all, but the record is there of the decline into drug use and the damage done from drug use," said Gambaccini. Her marriage to Brown, with whom she had a daughter, Bobbi Kristina, ended in divorce in 2007. The marriage had been a tempestuous one, with allegations of domestic abuse as well as drug addiction. "The biggest devil is me. I'm either my best friend or my worst enemy,'' Houston told ABC's Diane Sawyer in a 2002 interview. Ms Houston was strongly linked to the Grammys - having won six awards herself over the years. Organisers of Sunday's ceremony said she would be remembered in a special tribute by singer Jennifer Hudson. Civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton said that on the morning of the Grammys, "the world should pause and pray for the memory of a gifted songbird". Country singer Dolly Parton - who wrote one one of her most memorable hits, I Will Always Love You - said in a statement: "Mine is only one of the millions of hearts broken over the death of Whitney Houston." "I will always be grateful and in awe of the wonderful performance she did on my song, and I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, 'Whitney, I will always love you. You will be missed'."
In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, he said it was not until his late 20s that he processed the grief - after two years of "total chaos" and coming close to a "complete breakdown". But he was in a "good place" because of the "process I have been through". Harry, 32, also said boxing had "saved" him by helping him let out aggression. The Telegraph says Prince Harry had decided to talk about his past in the hope it would encourage people to break the stigma surrounding mental health issues. Along with his brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, he is promoting the Heads Together mental health campaign, the London Marathon's charity of the year. Speaking to the paper's Bryony Gordon, Prince Harry said: "I can safely say that losing my mum at the age of 12, and therefore shutting down all of my emotions for the last 20 years, has had a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well." He added: "I have probably been very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions when all sorts of grief and all sorts of lies and misconceptions and everything are coming to you from every angle." By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent This is a senior royal as we rarely see or hear them. Prince Harry is part of the future of an institution that once embodied the British stiff-upper-lip approach to life. Such an approach was dealt a blow by Diana, Princess of Wales. In her 1995 BBC Panorama interview, she told Martin Bashir about her post-natal depression, her self-harming and her bulimia. Now, Prince Harry is following his mother's example. In the podcast, which is a compelling listen, Harry admits to feeling nervous as he speaks openly about suffering from anxiety, coming close to a breakdown and being a "problem" for much of his 20s. Prince Harry is this country's most high profile person yet to talk about his personal mental anguish. His privileged life in a palace hasn't protected him from ill-health. Diana's son hopes that his up-front display of honesty will help to break the taboo that still surrounds mental health. Read more from Peter The Princess of Wales died in a car crash in Paris in August 1997. Prince Harry said: "My way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum, because why would that help?" "(I thought) it's only going to make you sad, it's not going to bring her back. So from an emotional side, I was like 'right, don't ever let your emotions be part of anything.'" He described himself as a "typical 20, 25, 28-year-old running around going 'life is great', or 'life is fine' and that was exactly it. "And then [I] started to have a few conversations and actually all of a sudden, all of this grief that I have never processed started to come to the forefront and I was like, there is actually a lot of stuff here that I need to deal with." He said he decided to act after his brother - the Duke of Cambridge - told him: "Look, you really need to deal with this. It is not normal to think that nothing has affected you." Prince Harry opened up to the Telegraph's Bryony Gordon over a cup of tea at Kensington Palace during a half-hour interview recorded for a podcast on mental health issues. Gordon, who has previously spoken of her own struggles with bulimia, alcoholism and an obsessive compulsive disorder, said the pair had been alone in the room. She said it had been unusual to hear a royal talk for half an hour on any subject and described Prince Harry as "really articulate and a sound guy". Prince Harry said: "Some of the best people or easiest people to speak to is a shrink or whoever - the Americans call them shrinks - someone you have never met before. "You sit down on the sofa and say 'listen, I don't actually need your advice. Can you just listen'. And you just let it all rip." 'Let out aggression' Asked whether he had counselling, he said: "I've done that a couple of times, more than a couple of times, but it's great." But he said he could "safely say" his concerns were not related to his service as a soldier in Afghanistan. On taking up boxing, Prince Harry told the paper: "Everyone was saying boxing is good for you and it's a really good way of letting out aggression. "And that really saved me because I was on the verge of punching someone." Prince Harry said: "Because of the process I have been through over the past two-and-a-half years, I've now been able to take my work seriously, been able to take my private life seriously as well, and been able to put blood, sweat and tears into the things that really make a difference and things that I think will make a difference to everybody else." A two-part series, Mind Over Marathon, starts on BBC One at 2100 BST on Thursday 20 April, as part of a Minds Matter series of programming about mental health issues.

The Ministry of Defence said the attacks were in support of Kurdish units in the north-west of the country. The strikes - by two GR4 Tornados - came four days after Parliament approved military action, and were said to be "successful". About 40 nations are targeting IS, which controls parts of Iraq and Syria. Information from Kurdish sources suggests the RAF strikes had helped the Kurds retake an "important border crossing" at Rabia near Syria, said the BBC's Clive Myrie in Irbil, northern Iraq. Heavy fighting was reported on both sides of the border between Iraq and Syria. Iraqi Kurdish troops are said to have suffered heavy casualties in recapturing Rabia, as IS fighters were trying to dislodge Syrian Kurdish forces on the other side of the border. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said both Tornados had "returned safely to their base", RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. He said they were in action in support of the Iraqi government. The MoD said the aircraft were on an "armed reconnaissance mission" when they were asked to help Kurdish troops in north-west Iraq. It said the Kurds were under attack from IS - also known as Isil and Isis. "On arriving overhead, the RAF patrol, using their Litening III targeting pod, identified an Isil heavy weapon position which was engaging Kurdish ground forces," an MoD statement said. "One Paveway IV guided bomb was used to attack the Isil position. "Following this engagement, the patrol identified an Isil armed pick-up truck in the same area and conducted an attack on the vehicle using a Brimstone missile. "An initial assessment indicates that both precision strikes were successful." Earlier, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain would not be "panicked" into dropping bombs in Iraq by reports that militants were advancing. He said the RAF would carefully target IS, as hitting civilians would have the "opposite of the effect we are intending". Meanwhile, at a fringe meeting at the Conservative conference in Birmingham, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said Tory and Lib Dem cabinet ministers were agreed that the UK would have to confront IS in Syria as well as Iraq. He said: "There was absolute unity around the cabinet table, including the Liberal Democrats as well, all basically saying the same thing - that the complete package is ultimately having to deal with Isil, not Isil in one place." On Friday, Parliament voted by 524 votes to 43 for UK air strikes against IS in Iraq.
The 37-year-old mother of six has explained her reasons for having the surgery in the New York Times. She said her doctors estimated she had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer. "I decided to be proactive and to minimise the risk as much I could," she wrote. Her partner, Brad Pitt, praised her choice as "absolutely heroic". Risk reduced Ms Jolie said the process began in February and was completed by the end of April. In an article entitled My Medical Choice, she explained that her mother fought cancer for nearly a decade and died at the age of 56. She said she had sought to reassure her children that the same illness would not take her away from them, "but the truth is I carry a 'faulty' gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer". She said that once she "knew that this was my reality", she had taken the decision to undergo the nine weeks of complex surgery required to have a double mastectomy, followed by reconstruction of the breasts with implants. "There have been many advances in this procedure in the last few years, and the results can be beautiful," she wrote. Her chances of developing breast cancer have now dropped from 87% to under 5%, she said. She praised her partner, actor Brad Pitt, for his love and support throughout the procedure, and said she was reassured that her children had found nothing in the results "that makes them uncomfortable". "I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity," she said. "For any woman reading this, I hope it helps you to know you have options," Ms Jolie went on to say. "I want to encourage every woman, especially if you have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to seek out the information and medical experts who can help you through this aspect of your life, and to make your own informed choices." In an interview with the Evening Standard, Brad Pitt said: "Having witnessed this decision firsthand, I find Angie's choice, as well as so many others like her, absolutely heroic. "All I want for is for her to have a long and healthy life, with myself and our children. This is a happy day for our family." Ms Jolie, an award-winning actress and director, is also a long-time supporter of humanitarian causes. She is currently a special envoy for the UN Refugee Agency. During the period she was undergoing the double mastectomy procedure, Ms Jolie visited the Democratic Republic of Congo with UK Foreign Secretary William Hague and attended the G8 summit of foreign ministers in London to raise awareness over sexual violence in conflict. She also helped launch a charity to fund girls' education set up by the Pakistani schoolgirl activist Malala Yousafzai, who survived being shot by the Taliban last October. Ms Jolie has three biological children and three adopted children. Risk factor Emma Parlons, a 38-year-old mother from London who had the operation three years ago, welcomed her decision to raise awareness of the issue. Ms Parlons said her risk of getting breast cancer was the same as the actress's. "If somebody said your flight across the Atlantic was 86% likely to come down, you wouldn't get on that plane would you?" she said in an explanation of her reasons for having the operation. Professor Gareth Evans, of the Manchester Breast Centre in Britain, said the two genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer one and two) "were the first two majorly breast cancer pre-disposing genes that were identified" and are also linked to an increased risk of ovarian cancer. "The risk associated with the genes isn't simply an exact figure like 87%," he told the BBC. "It does depend on other risk factors, and so the risk for someone with a BRCA1 mutation could vary anywhere between 50 and 95% for breast cancer." Currently, women facing a strong likelihood of developing breast cancer have only two real options - to have both of their breasts removed (a double mastectomy) or hope that it will never actually happen. In January, the drugs watchdog in England and Wales, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, recommended women at a high genetic risk of breast cancer should be given the option of taking the drug Tamoxifen, or another one called raloxifene, for five years to cut their lifetime risk of the disease.
In mid-December, the award-winning Australian correspondent Peter Greste arrived in Egypt's capital for a routine assignment - his first in the country. He checked into an upmarket hotel on the banks of the Nile, where al-Jazeera had a makeshift office, and started reading up on the story. Just two weeks later, the former BBC correspondent became the story. He and two of his colleagues from al-Jazeera English - Egyptian-Canadian Cairo bureau chief Mohamed Adel Fahmy and Egyptian producer Baher Mohamed - were arrested. The trio was soon branded the "Marriott Terror Cell". On Thursday, they are due to appear before a criminal court in Cairo on charges including broadcasting false news, and aiding or joining a terrorist organisation - as the Muslim Brotherhood was designated four days before their arrest - and endangering national security. If convicted, they could be sentenced to several years in jail. 'Breaking the law' Egypt denies the case is an attack on freedom of speech. It says the al-Jazeera journalists were working illegally because they did not have press passes. "We have accredited more than 1,000 correspondents from foreign organisations, and they are working freely," one official says. "If you break the law, this is not freedom of expression." Al-Jazeera is a regular target for Egypt's military-backed interim government. The channel is owned by the government of Qatar, which backs the Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt regards the network as a mouthpiece for the Islamists. But al-Jazeera's management deny allegations of bias. "The charges just don't hold water," says Heather Allan, head of newsgathering for al-Jazeera English. "Egypt is a very important story for us. We've always been there, we believe we have been very fair, and when they were picked up we thought it would last a day or two." Instead, the journalists have now spent almost two months in Cairo's Tora prison complex, a much feared high-security fortress. In a letter written from there last month, Peter Greste recounted being "locked in my cell 24 hours a day, for the past 10 days, allowed out only for questioning". His colleagues were held separately in worse conditions, according to relatives. They say Mohamed Fahmy, who entered prison with a dislocated shoulder, was forced to sleep on the floor, and is still waiting for medical treatment. All three men are now sharing a cell, and are being allowed out for only an hour's exercise a day. Their only offence, according to Peter Greste's prison letter, was "doing what any responsible journalist would - trying to make sense of the unfolding events with accuracy, fairness and balance". But trying to provide balanced coverage is a dangerous business in Egypt these days - especially if that includes reporting on the Muslim Brotherhood. The army removed it from power last July, along with President Mohammed Morsi - following mass opposition protests - and would clearly prefer it to disappear from view. Fear returns Thousands of miles away, at their home in Australia, Peter Greste's parents cannot comprehend how he and his colleagues wound up behind bars. "He's a professional journalist, of a high ethical standard," his father Juris told the BBC. "He's been there for about two weeks, just getting his bearings, all of sudden he is accused of being a terrorist. You can't punish someone just because you don't like the message." But critics say that is exactly what Egypt is doing - with scant legal justification. The three men are among a group of 20 people indicted by the authorities at the end of January. They also include the Dutch newspaper and radio correspondent, Rena Netjes, whose only connection with al-Jazeera was having a meeting with Mohamed Fahmy at the Marriott. She managed to flee Egypt, with the help of her embassy. Many journalists in Egypt say they are now working, or trying to work, in a climate of fear - among them 23-year-old Mosa'ab Elshamy. The photojournalist has been documenting the tumultuous changes here since the revolution of 2011 that toppled President Hosni Mubarak. But lately, he has been taking fewer pictures because of the risk of being jailed. "It is my biggest fear because I know it is going to take months, if not years, before getting out," he says. "We have seen how journalists in Egypt have been detained for the most absurd reasons, and they continue to spend months of their lives [in prison], and a day in prison is like no other day." Mr Elshamy has adapted by covering fewer stories and spending less time on the streets, but some of his colleagues have opted to leave the country. "The change is huge and it's tangible," he says. "The little achievements and the little freedoms that people got from the revolution have been taken away. People are back to this fear." Hunger strike For the young photographer, concerns about press freedom are acutely personal. His older brother, Abdullah, has been in prison since August. The correspondent for al-Jazeera's Arabic channel was arrested while covering the violent dispersal of a pro-Brotherhood sit-in, during which hundreds of people were killed by the security forces. At the time the authorities insisted they had to restore security. Unlike the other three al-Jazeera journalists, Abdullah Elshamy has no trial date. The 25-year-old has not even been charged. On 21 January, he began a managed hunger strike in protest - he is accepting liquids, but no solid food. "I do not belong to any group or ideology," he says in a statement posted on Facebook by his brother. "I belong to my conscience and my humanity. Nothing will break my will or my dignity." Police state 'reinvented' Campaigners say the al-Jazeera staff are among 13 foreign and locals journalists imprisoned in Egypt. The country is now ranked among the top 10 jailers of journalists in the world. The current attack on press freedom is the most severe ever, according to Gamal Eid of the Arab Network for Human Rights Information. "There is no space for the opposing view," he says, comparing the country to Iraq under Saddam Hussein, and even Germany under Adolf Hitler. The silencing of dissent goes far beyond journalists. Political scientist Amr Hamzawy is facing charges over a tweet questioning a court ruling. The university lecturer and former member of parliament has even been barred from leaving the country. "There are increasing signs of restrictions on freedom of expression for academics, for politicians and for intellectuals," he says. "We are really looking at days worse than the Mubarak days, because even under Mubarak we had opposing voices being heard every now and then, but now its being suppressed. We are witnessing the reinvention of the police state." When the case against the al-Jazeera journalists comes to court, it will be carefully watched abroad, including in the White House, which has called for the journalists to be released. Many here believe they are being tried just for telling all sides of the story. Critics say that in today's Egypt that is tantamount to a crime.
The Life in the United Kingdom test was introduced by Labour in 2005. The Sunday Times says immigrants will be told "historically the UK is a Christian country". The revised version will focus less on the practicalities of daily living in Britain and require more knowledge of British history and achievements. Inventions and discoveries The paper says immigrants will also have to learn the first verse of the national anthem before they can become UK citizens. Mrs May is understood to have scrapped sections of the test which dealt with claiming benefits and the Human Rights Act. Instead potential immigrants will be expected to learn about Byron, the Duke of Wellington, Shakespeare and other historical and cultural figures. The new version of the handbook, expected to be issued in the autumn, will include sections about key battles, such as Trafalgar, and British inventions and discoveries. A Home Office spokesperson told the BBC: "Putting our culture and history at the heart of the citizenship test will help ensure those permanently settling can understand British life allowing them to properly integrate into our society." The handbook is the basis of a 45-minute test which potential citizens can take at one of 90 centres around the UK. Sultana Razia, who came to the UK from Bangladesh five years ago, has already failed the test once in her quest to become a British citizen. "If you want to live here, you have to know all the information - all the rules and the way of living here and the culture here," she told BBC News. "The test is important, it's quite hard but it's important." Alp Mehmet, vice chairman of the Migration Watch think tank, welcomed the planned changes. "People are almost encouraged to see what they can get out of the country rather than what they can contribute," he told BBC News. "And I think that the emphasis moving towards people having an understanding of the country they're joining effectively - becoming citizens of - is absolutely right." But Habib Mirza, who runs citizenship courses at BSGS College, in Whitechapel, east London, said proposed changes would represent "a massive barrier for anybody who wants to settle down in the United Kingdom, the vast majority of whom cannot speak English anyway". "People who do speak English, who are born and brought up here, we would find it very, very difficult to pass so how will they pass?" And he said asking people from non-Christian backgrounds to learn the National Anthem "might be against their religious beliefs, it might be against their personal beliefs" and it was therefore "unfair".
The Salford taxi driver was delivering aid to Syria in December when he was kidnapped and then held hostage by IS. IS threatened to kill him in footage last month showing the death of Briton David Haines, and in this video they threaten US aid worker Peter Kassig. David Cameron said Britain would do all it could "to hunt down these murderers and bring them to justice". The prime minister said the killing of father-of-two Mr Henning, 47, showed "how barbaric and repulsive" IS was. "My thoughts and prayers tonight are with Alan's wife Barbara, their children and all those who loved him," he said. "Alan had gone to Syria to help get aid to people of all faiths in their hour of need." Mr Henning's wife Barbara had this week appealed for her husband's release, saying: "He is innocent." Volunteer Mr Henning was on his fourth aid mission to Syria when he was captured within minutes of arriving in the country last December. The prime minister will be briefed by intelligence and security chiefs on Saturday. Downing Street said the "barbarity" of the act "underlines why it is right for Britain to join in the attacks against IS", according to BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith. "It is also pointed out that ministers have known for some time the risk to Western hostages and cannot allow that to determine British foreign policy," our correspondent added. Number Ten has declined to comment on the possible use of special forces in the fight against IS. 'Generous character' IS has previously released videos showing the apparent beheading of two US journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and British aid worker Mr Haines. The video released on Friday is yet to be verified, but it appears to show Mr Henning kneeling beside a militant, who is dressed in black, in a desert setting. The footage ends with an IS fighter threatening a man they identify as Mr Kassig. In a statement, Mr Kassig's family said he had converted to Islam and referred to him as Abdul Rahman Kassig. The family asked people around the world to pray for his release and that of "all innocent people being held hostage in the Middle East and around the globe". They also asked people to pray for Mr Henning's family, adding: "We have read about his work and his generous character with great respect and admiration." Mr Henning's friend Majid Freeman described him as a "selfless, humble, courageous individual" who had simply wanted to help others. Mr Freeman, who was with him on the convoy when he was captured, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "He was helping the innocent people the rest of the world had abandoned. "It doesn't make sense to kill him." 'British accent' BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said the footage was similar to previous videos released by IS, though slightly shorter. He said it included a reference to last week's vote by UK Parliament to authorise air strikes against IS in Iraq. Like previous videos it features a militant with an apparently British accent, he added. The UK Foreign Office said in a statement: "We are aware of the video and are working urgently to verify the contents. "If true, this is a further disgusting murder. "We are offering the family every support possible; they ask to be left alone at this time." The US said it was evaluating the video and if proved real, it was "another demonstration of the brutality" of the militant group. Analysis Frank Gardner, security correspondent, BBC News David Cameron's vow to catch the jihadist killers of Alan Henning and bring them to justice would seem to match the mood of the nation. But judging by the track record of previous such cases of hostages being murdered overseas, this promise has little likelihood of being fulfilled. Tony Blair made the same pledge after Ken Bigley from Liverpool was beheaded in 2004, Gordon Brown did the same when tourist Edwin Dwyer was kidnapped and killed in the Sahara, and Mr Cameron vowed to punish those who besieged the Algerian gas plant last year. According to the Crown Prosecution Service, there has not been one single case of any murderers of British hostages ever being brought to justice in Britain. Profile: Alan Henning Henning's home town 'stunned' US President Barack Obama led widespread condemnation of the killing, calling it a "brutal murder" and saying it was a "great loss" to the Syrian people Mr Henning had been trying to help. Dr Shuja Shafi, secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain, tweeted: "Saddened by reported murder of Alan Henning. A despicable and offensive act. He helped Muslims. My thoughts and prayers with his family." Mohammed Shafiq, chief executive of the Ramadhan Foundation, said: "This barbaric killing is an attack against all decent people around the world." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg offered his "sincere condolences" to the Henning family and said of IS: "We are resolved to defeat this evil." Labour leader Ed Miliband called the killing "appalling and barbaric". Earlier this week Mrs Henning had asked for "mercy" for her husband, saying his family was continuing their attempts to communicate with the group. She also said she had received an audio message of her husband pleading for his life. Mrs Henning had said some people thought her husband was in the wrong place at the wrong time, but she said: "He was in the right place doing the right thing." Earlier on Friday, the father of another hostage, British journalist John Cantlie, appealed for him to be released "to those he loves and who love him". The journalist, who was kidnapped in Syria in 2012, has so far appeared in three videos in which he has delivered scripted messages responding to military attacks on IS. RAF Tornados first hit IS targets on Tuesday, four days after Parliament authorised UK involvement in the military campaign. The aircraft have been conducting daily flights over Iraq, and carrying out air strikes against vehicles and weapons positions to assist Kurdish ground forces. The UK is among the nations that have joined forces to tackle the militant group, which has seized large parts of Iraq and Syria. IS has declared a so-called caliphate in the areas it has taken.
By David GrossmanUS correspondent, BBC Newsnight So what does the United States want from China - and what is the US endgame? The short answer is the phase-one trade deal that President Trump and the Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He shook hands on in the Oval office last month. But tensions between the two countries go far deeper than just trade, and no one I've spoken to in Washington thinks that this outline deal will make much difference on its own. There has been a pronounced negative shift in attitudes to China in the US in recent years, and it's important to realise that this shift predates Mr Trump's arrival in the White House. "I think if you'd seen a Hillary Clinton presidency, or another Democrat or another Republican in 2016, you would have seen this sharp turn," says Daniel Kliman, a former senior adviser at the US defence department. "There was a sense that our approach to China wasn't working," says Dr Kliman, now director of the Asia-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS). There are many reasons for this rise in tensions. The promised economic benefits of China joining the World Trade Organisation in 2001 never materialised, says Ray Bowen, who worked for the US government as an economic analyst from 2001 until 2018. China never intended to play by the rules, he says. "It's more the case that China intended to join multilateral fora in order to begin to shift how multinational fora regulate global trade." In other words, China joined intending to change rather than be changed. The result was a vast wave of job losses and factory closures in the US known as the "China shock". The so-called "rust belt states" that voted for President Trump in 2016 bore the brunt. Many US companies moved production to China to take advantage of lower labour costs. However, according to Daniel Kliman there was a high price for companies moving to China: "China has forced them to hand over their technology, their intellectual property," he says. And, even those companies that didn't relocate production found that China somehow got hold of their trade secrets. Law enforcement agencies in the US have a long list of charges against Chinese individuals and companies for spying and computer hacking. The FBI's director, Christopher Wray, recently told US Congress that there are currently at least 1,000 current investigations into the theft of intellectual property from American firms that lead back to China. The US government has estimated that the total value of intellectual property stolen by China in the four years to 2017 alone to be $1.2tn (£936bn). According to Dean Cheng of the Heritage Foundation, a US conservative think tank, this is the primary reason relations between the US and China have soured. "When companies are finding out that their patents are being rifled through, when their product is being reverse engineered, when their R&D processes are being hijacked, more and more companies concluded that partnering with China was not turning out to be profitable, and could actually be downright negative," he says. From inside government, economic analyst Ray Bowen says he noticed the mood change in late 2015. People who had previously advocated engagement with China were now alarmed to see how fast China was catching up. Rivals is a season of in-depth coverage on BBC News about the contest for supremacy between the US and China across trade, tech, defence and soft power. Read more Rivals features At the same time in the Pentagon, Brig Gen Robert Spalding was leading a team of people trying to formulate a new national security strategy to deal with China's rise and influence. He has since left the military, and has written a book called "Stealth War, How China Took Over While America's Elite Slept". When asked about the threat that China poses to US interests, Gen Spalding's reply is stark. "It's the most consequential existential threat since the Nazi party in World War Two. "I think it's a far greater threat than the Soviet Union ever was. As the number two economy in the world, its reach, particularly into the governments and in all the institutions of the West, far exceeds what the Soviets could ever manage." The result of Gen Spalding's work at the Pentagon was the National Security Strategy, published in December 2017. It's regarded as the lead document within government, designed to guide every department, and represents a profound shift in approach according to Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "There has now been a movement away from the war on terror, and instead, competition among major powers has taken the place of terrorism as the major threat to the United States," she says. The US defence department now believes that addressing the rise of China is one of the major military objectives of the United States in the coming decades. The speed with which China built, and then militarised, a string of artificial islands in the South China Sea in defiance of international law has alarmed many in Washington. According to Dean Cheng, $5.3tn of trade passes through the area every year. "China's actions were in a sense an attempt to be able to cut the carotid artery of global trade," he says. China has been very clear in its ambitions to lead the world in the important technologies of the future, like robotics and AI. "This is very core to the competition now," says Bonnie Glaser, "because if China were to succeed in these areas, then it probably would supplant the United States as the leading power in the world." That is what is now at stake. America's military supremacy is based not on a huge standing army, but on high-tech weapons systems. If China takes the lead in these crucial technologies, then the US may not be able to keep up for long. Daniel Kliman believes that the non-military technological race is also crucial. "Not only is China perfecting technologies for surveillance and censorship at home, but increasingly exporting these technologies as well as finance and knowhow abroad." He believes the battle with what he calls "high tech authoritarianism" is one that will become more and more central to the conversation about China. So, don't expect the US position on China to change in the near term, even if President Trump loses the coming election. The mood in Washington has changed. The only real political conversation is not about whether to take on China but how best to do it. Many Democrats prefer engaging with allies against President Trump's unilateral approach. However, most Democrats know there are few votes to be had by advocating a softer China policy. Rivals - America's Endgame, will be broadcast on BBC World News on Sat 9 November at 07:30 and 19:30 GMT and Sun 10 November at 11:30 and 16:30 GMT. It will be available to UK viewers on iPlayer from 17 November.
By Chris BaraniukTechnology reporter In March, it was reported that a Lithuanian man had been charged over an email phishing attack against "two US-based internet companies" that were not named at the time. They had allegedly been tricked into wiring more than $100m to the alleged scammer's bank accounts. On 27 April, Fortune reported that the two victims were Facebook and Google. The man accused of being behind the scam, Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, allegedly posed as an Asia-based manufacturer and deceived the companies from at least 2013 until 2015. "Fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multimillion-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company," the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said in March. These emails purported to be from employees of the Asia-based firm, the DOJ alleged, and were sent from email accounts designed to look like they had come from the company, but in fact had not. The DOJ also accused Mr Rimasauskas of forging invoices, contracts and letters "that falsely appeared to have been executed and signed by executives and agents of the victim companies". "We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities," a spokeswoman for Google said in a statement. "We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved." However, the firm did not reveal how much money it had transferred and recouped. Nor did Facebook - but a spokeswoman said: "Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation." Big firms targeted "Sometimes staff [at large firms] think that they are defended, that security isn't part of their job," said James Maude at cyber-security firm Avecto, commenting on the phishing threat facing big companies. "But people are part of the best security you can have - that's why you have to train them." He also told the BBC that Avecto's clients have recounted phishing attempts that used senior staff's hacked email accounts to convince employees that a request to wire out money was genuine. The sophistication of phishing scams has increased lately, according to a recent Europol report. "CEO fraud" - in which executives are impersonated by the scammer - was a particular worry. "The request is usually time-sensitive and often coincides with the close of business hours to make verification of the request difficult," the report explained. "Such attacks often take advantage of publicly reported events such as mergers, where there may be some degree of internal flux and uncertainty." In order to avoid succumbing to such fraud, firms are advised to carefully verify new payment requests before authorising them.
The Jamaican artist who created the installation claims to have been the first person to reveal Banksy's identity, by photographing him in 2004. Peter Dean Rickards bought the wall which featured the mural from a bar in Kingston and intentionally smashed it. The exhibition, at the New Art Exchange, celebrates 50 years of Jamaican independence. Curator of the exhibition Rachael Barrett said: "Most Jamaican people didn't really understand why it [the mural] would be a valuable work of art. "The artist, Peter Dean [Rickards], is questioning this fake sense of value and obsession with celebrity we've got." The mural was a version of Banksy's Balloon Girl. Mr Rickards paid about £1,500 for the wall "in cash and rum", Ms Barrett said. Banksy is thought to have painted it in Jamaica's capital in 2004. Secret identity Mr Rickards claims to have photographed Banksy at work while he was in Kingston. In 2008 the Mail on Sunday claimed to have worked out Banksy's identity from one of the photos, and named him as former public school pupil Robin Gunningham. Also in 2008, it was reported that Mr Rickards had allowed a dog to defecate on the artwork after he bought the wall. A video of him removing the mural plays on loop alongside the installation in Nottingham. The smashed wall is displayed in the corner of a room, which has been made to look like the garage in which it was stored for several years after being cut down. Mr Rickards is quoted in the exhibition notes as saying: "That was done by a guy in the UK named Banksy. "The white people love him there and he sells stuff like that for thousands of pounds. Lets cut it down!" The exhibition, called I Is AnOther, is on until 8 December.
Health authorities in France said 26 infants in the country have become sick since early December. The recall affects products and exports to countries including Britain, China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sudan. It covers hundreds of baby milk powder products marketed globally under the Milumel, Picot and Celi brands. Lactalis is one of the world's biggest dairy producers. Company spokesman Michel Nalet told AFP "nearly 7,000 tonnes" of production may have been contaminated, but the company is currently unable to say how much remains on the market, has been consumed or is in stock. Lactalis believes the salmonella outbreak can be traced to a tower used to dry out the milk powder at its factory in the town of Craon in northwest France, according to AFP. All products made there since mid-February have been recalled and the company said precautionary measures have been taken to disinfect all of its machinery at the factory. The recall expands a health scare that started at the beginning of December after 20 children in France under the age of six fell sick. At the time a limited recall was issued but regulators found the measures Lactalis had put in place to manage the contamination risk were "not sufficient". Salmonella bacteria can cause food poisoning and symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and vomiting. The illness, caused by intestinal bacteria from farm animals, is dangerous for the very young and elderly because of the risk of dehydration. It is not the first time the baby milk formula industry has been rocked by a health scare. Six babies died and around 300,000 others fell ill in 2008 after Chinese manufacturers added the industrial chemical melamine to their infant milk powder products.
Exports, a key driver of expansion, rose 14.1% in December from a year earlier. Most analysts had forecast a figure closer to 4%. Imports also rose, climbing 6% and indicating stronger domestic demand. There have been worries about the state of China's economy after growth fell to a three-year low. "The export data especially is very good news as it shows that external demand for Chinese products is picking up," Dariusz Kowalczyk, a senior economist at Credit Agricole-CIB in Hong Kong, told the BBC. "A slowdown in global demand had been one of the biggest concerns for China, and this does help alleviate some of those fears." 'Regained momentum' China's slowdown, which saw growth decline to 7.4% in the July-September quarter, has hurt various sectors of the economy. However, in recent weeks China has released a string of encouraging economic data which showed that a pick up in November continued into December. Manufacturing activity in China expanded for a third month in a row in December. At the same time, the country's services sector, which includes construction and accounts for nearly 43% of China's overall economy, expanded at its fastest pace in four months in December. Industrial production, retail sales and fixed-asset investment were all up in November, while new home prices rose in 53 out of 70 major cities in China in November, from the previous month. That was up from 35 cities which recorded price rises in October. Credit Agricole-CIB's Mr Kowalcyzk said these numbers coupled with the latest data "confirm that the Chinese economy has regained momentum". Growth hurdles However, despite the optimism and indications of a rebound, China still faces potential hurdles that could derail its recovery, not least from ongoing issues surrounding its key trading partners. The eurozone, one of its biggest export markets, is still grappling with a debt crisis with no long term solution in sight. The crisis has hurt consumer sentiment in the region and dented demand for Asian exports. Meanwhile, the economic recovery in the US, the world's biggest economy and another key export market, continues to be fragile. Analysts said that given these issues China's export growth may slow in the coming months. "If you look at the fundamentals of the US and Europe, this could be a temporary rise," said Ma Xiaoping, an economist at HSBC in Beijing. To make matters more complicated, Beijing is involved in a territorial dispute with Japan, and it has started to hurt bi-lateral trade between the two. The dispute is yet to be resolved and some even fear that it may flare up again in the coming months. There are concerns that if the situation in any of these key markets deteriorates, then it may slow China's growth. "The momentum may be lost if any of these issue spirals into a bigger problem," said Mr Kowalcyzk of Credit Agricole-CIB.
The trials will take place in California and Arizona, according to Waymo chief executive John Krafcik. Modified Chrysler Pacificas with Waymo-designed sensors were on display at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, where Mr Krafcik spoke. One tech analyst said the industry would keenly watch Waymo's performance in the coming months. Waymo plans to develop self-driving technology and provide it to established carmakers. The company was formally launched by Google in December. Mr Krafcik said the company had managed to reduce the cost of producing its Lidar laser-based sensor, though did not give details about how, according to Associated Press. He added that he expected Waymo to have completed three million miles of test-driving by May. "The Waymo self-driving program is the first true end-to-end integrated solution that we see in the market today," said Arunprasad Nandakumar, a tech analyst with Frost & Sullivan. "In the coming months, the Waymo minivan will give clearer indications on whether the industry will be able to meet the steep targets that have been publicly announced by various players." Ford, for example, is developing vehicles with similar on-board technology and has said it will have fully autonomous vehicles on the road by 2021.
The Overseas Development Institute said one in three people worldwide was now overweight and urged governments to do more to influence diets. In the UK, 64% of adults are classed as being overweight or obese. The report predicts a "huge increase" in heart attacks, strokes and diabetes. Globally, the percentage of adults who were overweight or obese - classed as having a body mass index greater than 25 - grew from 23% to 34% between 1980 and 2008. The majority of this increase was seen in the developing world, particularly in countries where incomes were rising, such as Egypt and Mexico. The ODI's Future Diets report says this is due to changing diets and a shift from eating cereals and grains to the consumption of more fats, sugar, oils and animal products. A total of 904 million people in developing countries are now classed as overweight or above, with a BMI of more than 25, up from 250 million in 1980. This compares to 557 million in high-income countries. Over the same period, the global population nearly doubled. At the same time, however, under-nourishment is still recognised to be a problem for hundreds of millions of people in the developing world, particularly children. Using data published in Population Health Metrics last year, the researchers looked at changing overweight and obesity rates across the regions of the world and by individual country. The regions of North Africa, the Middle East and Latin America saw large increases in overweight and obesity rates to a level on a par with Europe, around 58%. While North America still has the highest percentage of overweight adults at 70%, regions such as Australasia and southern Latin America are now not far behind with 63%. Diet linked to income The greatest growth in overweight people occurred in south east Asia, where the percentage tripled from a lower starting point of 7% to 22%. Among individual countries, the report found that overweight and obesity rates had almost doubled in China and Mexico, and risen by a third in South Africa since 1980. Many countries in the Middle East also had a high percentage of overweight adults. One of the report authors, Steve Wiggins, said there were likely to be multiple reasons for the increases. "People with higher incomes have the ability to choose the kind of foods they want. Changes in lifestyle, the increasing availability of processed foods, advertising, media influences... have all led to dietary changes." He said this was particularly the case in emerging economies, where a large middle class of people with rising incomes was living in urban centres and not taking much physical exercise. The result, he says, is "an explosion in overweight and obesity in the past 30 years" which could lead to serious health implications. This is because consumption of fat, salt and sugar, which has increased globally according to the United Nations, is a significant factor in cardiovascular disease, diabetes and some cancers. The world's top sugar consumers include the United States, Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Costa Rica, and Mexico. To combat the rising tide of obesity, Mr Wiggins recommends more concerted public health measures from governments, similar to those taken to limit smoking in developed countries. He said: "Politicians need to be less shy about trying to influence what food ends up on our plates. "The challenge is to make healthy diets viable whilst reducing the appeal of foods which carry a less certain nutritional value." The report cites the example of South Korea where efforts to preserve the country's traditional diet have included public campaigns and large-scale meal preparation training for women. Alan Dangour, a reader in food and nutritional global health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said urbanisation in many parts of the world had changed people's eating habits away from traditional, healthy diets. But he said obesity and under-nutrition often existed side by side, sometimes in the same household. "We need to act urgently to deal with the scandal of millions of cases of extreme hunger and under-nutrition in children, but we also need to think what happens if we provide lots of extra calories, containing few vitamins, and encourage excess consumption. "Clever, joined-up policies are needed." A spokesperson from the Department of Health said they recognised that high rates of obesity caused dangerous health conditions and were taking action. "We are already taking the lead in helping tackle and prevent this challenge, including through the government's Responsibility Deal with industry, NHS Health Checks, the National Child Measurement Programme in schools and through Change4Life. "For the first time ever, we've given local authorities ring-fenced budgets to tackle public health issues in their local area, including obesity." The Department of Health also said that industry and health professionals had a role to play in helping people improve their diet and lifestyles.
By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website Research in more than 1,000 people has identified a set of proteins in the blood which can predict the start of the dementia with 87% accuracy. The findings, published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, will be used to improve trials for new dementia drugs. Experts warned that the test was not yet ready for doctors' surgeries. Research into treatments for Alzheimer's disease has been plagued by failure. Between 2002 and 2012, 99.6% of trials aimed at preventing or reversing the disease flopped. Doctors believe the failure is down to treating patients when it is already too late, since symptoms appear around a decade after the start of the disease. Identifying patients earlier is one of the priorities for dementia research. Dementia across the globe Blood test The research group, which combines university and industry scientists, looked for differences in the blood of 452 healthy people, 220 with mild cognitive impairment and 476 with Alzheimer's disease. They were able to tell with 87% accuracy which patients with mild cognitive impairment would go on to develop Alzheimer's disease in the next year. "We want to be able to identify people to enter clinical trials earlier than they currently do and that's really what we've been aiming at," said lead researcher Prof Simon Lovestone from the University of Oxford. However, he said it may find a place in doctors' surgeries in the future. "As long as there is no treatment one can question the value of a test, but people come to the clinic because they want to know what's happening to them and I currently can't tell them." He said he was forced to tell patients to come back in a year and see if their memory problems were any worse. Prof Lovestone added: "That's grim, it's horrible, you can only imagine what that's like for patients. "Although I have some real reservations about doing a test, all I can say is there are some people who come to clinics asking precisely that question." Dr Ian Pike, chief operating officer at Proteome Sciences, said: "Having a protein test is really a major step forwards. "[It] will take several years and need many more patients before we can be certain these tests are suitable for routine clinical use, that process can start fairly quickly now." Dr Eric Karran, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, described the study as a "technical tour de force". However, he warned the current accuracy levels risked telling healthy people they were on course to develop Alzheimer's which may lead to anxiety and depression. It is unlikely that the test would be used in isolation if it eventually makes its way into clinics. A positive result could be backed up by brain scans or testing spinal fluid for signs of Alzheimer's. However, Dr Karran did argue this was a step towards making Alzheimer's a preventable disease. "I think it does, but not immediately. "This gives a better way to identify people who will progress to Alzheimer's disease, people who can be entered into clinical trials earlier, I think that will increase the potential of a positive drug effect and thereby I think we will get to a therapy, which will be an absolute breakthrough if we can get there. "It's not a simple journey. We all wish it was."
Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter Public services and safety will be carefully managed though data, while devices in our homes will talk to each other and the wider world as part of the "internet-of-things". Many of these services will be delivered over what is called 5G. It will be much more than just faster data on our phones, but potentially transformational for our lives - if you believe the hype. But there is a darker fear as well. What if it is also transformational for our security if we end up reliant on a Chinese company to deliver this future? That question risks causing a major divide in the Five Eyes - the intelligence alliance between the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The US is campaigning hard among allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from delivering 5G. "We have serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere," Bill Evanina, head of America's National Counterintelligence and Security Center has said. "Chinese company relationships with the Chinese government aren't like private sector company relationships with governments in the West." 'Rigorous oversight' Huawei has always denied being controlled by the Chinese government, or that its work poses any risks of espionage and sabotage. Its founder repeated these assertions in a recent interview with the BBC. But Australia and New Zealand have sounded negative about Huawei's involvement in their 5G networks to varying degrees, and Canada is still deciding. All eyes are now on the UK. In a speech in Brussels on Wednesday, Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, set out the framework for considering the security of 5G based on its experience so far of working with the company. The current oversight regime was "arguably the toughest and most rigorous" in the world for Huawei, he said. His officials say they have found ''poor security and engineering" by the company, but the indications are still that the UK may work with Huawei on 5G. If that is the decision then other countries - not only in the Five Eyes but also the EU and Nato - may well be tempted to follow, using the UK as a reference point because of its track record of scrutiny. There could be consequences, former officials warn. "Worries about the security of UK networks following their exposure to Huawei may make the Five Eyes partners, and perhaps others such as France, Germany or Japan, less inclined to co-operate with the UK in the future," Charles Parton, a former British diplomat, argues in a new paper for the think tank Rusi. "The maintenance of a 'Five Eyes standard' of cyber-security in telecommunications is a vital strategic and security interest, the loss of which would go far beyond a reduction in intelligence reports exchanged, and might lead to the UK being excluded from work on developing future technologies for intelligence collection." 'Resilience is key' The UK's special relationship with Huawei came about in the early 2000s, when BT was upgrading its networks and the Chinese firm came in much cheaper than the alternatives - by hundreds of millions of pounds. BT told the government it planned to use the company unless the government was willing to compensate it. Even though Huawei was kept out of the core of the network and sensitive systems, concerns over security and the growing use of Huawei by other companies led - a few years later - to the creation of a "cell" to evaluate the security of Huawei products coming into the UK. The cell's last oversight report downgraded the assurance about mitigating the risks associated with Huawei, because of serious problems with security and engineering processes. However, Mr Martin said in his speech, the report said that these were not indicators of hostile activity by China, . The company says it will invest money to deal with these concerns in the coming years, although UK officials say that so far they have not seen "a credible plan". Despite that, the indications are that the UK wants to hold out against US pressure and continue to work with the company on 5G. A decision is expected in the next two months by ministers who will need to balance security with costs and the risks to wider relationships. "Resilience is key," Mr Martin said in Brussels. "There must be sustainable diversity in the supplier market." That was one signal that even though the UK may work with Huawei, it is cautious about ending up with one dominant player on whom it is dependent. But critics fear that Huawei - possibly with Chinese state backing - is working its way into a dominant position in the long term, particularly by penetrating markets in the developing world and by setting standards for 5G. One of the biggest challenges with 5G is cost. Significant cost In many countries, telecoms companies paid much more for the 5G spectrum than they had expected. They are now looking at the sums and indicating their strong preference for the cheapest vendor - Huawei. Telecoms operators in the UK say the way in which 5G can work in a highly integrated system alongside 4G means that excluding Huawei is not realistic without significant cost and delay, including potentially removing existing hardware, leading to the UK falling behind. Breaking the ties with the company could also have significant consequences for the UK-China relationship which poses challenges with Brexit approaching. But the question will be how the US and the Trump administration reacts if the UK does not follow its line - especially if other countries use the UK as cover to follow and work with Huawei. This at a time when the UK may be looking for a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. It potentially leaves the UK between a rock and a hard place and is one more reason why the Huawei decision is placing strain on the historically close Five Eyes intelligence relationship.
Ms Begum, now 20, was one of three schoolgirls who left London to join the Islamic State group in Syria in 2015. Her citizenship was revoked by the Home Office on security grounds after she was found in a refugee camp in 2019. The Court of Appeal said she had been denied a fair hearing because she could not make her case from the Syrian camp. The Home Office said the decision was "very disappointing" and it would "apply for permission to appeal". The ruling means the government must now find a way to allow the 20-year-old, who is currently in Camp Roj in northern Syria, to appear in court in London despite repeatedly saying it would not assist removing her from Syria. Lord Justice Flaux - sitting with Lady Justice King and Lord Justice Singh - said: "Fairness and justice must, on the facts of this case, outweigh the national security concerns, so that the leave to enter appeals should be allowed." The judge also said that the national security concerns about her "could be addressed and managed if she returns to the United Kingdom". Former Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who made the decision to strip Ms Begum of her citizenship in February 2019, tweeted a statement saying he was "deeply concerned about the judgement". He said that regardless of the outcome of her case, if Ms Begum came to the UK "it will prove impossible to subsequently remove her". Begum 'not afraid of facing justice' Daniel Furner, Ms Begum's solicitor, said: "Ms Begum has never had a fair opportunity to give her side of the story. "She is not afraid of facing British justice, she welcomes it. But the stripping of her citizenship without a chance to clear her name is not justice, it is the opposite." Her father Ahmed Ali told the BBC he was "delighted" by the ruling, adding that he hoped his daughter would get "justice". The prime minister's official spokesman said that while the government "doesn't routinely comment on individual cases", the decisions it made about Ms Begum had not been "taken lightly". He said the government would "always ensure the safety and security of the UK and will not allow anything to jeopardise this". Shamima Begum is not yet packing her bags to return to the UK - there's no government plane warming up the engines at a military airfield to bring the young Eastender home. But the Court of Appeal could not have been clearer in its wording - she needs to be allowed back to make her case in the interests of justice. This is an unprecedented ruling - and the government has a matter of weeks to convince the Supreme Court to look at it again. If it stands, it could have major implications for the UK's policy of excluding some British-born IS supporters by depriving them of nationality once they're out of the UK. Scores of these people - all deemed a threat to national security - could seek to return to the UK as they fight their case to get back their British citizenship. Other governments have voluntarily repatriated these fighters and sought to contain their threat through prosecutions, monitoring and intensive deradicalisation. The UK has so far refused to do the same. Ms Begum's legal team challenged the move on three grounds - that it was unlawful because it left her stateless; it exposed her to a real risk of death or inhuman and degrading treatment; and she could not effectively challenge the decision while she was barred from returning to the UK. Under international law, it is only legal to revoke someone's citizenship if an individual is entitled to citizenship of another country. In February, a specialist tribunal - the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) - ruled that the decision to remove Ms Begum's citizenship was lawful because she was "a citizen of Bangladesh by descent". She is understood to have a claim to Bangladeshi nationality through her mother. SIAC, a semi-secret court which hears national security cases, also said that although there were concerns about how Ms Begum could take part in the proceedings in London, those difficulties did not mean the home secretary's decision should be overturned. In his ruling on Thursday, Lord Justice Flaux said: "It is difficult to conceive of any case where a court or tribunal has said we cannot hold a fair trial, but we are going to go on anyway." Government 'shirked' responsibilities Human rights organisation Liberty, which intervened in Ms Begum's appeal, welcomed the ruling, saying the right to a fair trial was "a fundamental part of our justice system and equal access to justice must apply to everyone". Liberty lawyer Katie Lines added: "Banishing someone is the act of a government shirking its responsibilities and it is critical that cruel and irresponsible government decisions can be properly challenged and overturned." Ms Begum left Bethnal Green, in east London, aged 15 for Syria in February 2015, with two school friends. Within days she had crossed the Turkish border and eventually reached the IS headquarters at Raqqa, where she married a Dutch convert recruit. They had three children - all of whom have since died.
By John SudworthBBC News, Beijing The message taking shape on the sloping concrete embankment was to a dead doctor. "Goodbye Li Wenliang!" it read, with the author using their own body to make the imprint of that final exclamation mark. Five weeks earlier, Dr Li had been punished by the police for trying to warn colleagues about the dangers of a strange new virus infecting patients in his hospital in the Chinese city of Wuhan. Now he'd succumbed to the illness himself and pictures of that frozen tribute spread fast on the Chinese internet, capturing in physical form a deep moment of national shock and anger. There's still a great deal we don't know about Covid-19, to give the disease caused by the virus its official name. Before it took its final fatal leap across the species barrier to infect its first human, it is likely to have been lurking inside the biochemistry of an - as yet unidentified - animal. That animal, probably infected after the virus made an earlier zoological jump from a bat, is thought to have been kept in a Wuhan market, where wildlife was traded illegally. Beyond that, the scientists trying to map its deadly trajectory from origin to epidemic can say little more with any certainty. But while they continue their urgent, vital work to determine the speed at which it spreads and the risks it poses, one thing is beyond doubt. A month or so on from its discovery, Covid-19 has shaken Chinese society and politics to the core. That tiny piece of genetic material, measured in ten-thousandths of a millimetre, has set in train a humanitarian and economic catastrophe counted in more than 1,000 Chinese lives and tens of billions of Chinese yuan. It has closed off whole cities, placing an estimated 70 million residents in effective quarantine, shutting down transport links and restricting their ability to leave their homes. And it has exposed the limits of a political system for which social control is the highest value, breaching the rigid layers of censorship with a tsunami of grief and rage. The risk for the ruling elite is obvious. It can be seen in their response, ordering into action the military, the media and every level of government from the very top to the lowliest village committee. The consequences are now entirely dependent on questions no one knows the answers to; can they pull off the complex task of bringing a runaway epidemic under control, and if so, how long might it take? Across the world, people seem unsure how to respond to the small number of cases being detected in their own countries. The public mood can swing between panic - driven by the pictures of medical workers in hazmat suits - to complacency, brought on by headlines that suggest the risk is no worse than flu. The evidence from China suggests that both responses are misguided. Seasonal flu may well have a low fatality rate, measured in fractions of 1%, but it's a problem because it affects so many people around the world. The tiny proportion killed out of the many, many millions who catch it each year still numbers in the hundreds of thousands - individually tragic, collectively a major healthcare burden. Very early estimates suggested the new virus may be at least as deadly as flu - precisely why so much effort is now going into stopping it becoming another global pandemic. But one new estimate suggests it could prove even deadlier yet, killing as many as 1% of those who contract it. For any individual, that risk is still relatively small, although it's worth noting such estimates are averages - just like flu, the risks fall more heavily on the elderly and already infirm. But China's experience of this epidemic demonstrates two things. Firstly, it offers a terrifying glimpse of the potential effect on a healthcare system when you scale up infections of this kind of virus across massive populations. Two new hospitals have had to be built in Wuhan in a matter of days, with beds for 2,600 patients, and giant stadiums and hotels are being used as quarantine centres, for almost 10,000 more. Despite these efforts, many have still struggled to find treatment, with reports of people dying at home, unregistered in the official figures. Secondly, it highlights the importance of taking the task of containing outbreaks of new viruses extremely seriously. The best approach, most experts agree, is one based on transparency and trust, with good public information and proportionate, timely government action. But in an authoritarian system, with strict censorship and an emphasis on political stability above all else, transparency and trust are in short supply. China's response may have sometimes looked like panic - with what's been called the "biggest quarantine in history" and harsh enforcement against those who disobey. But those measures have become necessary only because its initial response looked like the very definition of complacency. There's ample evidence that the warning signs were missed by the authorities, and worse, ignored. By late December, medical staff in Wuhan were beginning to notice unusual symptoms of viral pneumonia, with a cluster linked to the market trading in illegal wildlife. On 30 December, Dr Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist working in Wuhan's Central Hospital, posted his concerns in a private medical chat group, advising colleagues to take measures to protect themselves. He'd seen seven patients who appeared to be suffering with an illness similar to Sars - another coronavirus that began in an illegal Chinese wildlife market in 2002 and went on to kill 774 people worldwide. A few days later, he was summoned by the police. Dr Li was made to sign a confession, denouncing the messages he'd posted as "illegal behaviour". The case received national media attention, with a high-profile state-run TV report announcing that in total, eight people in Wuhan were being investigated for "spreading rumours". The authorities, though, were well aware of the outbreak of illness. The day after Dr Li posted his message, China notified the World Health Organization, and the day after that, the suspected source - the market - was closed down. But despite the multiplying cases and the concerns among medics that human-to-human transmission was taking place, the authorities did little to protect the public. Doctors were already setting up quarantine rooms and anticipating extra admissions when Wuhan held its important annual political gathering, the city's People's Congress. In their speeches, the Communist Party leaders made no mention of the virus. China's National Health Commission continued to report that the number of infections was limited and that there was no clear evidence that the disease could spread between humans. And on 18 January the Wuhan authorities allowed a massive community banquet to take place, involving more than 40,000 families. The aim was to set a record for the most dishes served at an event. Two days later, China finally confirmed that human-to-human transmission was indeed taking place. Most remarkable of all perhaps, the following day, Wuhan held a Lunar New Year dance performance, attended by senior officials from across the surrounding province of Hubei. A state media report of the event, since hurriedly deleted but captured here, says the performers, some with runny noses and feeling unwell, "overcame the fear of pneumonia... winning praise from the leaders". By the time the national authorities had woken up to the impending disaster, and closed the city down on 23 January, it was too late - the epidemic was out of control. Before Wuhan's transport links were cut, an estimated five million people had left the city for the Lunar New Year break, travelling across China and the world. Some have begun calling the disaster "China's Chernobyl". The parallels in failures to pass bad news up the chain of command and the incentives to put the short-term interests of political stability ahead of public safety, seem all too apparent. Li Wenliang, who'd gone back to work after being warned to keep quiet, soon discovered he'd also been infected. He died earlier this month, leaving a five-year-old son and a pregnant wife. Anger was already simmering over the authorities' failure to issue timely warnings, with the crisis now being aired in full view. Wuhan's politicians were blaming senior officials for failing to authorise the release of the information; senior officials appeared to be preparing to hang Wuhan's politicians out to dry. But the death of a man, silenced for simply trying to protect his colleagues, burst open the dam with a wave of online fury directed not just at individuals, but at the system itself. So great was the public outrage, China's censors appeared unsure what to censor and what to let through. The hashtag #Iwantfreedomofspeech was viewed almost two million times before it was blocked. Aware of the tide of emotion, the Party began paying its own tributes to Dr Li. It quickly hailed him a national hero. China's rulers, untroubled by the inconveniences of the ballot box, have far deeper and older fears of what might sweep them from office. The wars, famines and diseases that shook the dynasties of old have given them their inheritance; an acute historical sense of the danger of the unforeseen crisis. They will also know well what Chernobyl did for the legitimacy of the ruling Communist Party in the former USSR. "It's impossible to know if Li Wenliang's death will serve as the catalyst for something bigger," Jude Blanchette, an expert on Chinese politics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, tells me. "But the raw emotion that surged when news of his condition broke indicates deep levels of frustration and anger exist within the country." Precisely because it feels the weight of history, however, the Communist Party has made holding onto power a living obsession, and it has an ever more formidable domestic security apparatus to help it to do so. Over the past few decades it has proven nothing if not resilient, enduring through political chaos, devastating earthquakes and man-made disasters. But one sign that might hint at an awareness of just how great the current risks are comes in the role being played by China's President Xi Jinping. This week - for the first time since the crisis began - he ventured out to meet health workers involved in the fight, visiting a hospital and a virus control centre in Beijing. In contrast, his premier, Li Keqiang, has been sent to the front lines in Wuhan and appointed head of a special working group to tackle the epidemic. While it is common for the premier to be the face of reassurance during national disasters, some observers see another reason why Mr Xi might be wise to be seen to delegate. "Xi's absence from this crisis is yet another demonstration that he doesn't so much lead as he does command," Mr Blanchette says. "He's clearly worried that this crisis will blow up in his face, and so he's pushed out underlings to be the public face of the CCP's response." Already there are signs that the censorship is being ratcheted up once again, with Mr Xi ordering senior officials to "strengthen the control over online media". A few days ago, I spoke by phone to the lawyer and blogger, Chen Qiushi, who'd travelled to Wuhan in an attempt to provide independent reporting about the situation. Videos from Mr Chen, and a fellow activist, Fang Bin, have been widely watched, showing not the ranks of patriotic soldier-medics and the building of hospitals that fill state media coverage, but overcrowded waiting rooms and body bags. He told me he was unsure how long he'd be able to carry on. "The censorship is very strict and people's accounts are being closed down if they share my content," he said. Mr Chen has since gone missing. Friends and family believe he's been forced into Wuhan's quarantine system, in an attempt to silence him. China's leaders now find their fate linked to the daily charts of infection rates, published city by city, province by province. There are some signs that the extraordinary quarantine measures may be having an effect - outside of Hubei Province, the worst affected area, the number of new daily infections is falling. But with the need to try to restart the economy - all but frozen now for over a week - the country has begun a slow return to work. Strict quarantine measures will remain in force in the worst affected areas, but workers from other parts of the country are trickling back to the cities, with the task of monitoring and managing their movements being handed to local neighbourhood committees. It will be a difficult balancing act. Too tough an approach risks further choking off business activity, commerce and travel in a consumer environment already suffocating under the deep psychological fear of contagion. Too lax, and any one of the many potential reservoirs of infection, now scattered across the country, could explode into another, separate epidemic. That would require further harsh action, knocking domestic confidence and prolonging the international border closures and flight restrictions put in place at such enormous economic cost. China is insisting that it is a fight well on the way to being won with "unconquerable will" and that lessons have been learned and "shortcomings in preparedness" identified. Questions about the systemic failings behind the disaster are dismissed as foreign "prejudice", as the propaganda machine cranks into overdrive, channelling the narrative and muting the criticisms. But the devastating scale and scope of China's world-threatening catastrophe have already revealed something important. The thousands who have lost family members, the millions living under the quarantine measures and the workers and businesses bearing the financial costs have been asking those difficult questions too. On the snowy banks of the Tonghui river, the giant tribute to Li Wenliang remains intact. When we visited, a few locals were taking photos and talking quietly to each other. A police car crawled slowly by. Soon, with the warming weather, the characters will be gone.
By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website Under the scheme, 11 Genomics Medicine Centres are being set up in English hospitals to gather DNA samples to help devise targeted treatments for a wide range of diseases. It is focusing on cancer and rare genetic diseases. The aim is to sequence 100,000 genomes within three years in order to develop new tests and drugs. Doctors will offer suitable patients the opportunity to take part in the scheme. They will have to agree to have their genetic code and medical records - stripped of anything that could identify them - made available to drugs companies and researchers. Up to 25,000 cancer patients will have the genetic code of their healthy tissue compared to the genetic code of their tumour. A giant game of spot-the-difference will then take place to identify the precise mutations in DNA that are causing a patient's tumour. This would allow targeted medicines to be developed. Genetic code Previous genetics research has shown how different cancers can be - for example that breast cancer is not one disease but at least 10 - each with a different cause and life expectancy and each needing a different treatment. And the development of targeted drugs such as Herceptin - given only if a patient's breast tumour has a certain mutation - has been possible because of genetics research. Meanwhile, 15,000 patients with rare diseases will have their genome compared with those of their parents and grandparents. Thousands of genetic diseases - which are individually rare but combined affect large numbers of people - could be identified by finding mistakes in the three billion pairs of letters that make up our genetic code. The resulting knowledge could give patients an explanation for a disease that has plagued their entire life. Prof Graeme Black, who will lead the project in Manchester, told the BBC: "It's possible to sequence an individual's entire genetic make-up, their genome, in merely a few days where five years ago that was completely unimaginable. "Therefore it's possible for conditions where there's a possibility that it's genetic, that we can identify genetic causes much quicker than had been imagined previously." Case study Edward Sherley-Price has first-hand experience of just how little is known about some conditions. His 11-year-old daughter Alysia has regular seizures. She was diagnosed with a developmental delay before her second birthday, but the cause was unknown. It took until 2013 for genetic testing to discover what was wrong - a rare genetic mutation in a gene known as STXBP1. The family say getting a diagnosis has given them a renewed sense of optimism. The 100,000 Genomes Project could help people like Alysia by identifying a specific mutation, which lead to taking part in future drug trials. The NHS said it was aiming to be the most scientifically advanced healthcare system in the world. Target treatment The 11 Genomics Medicines Centres will open across England in February at: The 11 centres are just the first wave of the project, which will eventually cover the whole of England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are not taking part. The pilots have been under way this year and 3,000 genomes will have been sequenced by January. All the data produced in the 100,000 Genomes project will be stripped of anything that could identify the patient and then be made available to drugs companies and researchers to help them create precision drugs for future generations. The project's leaders say it will be the partnership between the health service, industry and academics that will deliver a new era of genetics-based medicine. 'Devastating diseases' NHS England medical director Prof Bruce Keogh said the impact of genomic medicine will be on the same scale as other British successes including the smallpox vaccine and IVF. He said: "Our NHS is better equipped for the emerging science that will determine the future practice of medicine than any other Western healthcare system. "[It] puts us in a position to unlock a series of secrets about devastating diseases, that have remained hidden for centuries, for the whole of human kind." Life sciences minister George Freeman said: "We want to make the UK the best place in the world to design and discover 21st century medicines." Angela Douglas, chairwoman of the British Society of Genetic Medicine, said: "The challenge of the project will be to embed its outcomes into routine health practice. "The genetics community looks forward to working with researchers, scientists, associated medical specialists and Genomics England to meet that challenge."
Mr Castro, 87, attended the opening of an art studio in the capital, Havana, on Wednesday night. Pictures released on Thursday showed a frail-looking Mr Castro walking with a stick and looking at works of art. Fidel Castro led Cuba for nearly half a century before handing over power to his brother, Raul, in 2006 because of ill health. Fidel has kept a low public profile, with sporadic appearances, ever since. The last time he appeared in public was on 9 April last year, when he attended the inauguration of a Havana school. Pictures of the former Cuban leader were last seen in December, after his private meeting with the visiting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a key ally of Cuba.
Assange took refuge in the embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden over a sexual assault case that has since been dropped. At Westminster Magistrates' Court on Thursday he was found guilty of failing to surrender to the court. He now faces US federal conspiracy charges related to one of the largest ever leaks of government secrets. The UK will decide whether to extradite Assange, in response to allegations by the Department for Justice that he conspired with former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to download classified databases. He faces up to five years in US prison if convicted on the charges of conspiracy to commit computer intrusion. Assange's lawyer Jennifer Robinson said they would be fighting the extradition request. She said it set a "dangerous precedent" where any journalist could face US charges for "publishing truthful information about the United States". She said she had visited Assange in the police cells where he thanked supporters and said: "I told you so." Assange had predicted that he would face extradition to the US if he left the embassy. What happened in court? After his arrest, the 47-year-old Australian national was initially taken to a central London police station before appearing in court. Dressed in a black suit and black polo shirt, he waved to the public gallery and gave a thumbs up. He pleaded not guilty to the 2012 charge of failing to surrender to the court. Finding him guilty of that charge, District Judge Michael Snow said Assange's behaviour was "the behaviour of a narcissist who cannot get beyond his own selfish interest". He sent him to Southwark Crown Court for sentencing, where he faces up to 12 months in prison. The court also heard that during his arrest at the embassy he had to be restrained and shouted: "This is unlawful, I am not leaving." Why does the US government want to extradite Assange? Assange set up Wikileaks in 2006 with the aim of obtaining and publishing confidential documents and images. The organisation hit the headlines four years later when it released footage of US soldiers killing civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. Former US intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning was arrested in 2010 for disclosing more than 700,000 confidential documents, videos and diplomatic cables to the anti-secrecy website. She said she only did so to spark debates about foreign policy, but US officials said the leak put lives at risk. She was found guilty by a court martial in 2013 of charges including espionage. However, her jail sentence was later commuted. Manning was recently jailed for refusing to testify before an investigation into Wikileaks' role in revealing the secret files. What are the US charges against him? The indictment against Assange, issued last year in the state of Virginia, alleges that he conspired in 2010 with Manning to access classified information on Department of Defense computers. He faces up to five years in jail. Manning downloaded four databases from US departments and agencies between January and May 2010, the indictment says. This information, much of which was classified, was provided to Wikileaks. The US Justice Department described it as "one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States". Cracking a password stored on the computers, the indictment alleges, would have allowed Manning to log on to them in such a way as to make it harder for investigators to determine the source of the disclosures. It is unclear whether the password was actually broken. Correspondents say the narrowness of the charge seems intended to avoid falling foul of the US Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press. Why did the Ecuadorian embassy stop protecting him? The Wikileaks co-founder had been in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012, after seeking asylum there to avoid extradition to Sweden on a rape allegation. The investigation into the alleged rape, which he denied, was later dropped because he had evaded the arrest warrant. The Swedish Prosecution Authority has said it is now considering whether to resume the inquiry before the statute of limitations runs out in August 2020. Scotland Yard said it was invited into the embassy on Thursday by the ambassador, following the Ecuadorian government's withdrawal of asylum. Ecuadorian president Lenin Moreno said the country had "reached its limit on the behaviour of Mr Assange". Mr Moreno said: "The most recent incident occurred in January 2019, when Wikileaks leaked Vatican documents. "This and other publications have confirmed the world's suspicion that Mr Assange is still linked to WikiLeaks and therefore involved in interfering in internal affairs of other states." His accusations against Assange also included blocking security cameras at the embassy, accessing security files and confronting guards. Mr Moreno said the British government had confirmed in writing that Assange "would not be extradited to a country where he could face torture or the death penalty". The arrest comes a day after Wikileaks said it had uncovered an extensive spying operation against its co-founder at the Ecuadorian embassy. There has been a long-running dispute between the Ecuadorian authorities and Assange about what he was and was not allowed to do in the embassy. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said that over the years they had removed his access to the internet and accused him of engaging in political activities - which is not allowed when claiming asylum. He said: "Precisely what has happened in the embassy is not clear - there has been claim and counter claim." How have people reacted? Prime Minister Theresa May told the House of Commons: "This goes to show that in the UK, no one is above the law." Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the arrest was the result of "years of careful diplomacy" and that it was "not acceptable" for someone to "escape facing justice". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said that Assange had revealed "evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan" and his extradition "should be opposed by the British government". Press freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders said that the UK should resist extradition, because it would "set a dangerous precedent for journalists, whistleblowers, and other journalistic sources that the US may wish to pursue in the future". Australia's Foreign Minister Marise Payne said he would continue to receive "the usual consular support" and that consular officers will try to visit him. And actress Pamela Anderson, who has visited the embassy to support Assange, said the arrest was a "vile injustice". Timeline: Julian Assange saga
By Mir SabbirBBC Bengali, Dhaka Her courage in speaking out against sexual assault, her death five days after being set alight and everything that happened in-between has gripped Bangladesh and brought attention to the vulnerability of sexual harassment victims in this conservative South Asian country. Nusrat, who was 19, was from Feni, a small town 100 miles (160km) south of Dhaka. She was studying at a madrassa, or Islamic school. On 27 March, she said the headmaster called her into his office and repeatedly touched her in an inappropriate manner. Before things could go any further she ran out. Many girls and young women in Bangladesh choose to keep their experiences of sexual harassment or abuse secret for fear of being shamed by society or their families. What made Nusrat Jahan different is that she didn't just speak out - she went to the police with the help of her family on the day the alleged abuse happened. At the local police station she gave a statement. She should have been provided with a safe environment to recall her traumatic experiences. Instead she was filmed by the officer in charge on his phone as she described the ordeal. In the video Nusrat is visibly distressed and tries to hide her face with her hands. The policeman is heard calling the complaint "no big deal" and telling her to move her hands from her face. The video was later leaked to local media. 'I tried to take her to school' Nusrat Jahan Rafi was from a small town, came from a conservative family, and went to a religious school. For a girl in her position, reporting sexual harassment can come with consequences. Victims often face judgement from their communities, harassment, in person and online, and in some cases violent attacks. Nusrat went on to experience all of these. On 27 March, after she went to the police, they arrested the headmaster. Things then got worse for Nusrat. A group of people gathered in the streets demanding his release. The protest had been arranged by two male students and local politicians were allegedly in attendance. People began to blame Nusrat. Her family say they started to worry about her safety. Nevertheless, on 6 April, 11 days after the alleged sexual assault, Nusrat went to her school to sit her final exams. "I tried to take my sister to school and tried to enter the premises, but I was stopped and wasn't allowed to enter," said Nusrat's brother, Mahmudul Hasan Noman. "If I hadn't been stopped, something like this wouldn't have happened to my sister," he said. According to a statement given by Nusrat, a fellow female student took her to the roof of the school, saying one of her friends was being beaten up. When Nusrat reached the rooftop four or five people, wearing burqas, surrounded her and allegedly pressured her to withdraw the case against the headmaster. When she refused, they set her on fire. Police Bureau of Investigation chief Banaj Kumar Majumder said the killers wanted "to make it look like a suicide". Their plan failed when Nusrat was rescued after they fled the scene. She was able to give a statement before she died. "One of the killers was holding her head down with his hands, so kerosene wasn't poured there and that's why her head wasn't burned," Mr Majumder told BBC Bengali. But when Nusrat was taken to a local hospital, doctors found burns covering 80% of her body. Unable to treat the burns, they sent her to Dhaka Medical College Hospital. In the ambulance, fearing she might not survive, she recorded a statement on her brother's mobile phone. "The teacher touched me, I will fight this crime till my last breath," you can hear her say. She also identified some of her attackers as students at the madrassa. News of Nusrat's health dominated Bangladeshi media. On 10 April, she died. Thousands of people turned out for her funeral in Feni. Police have since arrested 15 people, seven of them allegedly involved in the murder. Among those arrested are the two male students who organised the protest in support of the headmaster. The headmaster himself remains in custody. The policeman who filmed Nusrat's sexual harassment complaint has been removed from his post and transferred to another department. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina met Nusrat's family in Dhaka and promised that every person involved in the killing would be brought to justice. "None of the culprits will be spared from legal action," she said. Nusrat's death has sparked protests and thousands have used social media to express their anger about both her case and the treatment of sexual assault victims in Bangladesh. "Many girls don't protest out of fear after such incidents. Burqas, even dresses made of iron cannot stop rapists," said Anowar Sheikh on BBC Bengali's Facebook page. "I wanted a daughter my whole life, but now I am afraid. Giving birth to a daughter in this country means a life of fear and worry," wrote Lopa Hossain in her Facebook post. According to women's rights group Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, there were 940 incidents of rape in Bangladesh in 2018. But researchers say the real number is likely to be much higher. "When a woman tries to get justice for sexual harassment, she has to face a lot of harassment again. The case lingers for years, there is shaming in society, a lack of willingness from police to properly investigate the allegations," said Salma Ali, a human rights lawyer and former director of the Women Lawyers' Association. "It leads the victim to give up on seeking justice. Ultimately the criminals don't get punished and they do the same crime again. Others don't fear to do the same because of such examples." Now people are asking: Why did Nusrat's case only get attention after she was attacked? And will her case change the way people view sexual harassment in Bangladesh? In 2009, the country's Supreme Court passed an order to establish sexual harassment cells in all educational institutions where students can take their complaints, but very few schools have taken up the initiative. Activists are now demanding the order be implemented and enshrined in law to protect students. "This incident has shaken us, but as we have seen in the past, such incidents get forgotten in time. I don't think there will be a big change after this. We have to see if justice gets done," said Professor Kaberi Gayen of the University of Dhaka. "Change has to come in, both psychologically and in implementing the rule of law. Awareness about sexual harassment should be raised from childhood in schools," she said. "They have to learn what is right and wrong when it comes to sexual harassment."
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin presented the findings as he reasserted the case for the new rail line. The report, from accountants KPMG, says that regions outside London will be the biggest beneficiaries of the new service. But the economic boost will not be felt until 2037, it says. In a speech at the Institute of Civil Engineers, Mr McLoughlin argued that rejecting HS2 would amount to a "national loss of nerve". HS2 was necessary because the "clogged arteries" of the nation's transport system needed a "heart bypass", he said. But Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs, told the BBC: "Any private investor would consider this to be a colossal waste of money. "That is not to say that we don't need to improve capacity. Rail is an extraordinarily expensive way of doing that." The government was asking UK taxpayers to take "a huge gamble on their extremely dodgy numbers", he added. 'Stronger' Mr McLoughlin argued that the benefits of HS2 were not simply faster journey times and new jobs, but up to 500,000 fewer lorry journeys a day on the country's roads, according to a separate report. "High Speed Two will make Liverpool stronger. Manchester stronger. Leeds stronger. Britain stronger", he said. "A £15bn annual boost to the economy. With the North and Midlands gaining at least double the benefit of the south." Dismissing "scare stories" over the budget, he maintained that it would remain £42.6bn, with a contingency fund of £14.4bn. But earlier this week, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) criticised the scheme, saying: "So far, the Department [of Transport] has made decisions based on fragile numbers, out-of-date data and assumptions which do not reflect real life." The committee also said there was no evidence the line would help the growth of regional cities and would instead draw even more business to London. KPMG's report was commissioned by HS2 Ltd, which is a non-departmental public body wholly owned by the Department for Transport. Report author Richard Threlfall, KPMG's head of infrastructure, said: "What I hope this work will do is put some new evidence into the debate, because what we've seen over the last few months is an awful lot of opinions and to be honest not a lot of evidence on the ground as to what effect this will have. "And what our report shows, beyond any reasonable doubt, is that HS2 will deliver massive benefits to the UK economy." 'Creaking' John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, told the BBC: "Businesses up and down the country are absolutely convinced that this is a really important infrastructure project. It is one of the key infrastructure projects for the UK." He argued that simply renovating existing rail lines that were "creaking at the seams" would cause "chaos". The latest study was commissioned by HS2 Ltd, the company responsible for developing and promoting the project. It says Birmingham's economy could be boosted between 2.1% and 4.2% a year, while Manchester would benefit between 0.8% and 1.7%. For Leeds, the boost would be 1.6% and London 0.5%. Wednesday's report calculates the benefits of the project in a different way from previous efforts. Time saved is a less important part of the calculation. Instead, the report includes the benefits of extra seats, which means passengers will be able to work while travelling. It also takes into account the reduction in congestion elsewhere on the network. "The point about High Speed Two is that you won't have to travel on it to gain from the better transport system and economic growth it will support," he said. The high-speed line would run between London and Birmingham from 2026 before being extended to Manchester and Leeds from 2033.
Covid-19 is an entirely new disease, which disproportionately affects older people. The deadly strain of influenza that swept the globe in 1918 tended to strike those aged between 20 and 30, with strong immune systems. But the actions taken by governments and individuals to prevent the spread of infection have a familiar ring to them. Public Health England studied the Spanish flu outbreak to draw up its initial contingency plan for coronavirus, the key lesson being that the second wave of the disease, in the autumn of 1918, proved to be far more deadly than the first. Britain was still at war when the virus claimed its first recorded victim, in May 1918. The government, like many others, was caught on the hop. It appears to have decided that the war effort took precedence over preventing flu deaths. The disease spread like wildfire in crowded troop transports and munitions factories, and on buses and trains, according to a 1919 report by Sir Arthur Newsholme for the Royal Society of Medicine. But a "memorandum for public use" he had written in July 1918, that advised people to stay at home if they were sick and to avoid large gatherings, was buried by the government. Sir Arthur argued that many lives could have been saved if these rules had been followed, but he added: "There are national circumstances in which the major duty is to 'carry on', even when risk to health and life is involved." The flu did not originate in Spain, but Spain was the first country to report deaths from it, leading to the assumption that it must have started there. Spain's newspapers were not subject to wartime censorship, because it was a neutral country. News of the epidemic was initially suppressed in other countries to avoid damaging morale. In 1918, there were no treatments for influenza and no antibiotics to treat complications such as pneumonia. Hospitals were quickly overwhelmed. There was no centrally imposed lockdown to curb the spread of infection, although many theatres, dance halls, cinemas and churches were closed, in some cases for months. Pubs, which were already subject to wartime restrictions on opening hours, mostly stayed open. The Football League and the FA Cup had been cancelled for the war, but there was no effort to cancel other matches or limit crowds, with men's teams playing in regional competitions, and women's football, which attracted large crowds, continuing throughout the pandemic. Streets in some towns and cities were sprayed with disinfectant and some people wore anti-germ masks, as they went about their daily lives. Public health messages were confused - and, just like today, fake news and conspiracy theories abounded, although the general level of ignorance about healthy lifestyles did not help. In some factories, no-smoking rules were relaxed, in the belief that cigarettes would help prevent infection. During a Commons debate on the pandemic, Conservative MP Claude Lowther asked: "Is it a fact that a sure preventative against influenza is cocoa taken three times a day?" Publicity campaigns and leaflets warned against spreading disease through coughs and sneezes. In November 1918, the News of the World advised its readers to: "wash inside nose with soap and water each night and morning; force yourself to sneeze night and morning, then breathe deeply. Do not wear a muffler; take sharp walks regularly and walk home from work; eat plenty of porridge." No country was untouched by the 1918 pandemic, although the scale of its impact, and of government efforts to protect their populations, varied widely. In the United States, some states imposed quarantines on their citizens, with mixed results, while others tried to make the wearing of face masks compulsory. Cinemas, theatres and other places of entertainment were closed across the country. New York was better prepared than most US cities, having already been through a 20-year campaign against tuberculosis, and as a result suffered a lower death rate. Nevertheless, the city's health commissioner came under pressure from businesses to keep premises open, particularly movie theatres and other places of entertainment. Then, as now, fresh air was seen as a potential bulwark against the spread of infection, leading to some ingenious solutions to keep society going. But it proved impossible to prevent mass gatherings in many US cities, particularly at places of worship. By the end of the pandemic, the death toll in Britain was 228,000, and a quarter of the population are thought to have been infected. Efforts to kill the virus continued for some time, and the population were more aware than ever of the potentially deadly nature of seasonal influenza. All photographs subject to copyright
By Reality Check teamBBC News The vessel was said to be transporting gold, silver and precious gems collected in the South American colonies to be shipped to Spain's King Philip V to help finance the war of Spanish succession. Colombia said it first discovered the wreck, located somewhere off the coast of Cartagena, in 2015. Last year, the president Juan Manuel Santos said the salvage operation "begins a new chapter in the cultural and scientific history, not only of Colombia but of the entire world". Meanwhile, a team of marine archaeologists, with the help of an underwater robot, started an investigation and have published new information about what has been uncovered so far. Some people have already speculated it could be the most valuable shipwreck of all time and worth billions. The San Jose is one of thousands of shipwrecks around the world and excavating historic cargo is an enticing prospect for archaeologists and treasure hunters. So, who has the rights to a shipwreck? There are international agreements that have rules for some parts of the treasure-hunting process. However, the decision of who is entitled to keep the contents of a valuable vessel tends to end up being made between countries under international law, says Robert Mackintosh, a lawyer and archaeologist at Southampton University. "It's a very complex picture, as a lot of states and people can have a lot of different and often competing interests in wrecks, interests which have their origins in various different bodies of law," he said. For example, the ship's original owner has a viable right to ownership. But that right can be superseded by the country which owns the national waters in which the ship was discovered. 'Plucked out of the air' "The ocean is the world's greatest museum," says marine archaeologist Peter Campbell. And hunting for treasure on sunken ships is big business. Speculation about the value of the contents of a wreck can skyrocket even before items have been removed. But often the operational costs of the archaeological investigation can be higher than the value of the wreck itself, says Mr Campbell. News reports suggest the contents of the San Jose might be worth up to $17bn (£12.7bn). Although when the Colombian government went public with the discovery in 2015, the estimated value of the treasure reported was between $1bn and $10bn. That $17bn figure "seems to have been plucked out of the air", says Mr Campbell. Even so, experts agree that the San Jose has immense financial and cultural value. What does the law say? The 2001 Unesco convention on underwater cultural heritage includes rules to help guide best practice for underwater excavations and guidelines regarding the qualifications required for people involved in conservation and site management. The part of Unesco that oversees underwater heritage sites told the BBC it would be delighted to play a role settling claims over shipwrecks. However, it says it has not been approached to act in that capacity. A country may claim ownership of a wreck if it owned the ship in the first place. Even if a vessel was sunk and abandoned for hundreds of years the original owner can still claim ownership rights. There have also been cases of a country transferring ownership of the ship to another country for the vessel to be displayed in a museum. However, ownership can be complicated by the location of the wreck if it lies in the territorial waters of another state. Under international law, a country has complete sovereignty over these waters and so essentially can do what it wants in terms of taking ownership, says Mr Mackintosh. There are further legal ramifications if the wreck lies in international waters. When a ship has been discovered, the country where the ship was registered can point to something called sovereign immunity (in addition to claims of ownership). This refers to a specific category of ships that are immune from legal proceedings by another state. Warships and other government ships operated for non-commercial purposes enjoy sovereign immunity, says Mr Mackintosh. Under the sovereign immunity principle in 2009, a judge in the US ruled the court lacked jurisdiction over a case involving a treasure hunting company called Odyssey Marine Exploration and the wreck of the Spanish ship the Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes. The US company found 17 tonnes of coins off the coast of Gibraltar and transported them to the US. But the company was ordered to give back the haul - an estimated half a million coins and other artefacts - to the government of Spain. Odyssey said they found the wreck in international waters and claimed salvage rights. Spain said it had never relinquished ownership of the ship's cargo and the coins were part of the country's national heritage. The origins of contents of a ship may also be disputed. For example, in the case involving Odyssey and the Mercedes shipwreck, Peru submitted claims to US courts that stated that the origin of the precious cargo was Peru where the coins were mined and minted while it was part of the Spanish empire.

The star - who is taking on the role for a third time in the latest film Skyfall - told the BBC he would "keep going until they tell me to stop". He admitted there were big expectations for the film to be a success with the Bond franchise celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. However, he said the team were "going to put on a good show". Craig added although he wanted to leave his mark on the films, he was under no illusion he would have to eventually give up the 007 role. "I know there'll be someone after me, and hopefully someone after them - I'm just trying to keep [the series] going." There has been a four-year gap between the previous film Quantum of Solace and the new film. Production was temporarily suspended in April 2010 due to uncertainty over film company MGM's future amid financial troubles. But the actor said work had still been going on behind the scenes. "We haven't been resting on our laurels, we've been plotting what to do with this film," he said. "The first one was a whirr - it was a new experience and flew by - the second one was the tricky second album, but this one we've really planned and got a great script. "It's going to be different from the last one, but it will still be a great Bond movie." Skyfall, which is directed by Oscar-winner Sam Mendes, also stars Javier Bardem, Albert Finney, Ralph Fiennes and sees Dame Judi Dench return as M. Filming has taken place in Shanghai and Turkey, but the action has now moved to the 007 stage at Pinewood studios. BBC entertainment reporter Lizo Mzimba had exclusive behind-the-scenes access to the set, and watched the "culmination of a big chase" scene on a set that recreated a London Underground station. "Quite appropriately for the 50th anniversary Bond, a lot of the action is taking place in familiar London landmarks". Skyfall is due for release in the UK on 26 October.
The Gretsch 6120 model was played by Lennon when the band recorded Paperback Writer at London's famous Abbey Road studios in 1966. It is being sold by the late Beatle's cousin David Birch, who was given the guitar a year later. Bidding begins online at 16:00 GMT, ahead of a live auction at Le Meridien hotel in central London on 23 November. The guitar was developed in the 1950s and was favoured by musicians including blues legend Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend of The Who. It is described on auction website tracksauction.com as "one of the most significant of John's guitars to come on to the market in the last 30 years". The website says it was played "whilst the group were approaching the peak of their recording powers". The guitar comes with photographs of Lennon playing it with the rest of the band. Recent auctions of other Beatles memorabilia have included the front door of a Liverpool home once lived in by Paul McCartney, and jackets worn by George Harrison and Ringo Starr.
The Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, the patent licensing arm of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the verdict was important to guard its inventions from unauthorised use. The jury had earlier decided that Apple incorporated patented microchip technology into some iPhones and iPads without permission. Apple said it would appeal. The company declined to comment further. The amount was less than the foundation had claimed. It had originally sought as much as $862m. The sum was lower in part because the judge ruled that Apple had not wilfully infringed the patent. University of Wisconsin-Madison computer sciences professor Gurindar Sohi, one of the inventors of the microchip technology - designed to boost the performance of computer processors - was in the federal court in Madison, Wisconsin, for the decision. "For Dr Sohi, I hope you felt that your invention was vindicated,'' US District Judge William Conley said. 'Seminal work' Carl Gulbrandsen, managing director of the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, said: "This is a case where the hard work of our university researchers and the integrity of patenting and licensing discoveries has prevailed. "The jury recognised the seminal computer processing work that took place on our campus.'' The case relates to use of the technology in the iPhone 5s, 6 and 6 Plus - but an additional lawsuit making the same claim against Apple's newest models, the 6S and 6S Plus, has also been filed. The University of Wisconsin sued Intel over the same patent in 2008. That case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. Despite recent well-publicised truces between some big tech firms, fierce patent battles are still being fought in courts globally. A judge recently threw out claims by graphic card specialist Nvidia that Samsung and others had infringed three of its patents. Apple's annual revenue in 2014 was $182bn.
The steep fall in the value of imports reflects lower commodity prices globally, particularly crude oil. The numbers mean China's monthly trade surplus expanded by close to 40% from the month earlier to 368bn yuan ($57.8bn; £37.7bn). China recently revised down its 2014 economic growth from 7.4% to 7.3%, its weakest for almost 25 years. In US dollar denominated terms, exports for the month of August fell 5.5% from a year earlier - slightly less than expected - while imports fell by 13.8%, leaving China with a surplus of $60.24bn. Currency conversion factors based on US dollar and Chinese yuan movements over the last year mean some official numbers from the mainland are now reported in both currencies. A fall in both import and export figures had been expected as China's economy slows, though analysts said the drop in imports was greater than forecast. "Chinese investors are now poised to expect a slew of weak economic data ranging from foreign trade to PMI [purchasing manager's index] to industrial output," said Xiao Shijun, an analyst at Guodo Securities in Beijing. But he said investors were "no longer nervous about relatively poor figures. So unless there are fresh surprises on the downside, market impact will be limited".
By Judith BurnsBBC News education reporter Ucas admissions data from mid-December show applications from English students at their lowest since 2009. The trebling of maximum tuition fees saw a drop in applications for autumn 2012 but university leaders hoped demand would recover in 2013. A Ucas spokesman said it was too early to say whether overall applications would be down. The general deadline for applying to start university in autumn 2013 is 15 January, although people may apply later. These interim figures were collated by Ucas on 17 December, by which time some 265,730 people living in the UK had applied to start degree courses this autumn, down 6.3% on the same point in 2012. Application slump Among students living in England, applications were down 6.5% on 2012 at 229,932. The steepest drop in applications was from students living in Wales, down 11.7% to 11,218. Applications from Scottish students fell by 3.9% while there was a marginal increase in applications in Northern Ireland - up 0.5%. The Ucas spokesman stressed that the December sampling point was a few days before the end of term for many schools and suggested that many applications would have come in after that. 'A snapshot' He pointed out that in previous years up to 40% of applications have come in during the final month before the deadline. Pam Tatlow, chief executive of university group Million+ said: "The worrying trend of falling university applications continues, according to the most recent statistics published by UCAS. "We urge the government to step in with a national campaign to promote the value of university for potential students currently considering their options, whether they are about to leave school or considering a university course later in life." But Dr Wendy Piatt, director general of the Russell Group of universities, agreed with UCAS that it was too early in the year to judge overall application figures. "Let's not jump the gun... It's only right that prospective students are taking their time deciding which universities to apply to and making use of all the information available to them." Nicola Dandridge of Universities UK said the December figures were "a snapshot" but warned: "We must be concerned about any drops in the numbers applying to university and in particular, we must look closely at how the increase in graduate contributions in England may be affecting the decisions of prospective students. "The December figures show a drop in numbers across the UK, suggesting that it is not solely a question of tuition fees in England putting students off from applying." 'Bottom line' University and College Union general secretary Sally Hunt said: "The bottom line is that hiking up the cost is likely to have an impact on people's decisions when it comes to further study. "We need our brightest people pursuing their dreams. We simply cannot afford to fall behind other countries that are seeing a rise in the number of students and graduates. More must be done to encourage people to aspire to university and far greater efforts made to support them when they are there." A government spokeswoman said: "It is too early to form a definitive picture about university applications for the 2013-14 academic year. Traditionally fewer than 50% of applicants have submitted their applications by this point in the cycle. "It is important that no one is put off applying to university because they do not have information about the student support available to them. Most new students will not pay upfront, there will be more financial support for those from poorer families and everyone will make lower loan repayments than they do now once they are in well paid jobs." Applications to UK universities were at their highest in 2011 but dropped by 6.6% last year when the government increased tuition fees to up to £9,000 a year.
The Queen is expected to arrive in France on 5 June and spend the following day in Normandy for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings. She will then travel on to Paris, with Prince Philip. The Queen, who last made a state visit to France in April 2004, was invited by France's president Francois Hollande. In a short statement, the palace said: "The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, will make a state visit to France from 5 to 7 June. "Her Majesty and His Royal Highness are visiting at the invitation of the President of France, President Hollande. "On 6 June the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will attend events in Normandy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings. "On 6 and 7 June Her Majesty and His Royal Highness will attend state visit events in Paris and be received at the Elysee Palace by President Hollande."
The US Fair Labor Association (FLA) was asked by Apple to investigate working conditions at Foxconn after reports of long hours and poor safety. The FLA says it has now secured agreements to reduce hours, protect pay, and improve staff representation. Apple said it "fully accepted" the report's recommendations. "We share the FLA's goal of improving lives and raising the bar for manufacturing companies everywhere," it said in a statement. The findings emerged as Apple CEO Tim Cook visited Foxconn facilities. Mr Cook toured Zhengzhou Technology Park, where 120,000 employees work, on Wednesday. A string of suicides at Foxconn last year put the spotlight on working conditions at its factories. Last month, the company announced it was to send independent inspectors from the FLA to audit the facilities. Legal limits The investigation - one of the largest ever conducted of a US company's operations abroad - found employees often worked more than 60 hours a week and sometimes for seven days running without the required day off. Other violations included unpaid overtime and health and safety risks. Average monthly salaries at the three factories ranged from $360 (£227) to $455 (£289). Foxconn raised salaries by up to 25% recently. The FLA said Foxconn had agreed to comply with the association's standards on working hours by July 2013, bringing them in line with a legal limit in China of 49 hours per week. The company will hire thousands more workers in order to compensate for the move, Reuters reports. The BBC's Adam Brookes in Washington says the report has been much anticipated as embodying a new and transparent approach to an old problem: that of cheap but popular consumer goods manufactured in poor conditions in developing countries. However, he says, a telling line in the report is the one which notes that the Foxconn workers did not have true trade union representation. The authorities in China are very wary of unions and are likely to remain so. Before the report was released, labour unions expressed doubts that the company was committed to improving standards. "The report will include new promises by Apple that stand to be just as empty as the ones made over the past 5 years," SumOfUS.org, a coalition of trade unions and consumer groups, said. Foxconn employs 1.2 million workers in China to produce products for Apple as well as Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, and other companies.
The post linked to an article by state-run media which claimed women were no longer "baby making machines" due to action on alleged religious extremism. Beijing is alleged to have forced many Uighur women to be sterilised or fitted with contraceptive devices, apparently to control population growth. China has denied the allegations. The Uighurs are a mostly Muslim minority group which lives mainly in Xinjiang province in northwestern China. The tweet, published on Thursday, also claimed that Uighur women were "more confident and independent" as a result of "reproductive health" being "promoted" to them. Over the weekend, the tweet was replaced with a message from the social media site which claimed the tweet "violated" Twitter's rules, without providing further details. The original tweet had linked to an article by China Daily, a state-run newspaper, which alleged the eradication of extremism in Xinjiang "had given Uighur women more autonomy when deciding whether to have children". The article referenced a report by the Xinjiang Development Research Centre which said: "The changes were not caused by 'forced sterilisation' of the Uyghur population, as repeatedly claimed by some western scholars and politicians." Last year, a report by China scholar Adrian Zenz alleged Uighur and other ethnic minority women were being threatened with internment in camps for refusing to abort pregnancies that exceeded birth quotas. The findings were based on a combination of official regional data, policy documents and interviews with ethnic minority women in Xinjiang. The report also said that Uighur women with more than the legally permitted number of children - but also many women who had not exceeded birth quotas - were involuntarily fitted with intra-uterine devices (IUDs), while others were coerced into receiving sterilisation surgery. Under current rules, couples in China are allowed to have up to two children, with couples in some rural areas allowed up to three. Former detainees in internment camps, which China says are re-education camps to tackle extremism, said they were given injections that stopped their periods, or caused unusual bleeding consistent with the effects of birth control drugs. According to Mr Zenz's analysis of the data, natural population growth in Xinjiang has declined dramatically in recent years, with growth rates falling by 84% in the two largest Uighur prefectures between 2015 and 2018 and declining further in 2019. Following the release of that report, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on "all nations to join the United States in demanding an end to these dehumanising practices". China said at the time that the allegations were "baseless" and showed "ulterior motives". Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused media outlets of "cooking up false information on Xinjiang-related issues". Coverage of China's hidden camps
The decision comes in response to uncertainty caused by the UK's decision to leave the EU, the bank said. The vote on 23 June caused global market turmoil and pushed the pound to 31-year lows. The Singapore dollar has gained about 10% since the referendum. Singaporeans were the top Asian buyers of UK commercial property in 2015, according to consultancy Knight Frank. UOB told the BBC in a statement: "We will temporarily stop receiving foreign property loan applications for London properties." "As the aftermath of the UK referendum is still unfolding and given the uncertainties, we need to ensure our customers are cautious with their London property investments." Analysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia Business correspondent Read this as the bank telling Singapore borrowers - hold your horses chaps, you may be in for a bumpy ride. Market sources tell me that UOB has the highest exposure amongst the big three banks in Singapore to London property loans. UOB doesn't disclose how much it lends out for the London portfolio but it also offers international loans for Australia and Thailand. "From a banking perspective, this [the possibility of Brexit] is just the tip of the iceberg," Sam Ahmed, Managing Director of Deriv Asia told me. "And banks will look to protect themselves from unintended consequences and adopt a more conservative approach by limiting their exposure for UK based assets." Read more from Karishma: Asian banks assess London property risks Singapore's biggest lender, DBS, is continuing to provide financing, but is advising its customers to be cautious. "For customers interested in buying properties in London, we would advise them to assess the situation carefully," DBS executive director of secured lending, Tok Geok Peng, told the BBC. "With foreign exchange risks, even if the value of the overseas property rises, any gains will be eroded if the country's currency depreciates against the Singapore dollar," Mr Tok explained. Singapore's other big lender, OCBC bank, told the BBC it had not made any changes to its advisory policy. Head of consumer secured lending Phang Lah Hwa told the BBC that OCBC was still making financing available for London properties and was "monitoring the situation closely".
After the surrender of Japan on 14 August 1945, two days of national holiday were announced for celebrations in the UK, the US and Australia. Millions of people from the Allied countries took part in parades and street parties. Germany had surrendered on 7 May 1945, followed by Victory in Europe (VE) Day on 8 May, but World War Two still continued in the Asia-Pacific region. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said then: "We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing, but let us not forget for a moment the toil and efforts that lie ahead." An estimated 71,000 soldiers from Britain and the Commonwealth were killed in the war against Japan, including more than 12,000 prisoners of war who died in Japanese captivity. Japan treated prisoners of war very badly, including American and British soldiers who had surrendered. Following the end of the fighting in Europe, the Allies told Japan to surrender by 28 July 1945, but the deadline passed without them doing so. It wasn't until the US had dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on 6 and 9 August, that Japan surrendered and ended the war. The recorded death tolls of the atomic bombings are estimates, but it is thought that about 140,000 of Hiroshima's 350,000 population were killed in the blast, and at least 74,000 people died in Nagasaki. After days of rumours, US President Harry S Truman broke the news of Japan's surrender at a press conference on 14 August. In an address to a crowd that had gathered outside the White House, President Truman said: "This is the day we have been waiting for since Pearl Harbor. This is the day when fascism finally dies, as we always knew it would." British Prime Minister Clement Atlee said: "The last of our enemies is laid low." He expressed gratitude to Britain's allies, the Dominions of Australia and New Zealand, India, Burma, all countries occupied by Japan, and the USSR. He added that special thanks went to the US "without whose prodigious efforts the war in the East would still have many years to run". The following day, Japan's Emperor Hirohito was heard on the radio for the first time ever in a broadcast in which he blamed the use of "a new and most cruel bomb" for Japan's unconditional surrender. He added: "Should we continue to fight, it would not only result in the ultimate collapse and obliteration of the Japanese nation, but would lead also to the total extinction of human civilisation." In London, the Royal Family greeted cheering crowds from the balcony of Buckingham Palace. Thousands watched King George VI and the Queen driven down the Mall in an open carriage. Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret later mingled with the crowds outside the palace. That evening, the King addressed the nation and the Empire in a broadcast from his study at Buckingham Palace. He said: "Our hearts are full to overflowing, as are your own. "Yet there is not one of us who has experienced this terrible war who does not realise that we shall feel its inevitable consequences long after we have all forgotten our rejoicings today." The official surrender documents were signed by Japan on 2 September aboard the USS Missouri battleship in Tokyo Bay. VE Day and VJ Day marked victory for the Allies, but the lives of millions who had lost loved ones had been changed forever. All photographs subject to copyright.
By Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese Service, Washington When Boston Logan International Airport's announcement asked Keith Zhang to come to the boarding desk, he thought it was a regular boarding check. But when he saw two armed American officers expecting him there, his heart sank. "They questioned me under the premise that I am here to steal technology," Keith Zhang - not his real name - tells the BBC. Zhang, a 26-year-old PhD student from China, was a visiting researcher at Brown University's department of psychological sciences for a year. He had not expected to spend his last two hours on US soil being interrogated about his potential ties with the Chinese Communist Party. So what might have happened? FBI director Christopher Wray recently said, in response to Beijing's "far-reaching campaign" of economic espionage, the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case every 10 hours. In July, Washington closed the Chinese consulate in Houston, calling it a "spy centre". As the US tightens its scrutiny of Chinese nationals over espionage concerns, screening selected departing Chinese students and researchers appears to be Washington's new measure to counter economic espionage. Some of the students' electronic devices were taken away for further examination and not returned for weeks. Zhang describes the screening as "pure harassment". "If I were to steal any data or intellectual property, I could send it through cloud storage. Taking away my laptop and phone for examination does nothing more than harassment," Zhang says. China's foreign ministry accuses Washington of "abusing" the judicial power to interrogate and arrest Chinese students in the US "under fabricated allegations". However, a series of indictments against Chinese researchers suggest the suspicions of US authorities have some grounds. In August, Haizhou Hu, a 34-year-old Chinese visiting scholar at the University of Virginia, was arrested when he attempted to board a flight to China at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. The Department of Justice said "a routine screening" revealed that his laptop contained research-related software code, which he was not authorised to possess. The code has military applications, according to a federal indictment. Separately, the US recently captured multiple Chinese researchers who are accused of concealing their ties with the Chinese military in visa applications. A scientist had allegedly fled to China's consulate in San Francisco, before she was arrested. Another Chinese researcher threw away a damaged hard drive and was later charged with destroying evidence to obstruct an FBI investigation. US Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell tells the BBC that, for students who come to the US with the intent of learning, America's doors are "wide open". "But if you are here masquerading as (students)," he says, "we have to defend ourselves." Sheena Greitens, associate professor of public affairs at University of Texas, Austin, says there's an "intensification of concerns" over technology transfer from the US to China through academic channels. "Given that these are investigations into espionage, it's unlikely that we'll see full details for every case, but it's hard to make informed judgements on the nature of the threat to national security based on the handful of cases we've seen made public so far," Prof Greitens says. Unlike Hu, Zhang was allowed to board his flight at the last minute, but he says the airport screening was "a traumatic experience". He recalls the two armed officers repeatedly accused him of lying. "I was under great pressure and almost had a mental breakdown," he says. Zhang did not ask for the officers' names or identities, nor did he request to speak to a lawyer, Brown University or the Chinese Embassy in the US. "I knew I had these rights but I didn't want to risk missing my flight," Zhang says. Boarding his flight was Zhang's absolute priority, as he was eager to go home to reunite with his wife. They got married a year ago but have spent most of the time apart due to his study in the US. During the pandemic, it is difficult to travel from the US to China, as international flights are curtailed sharply by both countries. Zhang spent weeks and nearly $5,000 to secure flight tickets to his hometown Shanghai via Amsterdam. In general, US law enforcement agents have to get a warrant to search electronic devices, but airports are an exception. US border agents only need "reasonable suspicion" to search travellers' electronic devices at airports. According to the South China Morning Post US border agents carried out over 1,100 searches of Chinese nationals' electronic devices in 2019, recording a 66% increase from the previous year. Prof Greitens says airports are also "a choke point for the physical outflow of information", where legal, physical and personnel infrastructure for the screening are concentrated and where most passengers transit to depart the US. John Demers, US Assistant Attorney General, recently said that the airport screening is "more targeted than it may first appear". He revealed the screening decision is based on the students' schools in China and fields of study. Visiting scholars of an advanced scientific field and from institutions related to the Chinese military, are more likely to be targeted. "What we are trying to do is to write with a fine-pointed pencil, as opposed to a big magic marker," Mr Demers said at a public think-tank event in Washington DC. Both Hu and Zhang received scholarships provided by the China Scholarship Council (CSC) for their research in the US. CSC is an organisation under China's Ministry of Education, providing financial support for educational exchanges between China and other countries. According to a recent research conducted by Georgetown University, CSC sponsors around 65,000 Chinese overseas students, accounting for 7% of Chinese nationals studying aboard. It also funds roughly the same number of foreign students in China. During his exchange study in America, Zhang received a monthly stipend of $1,900 (£1430) from CSC. He was also required to submit a research report every six months, which his collaborator at Brown University would read and sign. China's higher education and research systems are mostly state-owned. Though not all researchers are Chinese Communist Party (CCP) members, the party could cast a shadow of influence on research. CCP has installed representatives and informants in education institutions, and some universities even revised their charters to emphasize unswerving loyalty to the party. At the airport, Zhang told the American law enforcement officers that the CCP has no direct influence on his research in cognitive psychology, which is "highly theoretical". But the officers didn't seem convinced due to the government funding. "It's normal for all governments to fund scientific research. America also funds public universities and labs," Zhang says, "There's no way for me to convince them, if in their views, government funding equals to the Communist Party's direct influence on every single research project." CSC is now under intense scrutiny in the US, as it is considered as an avenue by which Beijing could exert influence over overseas students. On 31 August, the University of North Texas terminated its exchange program with 15 Chinese visiting researchers receiving CSC funding, effectively revoking their US visas. This appears to be the first case of an American university severing ties with CSC. Prof Greitens expects some increased scrutiny of Chinese nationals studying science and technology in the US, especially those who received Chinese government funding, to continue regardless of the outcome of the US election. "Both (Trump and Biden) administrations are likely to take the potential threat of illegal technology transfer between the US and China very seriously," she says. Though Zhang was impressed by the academic rigour in America and enjoyed working with colleagues at Brown University, he says he won't consider ever visiting the country again due to the screening experience. "It was very scary. I felt my safety could be harmed at any time," he says. Worrying for a gloomy prospect of US-China relations, Zhang has started to lobby his Chinese friends in America to consider returning home. "The New Cold War has started," he says. "There's no turning back, no matter who is going to be America's next president."
She succeeds Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who announced his retirement last year. Ms Dick, previously the national policing lead on counter-terrorism, said she was "thrilled and humbled". But her appointment was criticised by the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, who was wrongly shot dead during an operation she led in 2005. The Brazilian electrician was killed two weeks after the 7/7 London Bombings when he was mistakenly identified as a terror suspect. A jury later found the Met had broken health and safety laws, but found there was "no personal culpability for Commander Cressida Dick". Ms Dick, 56, left the Met for the Foreign Office after 31 years of service in December 2014. Londoners' to-do list for the new chief She was chosen for the commissioner's job ahead of National Police Chiefs' Council chairwoman Sara Thornton, Essex Police chief constable Stephen Kavanagh and Scotland Yard's Mark Rowley. Her appointment means that for the first time all three top policing jobs in the UK are held by women: the Met commissioner, the head of the National Crime Agency and the president of the National Police Chief's Council. Ms Dick's statement said: "This is a great responsibility and an amazing opportunity. "I'm looking forward immensely to protecting and serving the people of London and working again with the fabulous women and men of the Met. "Thank you so much to everyone who has taught me and supported me along the way." Big decisions and intense scrutiny By Danny Shaw, home affairs correspondent The new commissioner will find that when it comes to leading the Met, there's no off-switch. It's a policing organisation like no other in the UK, with a budget of £3bn, a workforce of 43,000 and responsibility for keeping everyone in London - from Barking to Buckingham Palace, from West Norwood to Westminster - safe. The leader of Britain's biggest and most influential police force will come under pressure to make early decisions: on whether to roll out controversial spit-guards, on how to police the Notting Hill Carnival and if Tasers should be extended to all officers. She'll face intense scrutiny from the media, which has a tendency to escalate stories of local difficulties into ones of national importance. And she'll be expected to provide regular updates to the London Assembly, MPs on the home affairs committee, the mayor of London and the home secretary. Five challenges for the new chief Theresa May said Ms Dick had the "exceptional qualities" needed to lead the Met. "Her skills and insights will be crucial in shaping the Met as the job of police reform continues, co-ordinating the national response to the ongoing threat of terrorism and serious criminality as well as keeping Londoners safe," the prime minister continued. "In addition, I know she will be a champion for the most vulnerable who the police are there to protect." Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Ms Dick was taking on "one of the most demanding, high-profile and important jobs in UK policing, against the backdrop of a heightened terror alert and evolving threats from fraud and cyber crime". Sir Bernard said his replacement would be "a brilliant beacon for women within and beyond this force". And London Mayor Sadiq Khan said she was the "best possible person" to take the Met forward. "She has already had a long and distinguished career, and her experience and ability has shone throughout this process." But Mr de Menezes' cousins Patricia Armani and Alex Pereira said her appointment was "offensive" to his memory and sent "the message... that police officers can act with impunity". Ms Armani said: "Our family is disappointed that she has now been appointed for such an important role at a time there are many more threats to public security in the form of terrorism. "What are the guarantees that more innocent people won't be killed by the police in London?" Rigby killing Ms Dick's new post commands a salary of £270,648, plus benefits. She first joined the Met in 1983 after a brief spell in accountancy following her graduation from Oxford University. In 2009, she became the first woman to be appointed an assistant commissioner at the force, later becoming the national lead for counter-terrorism across the UK. Her work also included leading the reinvestigation into the murder of Stephen Lawrence and the police response to the killing of soldier Lee Rigby. In 2014, she left Scotland Yard to take up a highly sensitive and undisclosed director-general post at the Foreign Office. Her other experience includes taking on internal reforms of Scotland Yard and being one of the two senior officers in charge of security at the London 2012 Olympic Games.
The photos showing militants rigging the temple with explosives and a large explosion were circulated by the jihadist group's supporters. Syrian officials and activists said on Sunday that it had been blown up. The UN's cultural organisation said the deliberate destruction of Syria's cultural heritage was a war crime. Unesco's director-general, Irina Bokova, accused IS of seeking to "deprive the Syrian people of its knowledge, its identity and history". She also expressed outrage at the beheading last week of Khaled al-Asaad, the retired chief archaeologist at Palmyra, who refused to co-operate with IS. Pile of rubble The Temple of Baalshamin was built nearly 2,000 years ago and was considered the second most important structure at Palmyra - the monumental ruins of a great city that was one of the most important cultural centres of the ancient world. Syria's director of antiquities, Maamoun Abdul Karim, said IS militants had packed the Graeco-Roman temple with large quantities of explosives and detonated them on Sunday, bringing down the inner sanctum, or cella, and surrounding pillars. Three of the images published online on Tuesday appear to show men placing barrels of explosives connected with detonating cord around the temple's interior and on several exterior columns. Another image shows a large explosion and plume of smoke, and a fifth shows the aftermath, with piles of rubble where the temple used to be. Ancient city of Palmyra IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' Syrian ruins that influenced the West Palmyra 'was archaeologist's passion' Your memories of Palmyra One caption reads: "The complete destruction of the pagan Baalshamin temple." The images could not be independently verified, but they carried a logo IS often uses for propaganda from Palmyra, which the group captured from Syrian government forces in May. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict in Syria, reported that the temple was destroyed a month ago. IS has ransacked and demolished several similar ancient sites that pre-date Islam in Iraq, seeing them as symbols of "idolatry". Until the temple was brought down, they had only demolished a statue of a lion from Palmyra, though they used the site's theatre to stage the public execution by children of more than 20 captured Syrian army soldiers.
He was charged with molesting seven girls, many of whom are gymnasts, while working for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. As part of the plea deal, Nassar, 54, could face at least 25 years in prison. The hearing comes after a third former US Olympian, Gabby Douglas, accused him of sexual abuse. Douglas reveals abuse by team doctor In a statement to the court on Wednesday, Nassar said he was pleading guilty to "move the community forward and stop the hurting". "I'm so sorry that this was like a match that turned into a forest fire, out of control," he said. "I want them to heal. I want this community to heal. I have no animosity toward any one. I just want healing. It's time." "You used that position of trust that you had in the most vile way - to abuse children," Ingham County Court Judge Rosemarie Aquilina said, noting that sex abuse is a nationwide "epidemic". "You violated the oath that you took, which is to do no harm, and you harmed them. Selfishly." Many of his accusers testified that they were abused while he was examining the young athletes, and sometimes while their parents were nearby. He has been accused of abusing more than 130 women - including Olympic gold medalists Ms Douglas, Aly Raisman and McKayla Maroney - during his time as team doctor for the US women's gymnastics team. Ms Douglas, who was one of the so-called Fierce Five that won gold medals at the London Olympics in 2012, revealed her accusation on Instagram. "I didn't publicly share my experiences as well as many other things because for years we were conditioned to stay silent and some things were extremely painful," she wrote. During the hearing Ms Raisman, a member of the 2012 and 2016 Olympic teams, tweeted that she was "disgusted" that Nassar, who lost his licence, was referred to as a doctor. Nassar's case was part of a scandal which saw USA Gymnastics president Steve Penny resign last year. Mr Penny was accused by victims of failing to quickly notify authorities about abuse allegations. In a statement after the plea deal was announced, USA Gymnastics - the organisation which determines the US Olympic team - said it is "very sorry that any athlete was harmed" by their former doctor. They added that it was "important" that he acknowledged "his appalling and devious conduct" in court and said the deal "permits punishment without further victimisation of survivors". Nassar has already pleaded guilty to multiple charges of child pornography in federal court and could face a maximum sentence of life in prison. Before accepting the plea, Judge Aquilina asked him to confirm that he did not wear gloves when abusing his victims between 1998 and 2015, when he was fired. The alleged examinations were "not for any medical purposes is that right? It was for your own purpose, is that right?", the judge asked. Nassar responded: "Yes." He is due to be sentenced on 12 January.
Mr Carney told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that, looking at the UK as a whole, "we are now seeing house prices begin to recover, so it is a more generalised phenomenon". He said the only area where prices had not picked up was Northern Ireland. He also said there was little the bank could do to cool the London market, where prices were rising far faster. Cash Prices in London are rising by about 10% a year, but Mr Carney said a change in interest rate policy - not on the cards in any case until the recovery is well established - would not cool the market as a significant number of properties were bought without a mortgage. Asked if he was concerned about the very fast-spiralling London property market, Mr Carney said: "Much of what's driven in London, of course, is not mortgage-driven but is cash-driven. "It's driven, in many cases, by foreign buyers. We, as a central bank, can't influence that. "We change underwriting standards - it doesn't matter, there's not a mortgage. We change interest rates - it doesn't matter, there's not a mortgage, etc. "But we watch it and we watch the knock-on effect." 'Clarity' Mr Carney reiterated his belief that UK interest rates would not return to pre-crisis levels of around 5% until all spare capacity was being used in the economy. He said: "What we've had thus far is a consumer-led recovery. "What we haven't seen yet is business investment picking up. "It's part of the reason why we're trying to provide as much clarity to business that the path of monetary policy, the path of interest rates, is going to be calibrated very carefully, to ensure that only when we see sustainable growth in jobs, in incomes, and in spending will we make adjustments." Last week, Mr Carney overhauled the Bank's interest rate policy to reflect falling unemployment and the economic recovery. The Bank's rate policy will now be determined not just by unemployment, but by a wider range of indicators. Limits Mr Carney also discussed bankers' bonuses, saying new rules ordering banks to keep back more capital could hold back bonus payouts. He said the rules, designed to protect banks from future economic shocks, would prevent them from paying increased bonuses if that would cause capital levels to fall. The rules, known as Basel III, will come into force near the end of this decade and will apply internationally. Mr Carney said they would have a real impact and should change banks' behaviour. He also suggested that bonuses could be deferred for an even longer period than the current three to five years, giving a greater time frame in which they could be clawed back, should it emerge later on that unnecessary risks had been taken. Last week, Barclays increased its bonus pool despite posting a fall in annual profits.
It is known for its expensive tickets, exclusive guest list, and extravagant outfits that are based around a different theme each year. This year, the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination, which showcases how Catholicism has influenced fashion throughout history. Celebrities hit the red carpet on Monday night, sporting papal-inspired gowns, chainmail costumes reminiscent of the Crusades and in singer Katy Perry's case - oversized angel wings. The stories behind six of the most captivating outfits "Fashion and religion have long been intertwined, mutually inspiring and informing one another," curator Andrew Bolton said in a statement on The Met's website. "Although this relationship has been complex and sometimes contested, it has produced some of the most inventive and innovative creations in the history of fashion." All images subject to copyright.
He will appear in court on 7 January over the incident, which allegedly occurred in Nantucket in July 2016. On Monday, Mr Spacey posted a video in which he appears to deny any wrongdoing while in character as Frank Underwood from House of Cards. "I'm certainly not going to pay the price for the things I didn't do," he says in the clip. "You wouldn't believe the worst without evidence, would you?" he asks. "You wouldn't rush to judgements without facts." The alleged victim is the son of former television news presenter Heather Unruh, who spoke publicly about the incident last year. She accused Mr Spacey of buying her then 18-year-old son alcohol - the drinking age in Massachusetts is 21 - and then groping him. In the video, Mr Spacey speaks in Frank Underwood's accent and addresses the viewer directly, much like he did throughout his five seasons on House of Cards. "Of course some believed everything," he says. "They're just waiting with bated breath to hear me confess it all." "They're going to say I'm being disrespectful, not playing by the rules," he adds. "Like I ever played by anyone's rules before. I never did. And you loved it." Frank Underwood was the power-hungry and conniving protagonist of the Netflix series, and murdered a journalist and a politician before he was killed off ahead of season six. The three-minute clip, which is titled Let Me Be Frank, marks Mr Spacey's first public appearance since the first allegation of sexual assault was made against him last November. He was accused by actor Anthony Rapp of making a sexual advance in 1986 and a number of other allegations have since emerged. Mr Spacey said he had no memory of the event but publicly apologised before issuing an "absolute" denial of the other allegations. Separately, in September, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said Mr Spacey would not be prosecuted over an accusation of sexual assault that allegedly took place in 1992. It said it fell outside of California's statute of limitations. UK police are also investigating several allegations that centre around his time serving as artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre. The controversy has led to Mr Spacey being axed from a number of roles, including from House of Cards and the 2017 film All the Money in the World, which was re-shot without him. A film in which he appears, Billionaire Boys Club, also took a record-breaking low of $126 (£98) on its first night in US cinemas in August.
They were killed when a gunman, with links to Islamic State extremists, opened fire on a beach in Sousse, outside two hotels. He had hidden a gun under a beach umbrella and also threw grenades, forcing people to run for their lives. Some survivors have been speaking about their ordeal. Full coverage of the Sousse attack 'I played dead' Angela Evans and her friend lay face down in the sand playing dead as the gunman passed. "We both looked up, stood up, there was this man there in black, several rows of sun loungers away just stood there with his huge gun moving round all the people shooting them, just killing, murdering them. "You can't run, you're an open target running, he was shooting anyone on their feet as well as people on sun loungers, he was just killing them. "So we both at the same time, [said] play dead, we just fell to the ground, faces in the sand. "The shooting continued. He just kept on shooting, it was coming nearer and nearer. Then his feet were at the side of me. "You don't move, because you're next. You just pray to God. "Then there was this noise, this heavy clicking noise, into the sand fell part of the gun, a magazine... You still have to pretend you're dead. "And then click again. He put more bullets in. "And then there was a noise. I don't know what noise, just a noise. I could feel him move and the shooting started again." Ms Evans, from King's Lynn in Norfolk, described hearing the gunman leave the beach towards a hotel. When the pair thought it was safe, they ran to another hotel. She said staff there hid her and her friend in an office until it was over. Shot Welshman 'was human shield' Saera Wilson said her fiance Matthew James, 30, from Trehafod, near Pontypridd, was trying to protect her during the gunfire and used his body as a human shield. Ms Wilson, 26, said Mr James was hit in the shoulder, chest and hip. Speaking from the hospital where Mr James, known as Sas, is being treated, Ms Wilson said: "He took a bullet for me. I owe him my life because he threw himself in front of me when the shooting started. "He was covered in blood from the shots, but he just told me to run away." 'We just ran' Shelley Hay, 25, and Ben Milton, 24, from Cardiff, were on the beach with sunbathers when the attack began. Ms Hay told the BBC: "I heard what I thought were fireworks and looked to the left of me and the whole beach was running, it was like a stampede. "I have never seen anything like it in my life. There were shots - from what I know now as I could see sand flying in the air - I believe it was bullets hitting the floor and the sand was just hitting back, so we just ran." The couple got engaged hours later. Mr Milton proposed after deciding to "not let them stop me." 'Frightened? It's unbelievable!' Fourteen-year-old Bronwyn Slater was in the sea with her mum when the gunman began firing. "We just heard these sounds like bang, bang, bang bang. We just proper ran to my dad. It were terror and shock and sorrow. Then I had to proper sprint for my life really, to survive," she told the BBC. The three of them ran to a shop where they hid in a cupboard for two-and-a-half hours, listening to gun shots and hand grenades being detonated on either side of them. It must have been frightening, said BBC Today presenter John Humphrys. "Frightening? It's unbelievable. It's shocking as well and terrifying really," said Bronwyn. Listen to the full interview on BBC Radio Four's Today programme 'I hid in hotel laundry' One survivor has spoken about how he was hidden in a hotel laundry room by hotel staff. John Carter, who was on holiday with his wife Lynn, ran into his hotel's kitchen area after hearing gunfire and was hidden in the laundry room. Mr Carter, from Hull said he lost sight of his wife after stopping briefly to urge an older man to run. "Then there were big explosions and then gunshots," he said. "You didn't know what was going on, and you just saw some legs under where we were hid and they were shouting at them to get in with us, and then someone fell on top of me and it was my wife." 'We thought it was the end' Couple Becky Catterick, 19, and Mark Barlow, 24, from Scunthorpe were protected from the gunman by local shopkeepers. Miss Catterick said: "We didn't want to say goodbye, but he just kept getting closer so we just all told each other we loved each other." "We thought it was the end," Mr Barlow added. Staff 'prepared to take bullets' Jac Randell, from Cardiff, was on holiday in the resort of Sousse with his partner Hollie Nicklin when the gunman opened fire on Friday. Mr Randell said they ran from the attacker expecting to get shot in the back. "Hotel staff formed a line of protection around the hotel. They were prepared to take the bullets for us. You can't thank them enough," he said. 'I kissed my wife goodbye' One British tourist in Tunisia, whose name was only given as Danny, took refuge under a table with his wife, hearing ''guns and grenades and explosions'' around them. ''I hid under a table and kissed my wife goodbye, thinking that was going to be the end'' he said. Listen to his story 'They're inside - run' A couple from Manchester told the BBC that the gunman was "killed about 400 yards" from where they were hiding. Olivia Leathley, who was on holiday in Sousse, said she saw "hundreds of people running and screaming from the beach," before she managed to hide with her boyfriend, Mike Jones, in a small security lodge. 'Everyone was running' Melanie Callaway, 45, from Hedge End, Hampshire had just been in the sea with her friend Paula Gill, 48, when the shooting started. "It was absolutely manic - people were just screaming 'run for your life', 'get off the beach - just run'. It was like a tsunami film where everyone was just running up the beach towards their hotels. "We had a five-minute run up the footpath with no shoes on," said Mrs Callaway. The pair barricaded themselves in their room in the Royal Kenz Hotel for five hours with a mattress pushed up against the door. 'Run, there's a gun' Debbie Horsfall was on holiday in Tunisia and flew back on Saturday morning. She described to the BBC how her friend noticed the gunman, and raised the alarm by shouting ''run, there's a gun''. 'We feared for our lives' Graeme Scott, from Irchester, Northamptonshire, was in the Hotel Imperial Marharba with his parents Jen and Sid and cousin Karl when the Tunisian beach attack happened. "We were laying by the pool and suddenly there were gunshots - what I thought were gunshots - but dad turned round and said 'it's fire crackers'. "I said 'no dad it's gunshots, we have got to go'. So we all got up... and we just headed towards the foyer of the hotel. "We just wanted to get safe somewhere. "There was about 20 of us in the cellar room with the door shut just for safety and we had to just keep quiet. "We just feared for our lives." Listen to the full interview with BBC Radio Northampton 'Pandemonium' Belfast couple Robert McKenzie and his wife, Wilma, had just come out of the sea when the gunman opened fire. The couple were staying at a hotel about 300 yards from where the shooting happened. Mr McKenzie said "pandemonium" broke out. "Everyone was running. I hadn't heard any gunfire," he said. "If they had come to our section of the beach, we'd have been wiped out because we always lay right at the front of the beach... and wouldn't have had a chance, quite honestly. "By the grace of God, it didn't happen to us."
In a statement, it said the trio, Li Dongsheng, Jiang Jiemin and Wang Yongchun, were accused of bribe-taking. Mr Li and Mr Jiang were said to have been allies of Mr Zhou, China's once-powerful head of domestic security. Mr Zhou is widely believed to be under investigation for corruption, although nothing has been formally confirmed. A probe into the former Politburo Standing Committee member would mark the first time such a high-ranking figure had been targeted. Mr Zhou retired in late 2012 after a career that saw him head both China's Ministry of Public Security and its largest energy company, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). Several individuals believed to have had close ties to him have been targeted for investigation in recent months. Oil link The three men named by the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP), the top prosecutor's office, were already known to be under scrutiny. Mr Li, a former vice-minister for security, was sacked in February for "serious disciplinary violations". An investigation into Mr Jiang, the head of the commission that oversees state-owned companies and a former head of CNPC, was announced in September 2013. Mr Wang, a top official at CNPC and a reported ally of Mr Jiang, was placed under investigation in August 2013. Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to crack down on corruption when he took power, warning that endemic graft threatened the survival of the Communist Party. The news that yet more of Mr Zhou's associates are being formally investigated will be seen as the latest move to isolate him, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Until two years ago he was one of the country's most powerful and feared politicians, but he has not been seen in public for months and is now believed to be under house arrest. Speculation is growing that Mr Zhou will be the highest-ranked official to be charged as part of Mr Xi's crackdown. Such a move would send shockwaves through the ruling elite, who are generally considered off-limits. But it would also be taken as a sign that Mr Xi had consolidated power and was confident enough to take on opposing political factions, our correspondent adds.
Extra security checks came in at some UK airports last week for flights to the US, but these will now be extended. The government says the checks apply to unspecified flights to and from the UK. It comes after an apparent terror threat prompted the US to announce extra security checks last week. But the Department for Transport (DfT) has now issued updated guidelines, saying: "In line with the US advice, passengers on some routes into and out of the UK may now also be required to show that electronic devices in their hand luggage are powered up or face not being allowed to bring the device onto the aircraft. "Passengers flying into or out of the UK are therefore advised to make sure electronic devices being carried in their hand luggage are charged before they travel." The department said that "for obvious reasons" it would not elaborate on the routes affected. "We will work with the aviation industry to minimise disruption as far as possible," said a spokesman. At the scene The BBC's Lyndsey Telford at Heathrow It's business as usual at Heathrow as countless passengers stream through security, bound for flights all over the world. Most seem unfazed by the ramped up measures and have come prepared, with only a handful at a cafe at Terminal 3 using the wall socket charging points to give their laptops, phones and tablets that last boost of power. Matt Bowdidge, who is flying home to Brisbane, Australia, has his gadgets and wires strewn across a table as he finishes his coffee before heading for security. "I want to make sure it's all fully charged," he says. "But it's no big deal. No one likes a lot of hassle when they travel, but I would rather turn on my phone and laptop for security than be blown up in the sky." It seems this is the general consensus. And as Vladimir Durovcik, who is flying to Vienna, said: "We're all one civilisation and we do what we can, no matter how small, to make sure we are all safe." 'Terror organisations' As well as mobile phones and laptops, the guidance set out by the DfT also includes a range of other electronic devices such as electrical shavers, travel irons, hairdryers, hair-straighteners and cameras or any other camera equipment. Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said the tightening of security measures at airports reflected "the fact that there are terror organisations that seek to do UK citizens, the UK and citizens of other countries harm". UK Airport security 228m passengers on international flights to and from the UK per year 91% people over 16 use a mobile phone in the UK 20,000 fly daily from Heathrow to the US 4,500 charging points at Heathrow 40+ UK airports fly to international destinations American officials ordered some overseas airports with direct flights to the US to intensify screening of electronic devices last week. This prompted Heathrow and Manchester airports to advise US-bound passengers to charge electronic devices to be carried as hand baggage before travelling on Monday. British Airways said customers with uncharged devices would not be allowed to fly and would have to rebook their flights or else leave their device behind and board their flight without it. It said these passengers will either be able to collect the device on their return or have it forwarded to another address, at the airline's expense. Virgin Atlantic said it would also store uncharged devices for customers at the airport. But after initially saying the cost of returning devices rested with passengers, the airline later revised its decision and said passengers would not be charged. Meanwhile, EasyJet said it was seeking clarification from government on the new regulations and had not, so far, issued any specific instructions to passengers. Analysis By Richard Westcott, Transport Correspondent The government has to keep everything deliberately vague because it doesn't want to give away any secrets to terrorists. So we simply don't know which routes are being scrutinised, which devices they are worried about, which airports are beefing up their checks, and so on. Instead, we've ended up with some blanket advice about US flights last week that has now been changed again today. My understanding is that this won't cause huge queues at security. They're unlikely to check your stuff if you're on a domestic flight or you're popping to France or Spain for your holidays. You may remember the chaos when they banned liquids in 2006; this won't be anything like that. In the end, if you stick to this rule, you'll be fine. If you're getting on a plane today, make sure anything with a battery has some charge in it. And carry your charger in your hand luggage just in case. Although the DfT said "some routes" into and out of the UK would be affected, specific details have not been released. The travel editor of the Independent newspaper, Simon Calder, said: "I think it's extremely unlikely that a charter flight from Manchester to Malaga or from Glasgow to Crete is going to be targeted by the DfT for scrutiny. "I can see however that flights to and from places with a recent history of terrorism - and I'm thinking here of maybe Egypt, maybe Kenya - there could well be added scrutiny for those flights." He said an average of 20,000 people travelled from the UK to the US per day but warned that the approaching summer holiday season would increase numbers. Airport security checks: Key questions answered What are the new restrictions on charging devices? Airline passengers entering and leaving the UK on potentially any route must be able to prove electronic and electrical devices in their hand luggage are sufficiently charged to be switched on when they get to security. What gadgets are included? The general advice applies to anything "with a battery", including mobile phones, MP3 players, electrical shavers, hair-straighteners, travel irons and cameras. What will happen if a device is not charged? Travellers with uncharged devices face having to rebook their flight. Alternatively they may be able to charge their device, post their device or leave it at the airport. Read more: What can you take on a plane? 'Credible' terror threat In a written parliamentary statement, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said the country faced "a constantly evolving threat from terrorism". He said there was no change to the UK terror threat level, which remained at "substantial". US officials said last week they were aware of a "credible" terrorist threat, but have not linked the security changes to any specific intelligence. Analysts have suggested the action could be a response to efforts by Islamic militants in Syria and Yemen to build bombs that evade airport security checks.
In an article published to mark his 87th birthday, Fidel Castro said he didn't expect to survive the stomach ailment and live for so long. "I was far from imagining that my life would extend for another seven years." Mr Castro had been in power since the Cuban Revolution in 1959. The long article was only published by official newspaper Granma on Wednesday, a day after his birthday. Mr Castro left office for treatment in 2006 but only formally resigned as commander-in-chief and president of Cuba in February 2008. "As soon as I understood that it would be definitive, I did not hesitate to cease my charges as president," he said in the article. 'Free AK rifles' Mr Castro also revealed that Cuba had received weapons from North Korea in the early 1980s. The North Korean weapons shipment was provided after Soviet leader Yuri Andropov warned that his country was no longer prepared to step in to defend the communist-run island. "He told us that if we were attacked by the United States we would have to fight alone," wrote Mr Castro. The Soviet Union renewed its commitment, however, to continue providing weapons to the island. But Cuba decided to gather weapons from "other friends" to arm "one million Cuban fighters." "Comrade Kim Il Sung, a veteran and exemplary soldier, sent us 100,000 AK rifles and accompanying ammunition without charging a penny," writes Mr Castro. The North Korean leader, who was succeeded by his son, died in 1994. The revelations come as a team of United Nations experts investigate an incident in the Panama Canal involving a North Korean ship carrying an undeclared shipment of weapons from Cuba. The ship was seized last month on suspicion of carrying drugs, but Panamanian officials found weapons - including two Soviet-era combat jets - stashed under bags of sugar. Cuba came forward saying the "obsolete weapons" were being sent to North Korea to be repaired. Panama called in the UN to investigate if the shipment breached sanctions imposed on North Korea over its nuclear programme.
Public borrowing dropped to £10.5bn last month, down £0.9bn from a year earlier, although analysts had expected the figure to fall further to £10bn. Borrowing in the current financial year to date (April to August) has reached £33.8bn, which is £4.9bn lower than the same point last year. The ONS added there was no clear sign of the Brexit vote affecting figures. Chancellor Philip Hammond has said he may have to reset fiscal policy to offset any negative outcome from the vote. However, he has dampened down talk that he might reveal an increase in public spending when he reveals his Autumn Statement in November. The ONS said receipts from income and corporation taxes rose strongly compared with a year ago, but VAT receipts rose at their slowest annual pace since March 2015. 'Mixed news' Independent research company Capital Economics said the improvement in public finances "was unlikely to last". Scott Bowman, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: "The improvement in the UK public finances in August was partly due to one-off timing factors and is unlikely to continue due to the economic slowdown as a result of the Brexit vote. "The effect of the apparent slowdown in GDP growth since the vote will instead hit the public finances in coming months." In March's Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimated that the government would borrow £55.5bn in the current financial year Howard Archer from IHS Global Insight said the latest borrowing figures were "mixed news" for Mr Hammond. "On the positive side, this adds to the evidence that the economy has been resilient so far following June's Brexit vote, with tax receipts holding up relatively well overall. "Nevertheless, the public finances are still off track to meet the March Budget target, which highlights the fact that the chancellor really has limited ability to provide a boost to the economy in November's Autumn Statement if he is to maintain a semblance of fiscal discipline."
First Lady Rosario Murillo already has a prominent role as the chief government spokeswoman and is widely seen as sharing power with her husband. She appears on Nicaraguan television almost every day. Critics accuse the first couple of running Nicaragua - which has elections in November - like a personal fiefdom. Power couples: Ten presidential spouses who ran for political office While President Ortega rarely speaks to the media, his wife is regularly seen on TV discussing policy and promoting her own brand of New Age spirituality. Mother of the president's seven children, she is fluent in English and French in addition to being a renowned poet. She also has a reputation for wearing colourfully extravagant outfits and jewellery more commonly seen in the hippy 1960s. Correspondents say many Nicaraguans see Ms Murillo as wielding the most power in her country because of her higher public profile. Husband and wife officially submitted their candidacy papers in the capital Managua, accompanied by the legal adviser of their Sandinista party. Hundreds of Sandinista supporters cheered the couple when they left the building. But opposition supporters are concerned her promotion may herald the rise of a new family dynasty in the impoverished Central American nation. Mr Ortega, 70, is a former left-wing guerrilla who formed part of the government junta following the Sandinista revolution against the dictatorship of the Somoza family, which ruled Nicaragua for four decades. The Cuban-inspired Sandinistas seized power in 1979. The party lost elections in the 1990s, but Mr Ortega returned to power in January 2007, after a successful election campaign.
The men were convicted over the deaths of at least 11 officers in Kerdasa. The attack took place after Egyptian military forces cracked down on Islamist supporters of ousted President Mohammed Morsi that July. Hundreds of death sentences have been passed on Mr Morsi's supporters but none has been carried out. Human rights group Amnesty International says the death sentences follow grossly unfair trials and highlight Egypt's disregard for national and international law. Mr Morsi will face a new espionage trial on 15 February, Egypt's official Mena news agency says. He and 10 others will be charged with leaking "classified documents" to Qatar and Qatari-based broadcaster al-Jazeera. Mr Morsi is already facing three other trials, including another case of espionage. He too could be given the death penalty if found guilty. Appeal still possible More than 140 of the 188 defendants in the Kerdasa case are already in custody, while the rest have been sentenced in absentia. The court also sentenced a minor to 10 years in prison in the case, and two other defendants were acquitted. The verdict follows a recommendation by Egypt's top religious authority, the Grand Mufti, but it can be appealed against. Last month, the death sentences of 37 people were overturned on appeal. The defendants had been convicted of attacking a police station in Minya, south of Cairo, on the same day as the Kerdasa attack. The violence came after security forces killed hundreds of people when they cleared protest camps set up in the capital by supporters of the ousted Islamist president, Mohammad Morsi. The original trial also saw some 377 people sentenced to life in prison in absentia. "[The] death sentences are yet another example of the bias of the Egyptian criminal justice system," Amnesty's Deputy Middle East and North Africa Programme Director, Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, said in a statement in response to Monday's verdict. "These verdicts and sentences must be quashed and all of those convicted should be given a trial that meets international standards of fairness and excludes the death penalty." Mr Sahraoui said it would be wrong to impose capital punishment "when there are serious doubts hanging over the fairness of the trial" which "outrageously flouted" international law. The United Nations has called the mass trials "unprecedented". Mr Morsi was succeeded by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi, a former military chief who has been heavily criticised for his crackdown on Islamists. Hundreds of people, mostly Islamists, have been killed since the army deposed Mr Morsi.
BBC TrendingGoing in-depth on social media Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) are attempting to access the previously rebel-held town of Douma, where medical organisations and rescue workers say President Bashar al-Assad's forces dropped bombs filled with toxic chemicals in an attack on 7 April, killing more than 40 people. The Syrian government and its key ally, Russia, say the incident was staged. But the US, UK and France - who support the opposition to Mr Assad - say they are confident that chlorine and possibly a nerve agent were used. Despite the uncertainty about what happened in Douma, a cluster of influential social media activists is certain that it knows what occurred on 7 April. They've seized on a theory being floated by Russian officials and state-owned media outlets that the attacks were "staged" or were a "false flag" operation, carried out by jihadist groups or spies in order to put the blame on the Assad government and provide a justification for Western intervention. The group includes activists and people who call themselves "independent journalists", and several have Twitter followings reaching into the tens or hundreds of thousands. You may also be interested in: The activists call themselves "anti-war", but as they generally back the Syrian government's military operations against rebel forces seeking to overthrow Mr Assad and Russian air strikes carried out in support, it might be more accurate to describe them as "anti-Western intervention" or "pro-Syrian government". According to their narrative, international media organisations across the political spectrum, along with human rights organisations, are somehow covertly aligned with Western governments, Saudi Arabia, the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda and taking part in a secretive plot to take over Syria. The network of activists includes people like Vanessa Beeley. She has more than 30,000 Twitter followers and writes for a news outlet that the website Media Bias/Fact Check calls a "conspiracy and conjecture site" that has "an extreme right bias". In response to a list of questions, she called BBC Trending's story a "blatant attempt" to "silence independent journalism" and repeated unsubstantiated claims about alleged chemical weapons attacks. Influential accounts Beeley gives talks to fringe groups and makes appearances on media outlets including state-owned Russian channel RT. But in the online conversation about Syria there are more influential activists, about whom much less is known. Sarah Abdallah (@sahouraxo on Twitter) has more than 125,000 followers, among them more than 250 journalists from mainstream media outlets. Her follower count is comparable to BBC journalists who regularly report on Syria, such as BBC Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen (167,000) and BBC Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet (142,000). More from Trending: In addition to pictures of herself, Sarah Abdallah tweets constant pro-Russia and pro-Assad messages, with a dollop of retweeting mostly aimed at attacking Barack Obama, other US Democrats and Saudi Arabia. In her Twitter profile she describes herself as an "Independent Lebanese geopolitical commentator" but she has almost no online presence or published stories or writing away from social media platforms. A personal blog linked to by her account has no posts. Her tweets have been quoted by mainstream news outlets, but a Google News search indicates that she has not written any articles in either English or Arabic. She refused to comment several times when approached by BBC Trending and did not respond to specific requests to comment on this story in particular. White Helmets The Sarah Abdallah account is, according to a recent study by the online research firm Graphika, one of the most influential social media accounts in the online conversation about Syria, and specifically in pushing misinformation about a 2017 chemical weapons attack and the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the "White Helmets". The White Helmets operate in rebel-held areas. They have been one of the sources that Western media outlets, including the BBC, have quoted about alleged chemical attacks in Syria. With regard to the incident in Douma, the BBC has not been able independently to verify the group's reports. Graphika chief executive John Kelly says his company's analysis showed distinct patterns emerging. "When you're looking at these disinformation campaigns, a lot of the same characters show up for every party," he told BBC Trending. Graphika was commissioned to prepare a report on online chatter by The Syria Campaign, a UK-based advocacy group organisation which campaigns for a democratic future for Syria and supports the White Helmets. The White Helmets have been the subject of two Oscar-nominated documentary films and have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Graphika found 20 million messages about the White Helmets, split between tweets in support and in opposition. Among the opponents, Kelly says, Sarah Abdallah was "by far the most influential", followed by Vanessa Beeley. The firm found that Sarah Abdallah's account was primarily followed by a number of different interest clusters: supporters of pro-Palestinian causes, Russians and Russian allies, white nationalists and those from the extremist alt-right, conservative American Trump supporters, far-right groups in Europe and conspiracy theorists. These groups were instrumental in making the hashtag #SyriaHoax trend after the chemical weapons attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017. That hashtag, pushed by Sarah Abdallah and influential American conservative activists, became a worldwide trend on Twitter. Many of those tweeting it claimed that the chemical weapons attack was faked or a hoax. Beeley said the 2017 attack had "been debunked by a number of highly respected analysts and experts." She alleged that evidence "points to the White Helmets as a propaganda construct" and asked, via email: "Why has the BBC never carried out an investigation into the White Helmets?" Experts from a joint UN-OPCW mission said in October 2017 that they were confident a Syrian Air Force jet dropped munitions containing sarin on Khan Sheikhoun, dismissing statements from Russia that the jet had fired conventional munitions at a rebel chemical weapons depot. Drowned out The difficulty in reporting on the ground in Syria has opened up an information vacuum which has been partially filled by highly partisan sources, according to Scott Lucas, a professor of international politics at the University of Birmingham and editor of news and analysis site EA Worldview, "None of it is journalism; none of it is really based on solid independent reporting," Lucas says. "It is absolutely right to question all narratives, including official narratives of what is happening," he says. "The key is that you don't actually start with a narrative, you start with the facts and you establish what may not be true and what may even be disinformation. "The danger we face is, unreliable information is now being taken up by more established - and what we would think of as - more reliable outlets," he says. Syria 'chemical attack': What we know And although the activists' follower accounts continue to grow, there is one indication that their influence online might be on the decline compared with last year. In the hours after the alleged attack in Douma, "Syria" was a top trending term on Twitter, but the messages by pro-Assad activists were drowned out by reports from a range of news outlets. The hashtag #SyriaHoax was used around 17,000 times in a week (compared to more than 280,000 times in April 2017), and mostly failed to make Twitter's lists of top trends. Do you have a story for us?

The Games organising committee said there were too many doubts over the emblem for it to be used. A Belgian artist had complained that his design was stolen. Logo designer Kenjiro Sano had admitted copying online material for a previous project, Japanese media reported. In July, a new Olympic stadium design was scrapped amid a row over its cost. The logo was unveiled only last month, based around the letter T and a red circle representing a beating heart - which critics said resembled the Japanese flag. Its withdrawal is a highly unusual move. "We're certain the two logos are different," Toshio Muto, director general of the Tokyo organising committee, told a news conference. "But we became aware of new things this weekend and there was a sense of crisis that we thought could not be ignored. "We have reached a conclusion that it would be only appropriate for us to drop the logo and develop a new emblem. At this point, we have decided that the logo cannot gain public support." Belgian designer Olivier Debie claimed that the design was similar to his 2013 logo for the Theatre de Liege. He and the theatre had filed a lawsuit to prevent it being used. Mr Debie expressed surprise at the organisers' decision on Tuesday as they had publicly backed the design only days earlier. He told BBC Radio 5 live: "I thought the Olympic committee was a big machine and I didn't dare to take action against them." But the director of the Theatre de Liege had told him they had to "do something" and they sought the help of good copyright lawyers. He said the logo, devised in 2011, had been official for two years and would have been available on sites like Pinterest around the world. While Kenjiro Sano has denied plagiarising the logo, he has admitted his team did copy other work for a beer promotion and faces several other accusations of plagiarism. "I want Mr Sano to provide an explanation. I feel like we have been betrayed," said Tokyo Governor Yoichi Masuzoe. Japan was seen as a safe pair of hands to host the Olympics, but Tuesday's developments cap an awkward month for the organisers. The stadium delay means it will not be ready for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. A promise to keep most venues within eight kilometres (five miles) of the Olympic Village has also not been kept. There may also be repercussions for lucrative sponsorship deals as Japan Airlines and other sponsors have already started using the logo. Organisers say there will be another competition to decide a new logo "as soon as possible".
Mr Macron told the Financial Times it was "naive" to suggest China had dealt better with the crisis, adding things "happened that we don't know about". More people have died in the US and several European countries than in China where the virus emerged. The US and the UK have also cast doubt on China's figures and the speed with which it responded or alerted others. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) has praised China's measures. Worldwide, more than two million people have been infected and more than 145,000 have died. The US,France, Italy and Spain are amongst the worst affected countries. What's behind this French-Chinese confrontation? France has seen 141,000 cases of Covid-19 and nearly 18,000 deaths. China has recorded 4,632 deaths - including an extra 1,290 deaths announced on Friday in the city of Wuhan, where the pandemic started and where a strict lockdown has only recently been lifted. Local officials said early reporting there had been delayed and inaccurate. President Macron's interview came after a weekend of tension which saw the summoning of the Chinese ambassador to Paris by the French foreign ministry to express disapproval over an article on the Chinese embassy's website that said Western countries had left the elderly to die in care homes. The article - by an unnamed diplomat - was seen by France as a reference to the situation in its care homes, which make up a large number of deaths attributed to the disease caused by coronavirus, Covid-19. China dismissed the row as a "misunderstanding". Government spokesman Zhao Lijian said China had never made any negative comments about how France was coping with the epidemic "and has no intention of making any". Mr Macron was asked if China's authoritarian response to bring the outbreak under control had exposed the weakness of Western democracies, and responded that there was no comparison between open societies and those where truth was suppressed. "Given these differences, the choices made and what China is today, which I respect, let's not be so naive as to say it's been much better at handling this," he said. "We don't know. There are clearly things that have happened that we don't know about." He said that abandoning freedoms to fight the pandemic would threaten Western democracies. "We can't accept that. You can't abandon your fundamental DNA on the grounds that there is a health crisis." What is China being accused of? Many Western officials are coming under pressure to explain why the coronavirus outbreak is wreaking havoc on their populations - proportionally much smaller than China's. The UK and the US have led the charge that China's figures and explanations cannot be trusted. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told a news conference on Thursday that "hard questions" would have be asked about how the outbreak started "and how it couldn't have been stopped earlier". He said there would have to be a "deep dive" into how the virus was able to spread from China and said it could not be "business as usual" after the crisis. US President Donald Trump has also taken a harder line against China. On Wednesday, asked why the US accounted for such a high proportion of the global death toll, he responded: "Does anybody really believe the numbers of some of these countries?" he said, naming China. He said the US was also looking into unverified reports that the coronavirus may have emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan rather than in a market in the city. Fox News in the US, citing unnamed sources, has suggested that the coronavirus accidentally leaked from a Wuhan facility because of lax safety protocols. The Washington Post newspaper has reported information obtained from diplomatic cables. They show that, in 2018, US science diplomats were sent on repeated visits to a Chinese research facility. Officials sent two warnings to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab. US intelligence agencies have taken an interest, the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Mark Milley said on Tuesday. "We've had a lot of intelligence look at that. And I would just say at this point, it's inconclusive, although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural. But we don't know for certain." There is no evidence of any kind that the Sars-CoV-2 virus was released accidentally from a lab, says the BBC's science editor Paul Rincon. One online theory, that went viral in January, suggested the virus could have been engineered in a lab as a bioweapon. This allegation has been repeatedly dismissed by scientists, who note that studies show the virus originated in animals - most likely in bats.
Debbie Martin passed away at the Palomar Medical Centre in Escondido on Sunday, aged 61, the hospital said. Mrs Martin was the sister of Jolie's mother Marcheline Bertrand, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007, aged 56. Her husband, Ron Martin, said the sisters had both had the same mutated BRCA1 gene, which Jolie inherited. "Angelina has been in touch throughout the week and her brother Jamie has been with us, giving his support day by day," he told E! News. "They both loved Debbie very much and although Angie is not able to come right now, she has sent her love and support, which was very nice." Mr Martin also praised the actress for electing to have a double mastectomy, telling the Associated Press: "Had we known, we certainly would have done exactly what Angelina did." On 14 May, the 37-year-old wrote in the New York Times that she had had the operation after doctors estimated she had an 87% risk of breast cancer and a 50% risk of ovarian cancer. "I decided to be proactive and to minimise the risk as much I could," she explained, adding that her chances of developing breast cancer had now dropped to less than 5%. The BRCA1 gene is present in everyone but only mutates in one in 1,000 people. Anyone with the mutation has a 50-80% chance of developing breast cancer.
Twenty-two of the most expensive coins will be struck containing a kilogramme of fine gold each. A range of coins at different prices is being struck. It is the first time that a royal christening has been marked with coins. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son will be christened on 23 October, just over three months after his birth. The Archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Reverend Justin Welby, will perform the christening at the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace. Lilies The prince, who was born on 22 July at St Mary's Hospital in London, is third in line to the throne. The coins are starting to be struck on Tuesday at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taf. They feature a lily font from the Tower of London, which has links with royal christenings. The inscription is flanked by two harp-playing cherubs. The motto at the foot of the coin is the traditional "Dieu et mon droit" or "God and my right", which is the motto of Prince George's great grandmother, the Queen. The prince has already had coins minted in his honour. The Royal Mint gave away 2,013 silver pennies to babies born on the same day as the duke and duchess's son.
The Court of Appeal refused Mr Assange's attempt to have a detention order issued in 2010 revoked. Mr Assange, who denies the allegations, has sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy in London to avoid extradition. If he goes to Sweden, he fears he could be extradited to the US to face charges of leaking government documents. Wikileaks has published thousands of secret documents, which have caused intense embarrassment for the US and lifted the lid on diplomatic relations. 'No reason' Two women in Sweden accuse Mr Assange, 43, of sexual assault. Thursday's decision at the Svea Court of Appeal in Stockholm ruled on an appeal against a similar decision by a lower court. Mr Assange's lawyers argued that the arrest warrant should be repealed because it could not be enforced while he was in the Ecuadorean embassy. Analysis by BBC World Affairs correspondent Paul Adams Before and during his self-imposed incarceration inside the Ecuadorean embassy, Julian Assange has been trying to clear his name through a whole series of legal hurdles. So far without success. Mr Assange's lawyers have attempted to challenge the legal basis for the allegations against him. But the allegations won't go away and today's ruling, while critical of the prosecution's failure to move the investigation forward, makes it plain that Mr Assange still has a case to answer. It offers no opinion on Mr Assange's claim that he cannot leave the safety of the Ecuadorean embassy without running the risk of being extradited to the United States and jailed for his role in the release of classified American military and diplomatic documents. But the fact remains that no such US extradition request exists. A lengthy grand jury investigation has not apparently resulted in any form of indictment. In 2013, when former NSA contractor Edward Snowden began leaking his own stash of damaging material, the importance of Julian Assange suddenly receded. The lawyers noted that Swedish prosecutors had not travelled to London to interrogate Mr Assange. In a statement, the court said there was "no reason to set aside the detention solely because Julian Assange is in an embassy and the detention order cannot be enforced at present for that reason". But it also criticised Swedish prosecutors for not making enough effort to explore "alternative avenues" to interrogate Mr Assange, saying the "failure of the prosecutors to examine alternative avenues is not in line with their obligation". Per Samuelson, one of Mr Assange's lawyers, told Reuters news agency that he believed the court's comments were a "warning" to prosecutors, and that the warrant would be revoked at a future hearing. He said the defence team would take the ruling to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, prosecutor Marianne Ny said in a statement: "Like the court of appeals says, there is every reason to continue considering how the case should be taken forward." Smear campaign Mr Assange has not been formally charged in Sweden, but prosecutors want to question him over allegations of sexual misconduct and rape involving two women he met during a visit to the Scandinavian country in 2010. The Wikileaks founder denies the allegations and has said they are part of a smear campaign against him. The Ecuadorean government granted asylum to Mr Assange in 2012 after the UK Supreme Court refused to reopen his appeal against extradition. Ecuador says there are fears his human rights might be violated if he is extradited. Chelsea Manning, an American soldier formerly known as Bradley Manning, was sentenced to 35 years in prison in the US for passing documents to Wikileaks. But no US extradition request for Mr Assange exists and a spokeswoman at the US embassy in London said Mr Assange was not currently a person of interest.

Mrs Tindall's husband, rugby player Mike Tindall, was present at the birth of their first child at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the families of both parents were all delighted at the news, Buckingham Palace said. The baby, as yet unnamed, becomes 16th in line for the throne. Mrs Tindall later left the hospital and returned home. Her husband expressed his joy on Twitter: "Thanks so much for all your kind messages. Definitely the best day of my life today, so happy! The girls are both doing great!" In another tweet, he praised hospital staff, writing: "Big thanks to all involved at Gloucester Royal, they were fantastic!" Mr and Mrs Tindall were married at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh in July 2011. The new arrival is the third grandchild of the Princess Royal and her first husband, Mark Phillips - and the Queen and Prince Philip's fourth great-grandchild. The birth follows that of Prince George in July last year to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. In a statement, the Queen's press secretary said: "The Queen, The Duke of Edinburgh, The Princess Royal, Captain Mark Phillips and Mike's parents, Mr Phillip and Mrs Linda Tindall, have been informed and are delighted with the news. "The baby's name will be confirmed in due course." Prime Minister David Cameron said: "It's wonderful news and I'm absolutely delighted for the couple. I know them a little and I know they'll be absolutely devoted and delighted parents, so happy news all round." BBC Royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the couple had chosen an NHS hospital, the Gloucestershire Royal, for the birth. Mrs Tindall, 32, does not hold a royal title and is not referred to as Her Royal Highness. Her daughter will be known as Miss Tindall. The new parents met during England's Rugby World Cup-winning campaign in Australia in 2003. Mr Tindall, 34, a former England rugby star, is now a player-coach at Gloucester. His wife has achieved sporting success in her own right - where she still competes under the name Zara Phillips - winning individual gold in three-day eventing at the World Equestrian Games in Germany in 2006. The title helped her become BBC Sports Personality of the Year later that year, following in the footsteps of her mother, Princess Anne, who won the award in 1971. As a member of the Great Britain eventing team she won a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She is planning to take part in the next Olympic Games, which will be held in Rio in 2016.
By Tim MastersEntertainment and arts correspondent, BBC News The actor, playing the spy for a third time, was the first of the stars to arrive at the Royal Albert Hall for the royal premiere. "It's incredible," Craig told the BBC. "This is my third premiere and this is the biggest and the best." Skyfall is the 23rd official Bond film and marks 50 years of the franchise. Large crowds of people had turned out to cheer the stars on the red carpet, which stretched along the streets around the venue in Kensington, west London. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall attended the screening on Tuesday night, along with stars Dame Judi Dench, Javier Bardem and the film's director Sam Mendes. James Bond received the royal seal of approval earlier this year at the Olympics opening ceremony when Daniel Craig's character appeared in a short film alongside the Queen. Craig said he was "incredibly proud" to be playing the hero created by Ian Fleming, who first appeared on the big screen in Dr No in 1962. "It was the 50th year so we had try and celebrate that," he said. "Sam and I are huge Bond fans and we wanted to make the best Bond movie we could, and he's done a tremendous job." Proceeds from the royal gala are going to charities that help members of Britain's intelligence services. Skyfall sees spy chief M (Dench) battling a crisis with roots in her past, and Bardem playing a villain bent on revenge. Bardem said: "Sam Mendes has done something very challenging which is to mix the flavour of the classic Bond movies with something more modern." Mendes said: "The weirdest thing is that about two weeks ago I was still finishing the movie with about three other people in a dark room - so the big shock is coming out and finding people about to see the movie." Other stars on the red carpet included Ralph Fiennes, who plays a senior government official, Bond girls Naomie Harris and Berenice Marlohe, and Ben Whishaw as the new Q. Whishaw said: "I'm so thrilled to be a part of this phenomenon." Harris, who plays British agent Eve, said she tried to avoid watching the performances of previous Bond girls as she prepared for the role. "I didn't want to be influenced by that. What was much more useful to me was interviewing a former MI6 agent who came along and answered all our questions about what it was like to be a real agent." Marlohe, who plays the mysterious Severine, said on the red carpet: "We filmed the movie a long time ago but suddenly it brings back all the memories, and I feel very moved to be here." Barbara Broccoli, who co-produces the Bond films with Michael G Wilson, said Skyfall was "classic Bond but with a contemporary feel". She added: "We wanted to make a film for the 50th anniversary for the fans and we wanted to make the best Bond ever - we tried real hard so I hope the audiences like at as much as we enjoyed making it." Skyfall has been praised by critics, with some indeed hailing it as the ultimate Bond adventure. The Independent's Geoffrey McNab said: "If not a full-blown triumph, this is certainly one of the best Bonds in recent memory." The Times's Kate Muir called it "a great British bulldog of a movie". All eyes will be on the box office after the film opens on Friday to see if Skyfall can top Daniel Craig's other outings as the secret agent. 2008's Quantum of Solace made £367.4m ($586.1m) worldwide, while Casino Royale (2006) made £372.5m ($594.2m).
By Rebecca MorelleScience Correspondent, BBC News The Living Planet assessment, by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and WWF, suggests that if the trend continues that decline could reach two-thirds among vertebrates by 2020. The figures suggest that animals living in lakes, rivers and wetlands are suffering the biggest losses. Human activity, including habitat loss, wildlife trade, pollution and climate change contributed to the declines. Dr Mike Barrett. head of science and policy at WWF, said: "It's pretty clear under 'business as usual' we will see continued declines in these wildlife populations. But I think now we've reached a point where there isn't really any excuse to let this carry on. "We know what the causes are and we know the scale of the impact that humans are having on nature and on wildlife populations - it really is now down to us to act." However the methodology of the report has been criticised. The Living Planet Report is published every two years and aims to provide an assessment of the state of the world's wildlife. This analysis looked at 3,700 different species of birds, fish, mammals, amphibians and reptiles - about 6% of the total number of vertebrate species in the world. The team collected data from peer-reviewed studies, government statistics and surveys collated by conservation groups and NGOs. Any species with population data going back to 1970, with two or more time points (to show trends) was included in the study. The researchers then analysed how the population sizes had changed over time. Some of this information was weighted to take into account the groups of animals that had a great deal of data (there are many records on Arctic and near Arctic birds, for example) or very little data (tropical amphibians, for example). The report authors said this was to make sure a surplus of information about declines in some animals did not skew the overall picture. The last report, published in 2014, estimated that the world's wildlife populations had halved over the last 40 years. This assessment suggests that the trend has continued: since 1970, populations have declined by an average of 58%. Dr Barrett said some groups of animals had fared worse than others. "We do see particularly strong declines in the freshwater environment - for freshwater species alone, the decline stands at 81% since 1970. This is related to the way water is used and taken out of fresh water systems, and also the fragmentation of freshwater systems through dam building, for example." It also highlighted other species, such as African elephants , which have suffered huge declines in recent years with the increase in poaching, and sharks, which are threatened by overfishing. The researchers conclude that vertebrate populations are declining by an average of 2% each year, and warn that if nothing is done, wildlife populations could fall by 67% (below 1970 levels) by the end of the decade. Dr Robin Freeman, head of ZSL's Indicators & Assessments Unit, said: "But that's assuming things continue as we expect. If pressures - overexploitation, illegal wildlife trade, for example - increase or worsen, then that trend may be worse. "But one of the things I think is most important about these stats, these trends are declines in the number of animals in wildlife populations - they are not extinctions. By and large they are not vanishing, and that presents us with an opportunity to do something about it." However, Living Planet reports have drawn some criticisms. Stuart Pimm, professor of conservation ecology at Duke University in the United States, said that while wildlife was in decline, there were too many gaps in the data to boil population loss down to a single figure. "There are some numbers [in the report] that are sensible, but there are some numbers that are very, very sketchy," he told BBC News. "For example, if you look at where the data comes from, not surprisingly, it is massively skewed towards western Europe. "When you go elsewhere, not only do the data become far fewer, but in practice they become much, much sketchier... there is almost nothing from South America, from tropical Africa, there is not much from the tropics, period. Any time you are trying to mix stuff like that, it is is very very hard to know what the numbers mean. "They're trying to pull this stuff in a blender and spew out a single number.... It's flawed." But Dr Freeman said the team had taken the best data possible from around the world. "It's completely true that in some regions and in some groups, like tropical amphibians for example, we do have a lack of data. But that's because there is a lack of data. "We're confident that the method we are using is the best method to present an overall estimate of population decline. "It's entirely possible that species that aren't being monitored as effectively may be doing much worse - but I'd be very surprised if they were doing much better than we observed.

The new rule bars semiconductor-makers that use US technology and software in chip design from shipping to Huawei without US government permission. It is the latest US action to target Huawei, which US officials view as a national security threat. China threatened to retaliate against US tech firms. The tightened controls come a year after the US moved to cut off Huawei, the world's second largest smart phone maker, from access to US-made semiconductor chips, which form the backbone of most computer and phone systems. In response, the company and others in China accelerated efforts to manufacture such chips domestically. US Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross said that those efforts were "still dependent on US technologies", and accused Huawei of taking steps "to undermine" earlier export controls. "This is not how a responsible corporate citizen behaves," Mr Ross said. "We must amend our rules exploited by Huawei... and prevent US technologies from enabling malign activities contrary to US national security and foreign policy interests." The new US rule, to be published on Friday, applies to foreign-made items, using US technology. It exempts equipment or software made or shipped within the next 120 days - a move meant to limit economic harm. In a background briefing for reporters, the US said officials would consider licence applications to do business with Huawei on a "case by case" basis. "This is a licensing requirement. It does not necessarily mean that things are denied," a senior State Department official said. "We tend to approach Huawei with some concern but this is a measure that gives the US government visibility into what is moving." Also on Friday, the US extended waivers that allow US companies, many of them rural internet providers, to use some kinds of Huawei technology for another 90 days. 'Cut off the relationship' Donald Trump, who is campaigning for re-election in November, has stepped up his attacks on China in recent weeks, blaming it for the spread of Covid-19. This week, he moved to restrict US government pension funds from investing in Chinese companies. He said on Wednesday he could "cut off the whole relationship". The US has said Huawei's technology could be used for spying by the Chinese government. It has pressured allies, including the UK and Germany, to bar Huawei from their networks and sued the company for technology theft and doing business with Iran, in violation of US sanctions. Huawei has contested the US government's claims and said American efforts are likely to backfire, hurting the ability of US tech firms to do business. China on Friday threatened to place US companies on an "unreliable entity list", according to a report in the country's Global Times. Making life difficult As well as putting pressure on its microchip business, the US trade blacklist has made life very difficult for Huawei's smartphone business. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Huawei's handset shipments outside of China had dropped by 35%, threatening its position as the world's second-biggest handset maker. Its latest phones can no longer embed Google Mobile Services, which include important features such as maps and the Google Play app store. Huawei has tried to work its way around this by providing its own Huawei Mobile Services. But its App Gallery is missing a majority of the most-popular apps found on Android in the UK and US. Luckily, Huawei may have found a loophole. It has been re-releasing some of its previous smartphones with ever-so-slightly updated hardware, complete with the Google Mobile Services. Its latest is the P30 Pro New Edition. It looks almost just like the original P30 Pro, which was released before the US trade blacklist. But the New Edition has more memory and storage - and now comes in silver. And because it's technically a P30 Pro, rather than a P40 Pro, it also comes with the full suite of Google services. Huawei says it will be released in the UK on 3 June. How long it can use that work-around remains to be seen.
The film, by Studio Ghibli and famed director Hayao Miyazaki, follows the story of two sisters who encounter Totoro and other forest creatures. Despite the movie's cult following, it has never been publicly shown in China. But many Chinese viewers have already caught it on DVDs or pirated downloads while growing up. The movie is the first Studio Ghibli movie to ever be released in China, which has a strict quota on the number of foreign films. "For China, film will always take a back seat to politics," Stanley Rosen, director at the East Asian Studies Center at the University of Southern California told the BBC, explaining that whether a Japanese film makes it to China often depended on the state of the political relationship. "Right now that relationship has improved significantly and there is a lot of movement on Sino-Japanese co-productions, including in anime." There are lingering feelings of resentment towards Japan in China relating back to their wartime history. Japan occupied China starting in 1931 and millions of Chinese people were killed by the time the war ended in 1945. Mr Rosen says Totoro director Hayao Miyazaki has been publicly critical of Japan's wartime aggressions and that has been viewed favourably in Chinese media. Nostalgic fans in China took to social media to praise the film's long-awaited release. "I can't wait," gushed a fan on the popular Sina Weibo micro-blogging site. "I used to watch it on DVD and I'm starting to feel nostalgic." Other Weibo users shared their feelings upon seeing the Chinese release poster. "I was flooded by a wave of emotions and suddenly felt like a child again," one user said. Another said she was going to take her daughter to watch the film in cinema. Charles Solomon, a lecturer at UCLA's School of Theatre, Film and Television, told the BBC that Ghibli films were already popular in China "for the same reason they're popular across the world". "Their characters have depth and complexity. They are individuals you feel you know and understand and people respond to that," he said. The critically acclaimed animation is one of Japan's most beloved children's films. While some viewers draw parallels with Alice in Wonderland, the 1988 film was said to have been inspired by director Hayao Miyazaki's own experiences growing up. In the film, sisters Satsuki and Mei visit their ailing mother in hospital, echoing a young Mr Miyazaki who watched his mother recover from a severe case of spinal tuberculosis. My Neighbour Totoro is also often celebrated for its "innocence" - there are no villains or fight scenes - and its hand-drawn scenes of idyllic country fields, placing a strong emphasis on cultivating an appreciation for nature. Studio Ghibli: Japan's answer to Disney
Dr Mahathir's accusations of ruling party leaders accepting bribes "warrant police action", a spokesperson said. Dr Mahathir and the Bersih pro-democracy movement have called for current PM Najib Razak to resign over corruption allegations. Tens of thousands attended Bersih's weekend rallies across the country. A spokesman for Dr Mahathir, Sufi Yusoff, told Reuters: "As far as I am aware he has not been approached by the police yet. We will comply with the police on whatever is needed." It was unclear whether Dr Mahathir could face charges. Dr Mahathir delivered a speech on Saturday at the rally in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, where he called for a "people's power" movement to topple Mr Najib, a former ally. Mr Najib has denied all allegations of corruption and has accused Dr Mahathir of mounting a political smear campaign against him. What is 1MDB? Read more: 1MDB, the case that's riveting Malaysia. Dr Mahathir was Malaysia's longest serving prime minister, in office from 1981 to 2003, and remains highly influential. The 90-year-old used to lead Mr Najib's party, Umno. Police Inspector-General Khalid Abu Bakar told reporters that, during his speech at the Bersih rally, Dr Mahathir had made "all sorts of accusations", including one that alleged Umno division chiefs had received bribes. "We want to know further and where he had obtained the information... I hope he will give his co-operation," said Mr Khalid. He added that other prominent figures who attended the officially illegal rally, as well as the organisers, would also be called up for questioning. Mr Najib has repeatedly denied taking money from Malaysia's state investment fund, 1MDB. The anti-corruption agency has effectively cleared him, saying the $700m (£455m) found in his personal accounts came from foreign donations.
Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government believed Sunday's attacks could not have been carried out without help from terror groups abroad. IS claimed the attack on Tuesday, although did not provide evidence. Meanwhile Sri Lanka's president vowed to "completely restructure" state security after the attacks. In a televised address late on Tuesday, Maithripala Sirisena said he plans to change the heads of defence forces "within the next 24 hours". He also admitted threat reports had not been shared with him, and promised to take "stern action" against security officials. What did the prime minister say? Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ). But Mr Wickremesinghe said the attacks "could not have been done just locally". "There had been training given and a coordination which we are not seeing earlier," he said. Police have now detained 40 suspects in connection with the attack, all of whom were Sri Lankan nationals. A state of emergency remains in effect to prevent further attacks. Mr Wickremesinghe said that only Sri Lankan nationals had been arrested in connection with the attack so far, but that some of the attackers may have travelled abroad before the bombings. ''We, certainly the security apparatus, are of the view there are foreign links and some of the evidence points to that. So if the IS (Islamic State) claimed it, we will be following up on this claim," he added. The nearly simultaneous attacks targeted three churches packed for Easter services and three major hotels in the capital, Colombo. An attack on a fourth hotel on Sunday was foiled, Mr Wickremesinghe said. He also warned that further militants and explosives could still be "out there" following the attack. Who could be behind the attacks? IS said it had "targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka" via its Amaq news outlet. It provided no evidence for the claim but shared an image on social media of eight men purported to be behind the attack. The group's last territory fell in March but even then experts had warned it does not mean the end of IS or its ideology. Earlier, the country's defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene told parliament that NTJ was linked to another radical Islamist group he named as JMI. He gave no further details. He also said "preliminary investigations" indicated that the bombings were in retaliation for deadly attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings. The Sri Lankan government is facing scrutiny after it emerged the authorities were warned of about a possible attack. Security services had been monitoring the NTJ but the prime minister and the cabinet were not warned, ministers said. 'Targets in line with IS ideology' Analysis by BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera The Sri Lankan government has said locals from two known groups carried out the attack. But from the start - because of the scale and sophistication of it - they have also said they thought there was an external role. In the past, IS has sometimes claimed attacks that it was not involved in or which it simply inspired. But the details from IS would seem to back up the government's assessment. The choice of targets is much more in line with IS ideology than with the traditional types of communal violence seen in Sri Lanka. There are still questions - did the local men affiliate themselves to IS or receive direct support? Did they travel to Syria or to other countries? The Sri Lankan government has said it believes some of them had spent time abroad, but how significant was that to the plot? Answering questions like these will be important not just for Sri Lanka but other countries as they try and understand whether other relatively small, locally focused groups could be capable of transforming a threat into violence on such a massive scale. Who were the victims? The first mass funeral was held on Tuesday, as Sri Lanka marked an official day of mourning for the victims. Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services. Sri Lankan officials said 38 foreign nationals were among the dead, with another 14 unaccounted for. The death toll includes at least eight British citizens and at least 10 Indian nationals. The mass funeral for about 30 victims took place at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, north of Colombo, which was one of the places targeted in Sunday's blasts. Another funeral service was scheduled for later on Tuesday. A moment of silence was also observed at 08:30 on Tuesday, reflecting the time the first of six bombs detonated. Flags were lowered to half-mast and people, many of them in tears, bowed their heads in respect. Are you in Sri Lanka? Have you been affected by the attacks?

US Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement: "The nature of the conduct at issue and the resultant harm compel this decision." Seventeen of 30 charges against the 20-year-old - including using a weapon of mass destruction to kill - carry the possibility of capital punishment. The bombings killed three and injured more than 260 in April 2013. Mr Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty and no trial date has been set. Prosecutors allege that Mr Tsarnaev and his deceased older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, built and planted two pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the marathon. The brothers lived in the Massachusetts town of Cambridge, home of the prestigious Harvard University, after emigrating to the US in 2002 from the Caucasus region of southern Russia. Officials believe they set off the bombs in retaliation against the US for its military action in Muslim countries. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed during a shootout with police days after the bombing. The younger brother was wounded and was eventually found inside a boat in a residential neighbourhood. Prosecutors allege Mr Tsarnaev wrote about his motivation for the bombing on the inside of the boat. He allegedly wrote the US government was killing "our innocent civilians" and "I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished". Mr Tsarnaev is also charged with killing a university police officer and carjacking. He will be charged under the federal death penalty law; Massachusetts abolished the use of capital punishment in 1984. Since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988, 70 people convicted have been placed on death row. But only three people have actually been executed, including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh in 2001.
Few expected that the little-known vice-president who was elevated to the presidency in the wake of Anwar Sadat's 1981 assassination would hold on to the country's top job for so long. Sadat was assassinated by Islamist militants at a military parade in Cairo, and Mr Mubarak was lucky to escape the shots as he sat next to him. Since then, he has survived at least six assassination attempts - the narrowest escape shortly after his arrival in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, in 1995 to attend an African summit, when his limousine came under attack. Besides his knack for dodging bullets, the former air force commander also managed to keep a hold on power by positioning himself as a trusted Western ally and fighting off a powerful opposition movement at home. It all came to an end in a televised address on 1 February 2011, following mass protests in Cairo and other cities. Mr Mubarak announced he had decided not to stand for re-election later that year. Protests continued and on 10 February he appeared on state television to say he was handing over powers to his vice-president, but would remain as president. The following day Vice-President Omar Suleiman made a terse announcement saying Mr Mubarak was stepping down and the military's supreme council would run the country. 'I have a good conscience' By late May 2011, judicial officials announced that Mr Mubarak, along with his two sons - Alaa and Gamal - would stand trial over the deaths of anti-government protesters. So began a protracted series of court appearances - with the former president often been seen in the dock in an upright stretcher wearing his trademark sunglasses. He has steadfastly argued his innocence - telling a retrial in August that that he was approaching the end of his life "with a good conscience". On 2 June 2012 he was found guilty of complicity in the murder of some of the demonstrators who took part in the wave of protests that began on 25 January 2011. Along with his former Interior Minister, Habib al-Adly, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for his crimes. In January 2013 a court upheld an appeal against Mr Mubarak's and Mr al-Adly's convictions and granted retrials. Mr Mubarak and his sons were also ordered to be retried on corruption charges for which they were originally acquitted. Mr Mubarak was released from prison in August that year but placed under house arrest before being transferred to a military hospital. In May 2014, Mubarak was found guilty of embezzlement, and sentenced to three years in prison. Alaa and Gamal were sentenced to four years each. The convictions were overturned in January 2015, but a retrial reinstated the same sentences. An appeals court upheld the sentences a year later, but Alaa and Gamal were freed because of time already served. In November 2014, Mr Mubarak was finally acquitted in a retrial of conspiring to kill protesters during the 2011 uprising. At the same time, he was also acquitted of corruption charges involving gas exports to Israel. In March 2017 Egypt's top appeals court upheld Mr Mubarak's acquittal and he went free, for the first time in six years. A strict personal life Born in 1928 in a small village in Menofya province near Cairo, Muhammad Hosni Sayyid Mubarak insisted on keeping his private life out of the public domain while president. Married to a half-British graduate of the American University in Cairo, Suzanne Mubarak, he was known to lead a strict life with a fixed daily schedule that began at 0600. Never a smoker or a drinker, he built himself a reputation as a fit man who led a healthy life. In his younger days, close associates often complained of the president's schedule, which began with a workout in the gym or a game of squash. He was sworn in as president on 14 October 1981, eight days after the Sadat assassination. Despite having little popular appeal or international profile at the time, the burly military man used his sponsorship of the issue behind Sadat's killing - peace with Israel - to build up his reputation as an international statesman. Egypt's quasi-military leader In effect, Mr Mubarak ruled as a quasi-military leader when he took power. For his entire period in office, he kept the country under emergency law, giving the state sweeping powers of arrest and curbing basic freedoms. The government argued the draconian regime was necessary to combat Islamist terrorism, which came in waves during the decades of Mr Mubarak's rule - often targeting Egypt's lucrative tourism sector. He presided over a period of domestic stability and economic development that meant most of his fellow countrymen accepted his monopolisation of power. But towards the end of his tenure in power, Mr Mubarak felt for the first time the pressure to encourage democracy, both from within Egypt, and from his most powerful ally, the United States. Many supporters of reform doubted the veteran ruler's sincerity when he said he was all for opening up the political process. Ahead of his declaration that he would not to stand again for the presidency, the US had heaped pressure on him to stand aside, calling for an "orderly transition" of power to a more democratic system. Mr Mubarak won three elections unopposed since 1981, but for his fourth contest in 2005 - after a firm push from the US - he changed the system to allow rival candidates. Critics said the election was heavily weighted in favour of Mr Mubarak and the National Democratic Party (NDP). They accused the Egyptian leader of presiding over a sustained campaign of suppressing 'History will judge me' The length of his time in power, along with his age and possible successors, had all been sensitive subjects in Egypt until the mass protests allowed the Egyptian people to find a voice. People around Mr Mubarak said his health and vigour belied his age - although a couple of health scares served as a reminder of his advancing years. Rumours about the president's health gathered pace when he travelled to Germany in March 2010 for gall bladder surgery. They flared every time he missed a key gathering or disappeared from the media spotlight for any conspicuous length of time. However much Egyptian officials tried to deny them, they kept circulating, with reports in the Israeli and pan-Arab media. The days of mass protests in Egyptian cities prompted Mr Mubarak to finally name a vice-president. On 29 January 2011, intelligence chief Omar Suleiman was elevated to the role in what was seen as an attempt by Mr Mubarak to bolster his support in the military. Two weeks later Mr Mubarak's three-decade rule was over, and in March he was under arrest. In the past, Mr Mubarak had said he would continue to serve Egypt until his last breath. In his speech on 1 February 2011, he said: "This dear nation... is where I lived, I fought for it and defended its soil, sovereignty and interests. On its soil I will die. History will judge me like it did others."
It said this would "not significantly alter" the spread of the virus, which is linked to serious birth defects. In an open letter to the WHO, more than 100 leading scientists had said new findings about Zika made it "unethical" for the Games to go ahead. They also said the global health body should revisit its Zika guidance. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said it sees no reason to delay or move the Games because of the mosquito-borne disease. The outbreak began in Brazil a year ago, but now more than 60 countries and territories have continuing transmission. Between February and April 2016, Brazil's health ministry registered 91,387 likely cases of the Zika virus. The number of babies born with Zika-linked defects stood at 4,908 in April. While Zika's symptoms are mild, in the letter the experts say it causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads and may also cause a rare and sometimes fatal neurological syndrome in adults. The letter is signed by 150 international scientists, doctors and medical ethicists from such institutions as Oxford University and Harvard and Yale universities in the United States. They cite the failure of a mosquito-eradication programme in Brazil, and the country's "weakened" health system as reasons to postpone or move the Olympics in "the name of public health". More on the Zika crisis: Microcephaly: Why it is not the end of the world What you need to know Key questions answered about the virus and its spread Travel advice Countries affected and what you should do The mosquito behind Zika What we know about the insect Abortion dilemma Laws and practices in Catholic Latin America "An unnecessary risk is posed when 500,000 foreign tourists from all countries attend the Games, potentially acquire that strain, and return home to places where it can become endemic," the letter says. The biggest risk, it adds, is if athletes contract the virus and returned home to poor countries that have not yet suffered a Zika outbreak. They also express concern the WHO has a conflict of interest because of its partnership with the IOC. The Rio Olympics are due to take place between 5 and 21 August. In a statement, the WHO, which has declared the Zika virus a global public health emergency, said: "Brazil is one of almost 60 countries and territories which to date report continuing transmission of Zika by mosquitoes. "People continue to travel between these countries and territories for a variety of reasons. The best way to reduce risk of disease is to follow public health travel advice." Several public health experts had previously warned that hundreds of thousands of people arriving in Rio would speed up Zika's spread and lead to the births of brain-damaged babies. But on Thursday, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), whose advice is quoted approvingly in the letter, said the threat did not warrant halting the Games. "There is no public health reason to cancel or delay the Olympics," Dr Tom Frieden said. However, he urged the US to act more quickly to prevent pregnant women contracting Zika, amid congressional deadlock over the release of $1.9bn (£1.3bn) in funding. And virology researcher Oliver Brady, from Oxford University, said the risk was comparatively low because the Olympics would take place during Brazil's winter. "We really think August is about 20 to 40 times lower risk than we see around now or in January where we see these large numbers of cases reported from Rio," he told the BBC. The Olympics have never been moved for public health reasons but Fifa relocated its 2003 Women's World Cup from China to the US because of the Sars epidemic.
He was found guilty of premeditated murder and sexual assault in April, having previously admitted dismembering Ms Wall's body. However, Madsen, 47, argued a life sentence was "disproportionate". But appeals courts judges sided with the earlier decision, saying the case was one of "unusual brutality". The judges sitting at the Eastern High Court also said there were "aggravating circumstances" because the crime was "meticulously planned". Ms Wall, 30, was last seen boarding Madsen's homemade vessel in Copenhagen harbour in August 2017. Her dismembered body was found along the coast 11 days later. Madsen claimed Ms Wall's death was accidental during his trial at Copenhagen City Court, but prosecutors said he had planned to kill her, either by suffocation or cutting her throat. He announced his intention to appeal after judges handed him a life sentence, which equates to an average of 16 years behind bars in Denmark. Betina Hald Engmark, Madsen's lawyer, had asked for the sentence to be reduced to 14 to 16 years. She said they would look carefully at the ruling before deciding whether to take the case to the Supreme Court. What do we know about the murder? Ms Wall had been researching a story about Madsen's venture and was last seen on the evening of 10 August as she departed with him on his self-built 40-tonne submarine, UC3 Nautilus, into waters off Copenhagen. Her boyfriend raised the alarm the next day when she did not return from the trip. Madsen was rescued at sea after his submarine sank the same day. Police believe he deliberately scuttled the vessel. Ms Wall's mutilated torso was spotted by a passing cyclist on 21 August but her head, legs and clothing, placed in weighted-down bags, were not discovered by police divers until 6 October. After his arrest, Madsen gave differing accounts of what had happened on board his submarine. During the opening session of his trial, prosecutors said there was a suspicion that he had "psychopathic tendencies" after investigators discovered films on his computer showing women being tortured and mutilated.
The article said Mr Wen's family members "have controlled assets worth at least $2.7bn (£1.7bn)". A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the report had "ulterior motives". Both the NYT's Chinese and English sites are being blocked inside China, as are references to the report on micro-blogging sites. "Some reports smear China and have ulterior motives," Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said when asked about the story in a daily press briefing. On the blocking, he said the internet was managed "in accordance with laws". Wealth gap In its report, the New York Times said Mr Wen's relatives' holdings included property, insurance and construction firms. "Many relatives of Wen Jiabao, including his son, daughter, younger brother and brother-in-law, have become extraordinarily wealthy during his leadership," the newspaper wrote. "In many cases, the names of the relatives have been hidden behind layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, work colleagues and business partners." The family's investments reportedly spanned several sectors. The newspaper cited one holding as Ping An, an insurance company which it said had benefited from reforms enacted in 2004 by a state body over which Mr Wen had oversight. It said that partnerships controlled by Mr Wen's relatives, along with their friends and colleagues, had bought into the firm before its IPO, or stock market flotation, in 2004, and held as much as $2.2bn in the company in 2007. The newspaper said both the Chinese government and Mr Wen's relatives declined to comment on the investigation, which was based on corporate records from 1992-2012. No holdings were found in Mr Wen's name, it said, nor was it possible "to determine from the documents whether he recused himself from any decisions that might have affected his relatives' holdings, or whether they received preferential treatment on investments". China is sensitive about reports on its leaders, particularly when it comes to their wealth. A growing wealth gap is causing public discontent, as are the frequent corruption scandals involving government officials. When, in June 2012, a Bloomberg investigative report examined the finances of the relatives of president-in-waiting Xi Jinping, the company's website was blocked in China - even though the report said there was no indication of wrongdoing by him or his family. Mr Wen has been the Chinese premier for almost 10 years. He is due to step down in a power transition that begins on 8 November. He is seen as a popular figure with the common touch, and is portrayed in state media as a leader with great concern for the lives of ordinary people. A spokeswoman for New York Times said she hoped that full access to the websites would be "restored shortly" in China. The BBC has also been affected, with the BBC World News channel blocked when a correspondent was asked about the story during a report, and the BBC News website blocked later on Friday. On China's Twitter-like weibo platforms, keywords such as Wen Jiabao and the New York Times are blocked. Mr Wen's name, like most other Chinese leaders, has always been a screened keyword. Some netizens did manage to post the article despite heavy and rapid censorship. A Sina Weibo user tweeted about the article from Kawagoe city in Japan, but his post was removed after 11 minutes. "The Twist Your Waist Times says the best actor has $2.7bn of assets. I just wonder how will he spend it?" asked a Tencent Weibo user registered in the British West Indies territory of the Turks and Caicos Islands. "Twist your waist" in Chinese characters sounds like New York when spoken, while "best actor" refers to Mr Wen, who critics say only pretends to be a people-first leader.
By Ana Nicolaci da Costa Business reporter The US has been embroiled in a tit-for-tat trade battle on several fronts over the past few months. The one that's creating the most interest is the one with China, as the world's two largest economies wrangle for global influence. Some say President Trump is trying to raise pressure on China ahead of key mid-term elections at home in November. In the latest move, China said on Friday that it would levy new tariffs on more than 5,200 US products if the US goes ahead with its latest threat to impose 25% tariffs on $200bn (£152bn) of Chinese goods. Earlier this year, the US also started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium, including from the European Union, Mexico, and Canada. These countries have retaliated. Here are some of the main sectors finding themselves victims of the trade war so far. Cars and motorbikes The car industry seems to have been the most affected so far, with three major automakers recently warning that changes to trade policies are hurting performance. Ford and General Motors lowered profit forecasts for 2018, citing higher steel and aluminium prices caused by new US tariffs. Fiat Chrysler also cut its 2018 revenue outlook after sales in China slumped, as buyers postponed purchases in anticipation of lower car tariffs. In May, China announced that it would cut tariffs on imported cars from 25% to 15% on 1 July in a move seen as an attempt to reduce trade tensions with the US. But shortly after, on 6 July, it increased tariffs on US-made cars to 40% in retaliation to the US's move to tax $34bn of Chinese products. Jaguar Land Rover, the UK's biggest car firm, also recently reported a loss for the first time in three years after sales slowed down in China. Among the reasons, it said many consumers had delayed purchases due to a change in Chinese import duties. European and US car companies are also responding by increasing prices in China. BMW recently said it would raise prices on two of its models from 30 July due to the increased import duty on US-made cars in China. Tesla has also reportedly increased prices on two of its models. However, there has also been a positive impact for China, as Anna-Marie Baisden, head of autos research at Fitch Solutions, points out. "We have seen a number of carmakers, including Tesla, accelerating plans to invest in local production facilities to avoid import tariffs," she says. Other firms in the broader industry are also considering their options. "Ironically some of the hardest-hit companies are American or producing in the US, even though the tariffs imposed by the US are intended to help domestic companies," says Ms Baisden. US motorcyle maker Harley-Davidson plans to shift some production away from the US to avoid the "substantial" burden of European Union tariffs, imposed in retaliation to US duties on steel and aluminium. Food and drink Some companies in the food and drinks industry are also lowering their outlooks and putting up their prices to cope with the new status quo. Tyson Foods recently cut its profit forecast, saying retaliatory duties on US pork and beef exports had lowered US meat prices. US spirits and wine giant Brown-Forman has said it will increase the price of Jack Daniel's and other whiskeys in some European countries, according to media reports. Coca-Cola has also said it will increase prices in North America this year to compensate for higher freight rates and metal prices, according to the Wall Street Journal. Other victims Other companies are seeking to do less business with China as a way of avoiding the tariffs. Toymaker Hasbro is moving more production out of China, US conglomerate Honeywell wants to use more supply chain sources from countries outside China and home furnishing company RH expects to cut the amount of goods sourced from China, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, US equipment maker Caterpillar recently said strong demand had allowed it to hike prices to offset $100m-$200m in higher steel and aluminium costs. World economy The International Monetary Fund says an escalation of the tit-for-tat tariffs could shave 0.5% off global growth by 2020. Separate releases recently showed growth in China's manufacturing sector slowing in July and one measure of US consumer sentiment falling due to tariff concerns, according to media reports. Morgan Stanley estimates that a full-blown escalation of the trade dispute could knock 0.81 percentage points off global gross domestic product. This scenario would involve the US slapping 25% tariffs on all goods from both China and the EU, and them responding with similar measures. The bank said most of the effect from tariff hikes on growth would probably be seen only in 2019. Most of the impact - or almost 80% - would come through a disruption of domestic and international supply chains, the bank added.
The group - headed by Tom Tugendhat, a prominent critic of China's response to the pandemic - aims to "promote debate and fresh thinking". He said the China Research Group would not be "anti-China". It would "explore opportunities to engage with" the country and examine its economic aims, Mr Tugendhat added. "The coronavirus crisis underlines the urgent need for a better understanding of China's place in the world, and our economic and diplomatic engagement with it," said the Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling. "Beijing's long pattern of information suppression has contributed to the unfolding crisis. The (Chinese Communist) Party are now using the current emergency to build influence around the world." 'Falsified data' On Friday, Mr Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, accused the Chinese Communist Party of putting its own survival ahead of that of the survival of people during the coronavirus outbreak. He told Radio 4's the World At One: "The one thing that really marks out the Chinese Communist Party is not that they didn't have sufficient data, but that they deliberately falsified the data." Despite receiving praise for its handling of coronavirus from the World Health Organisation, many, including US President Donald Trump, have accused the Chinese authorities of manipulating information and failing to adequately warn other countries about its deadly nature. Chen Wen, Minister and First Staff Member of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, defended China's response to the initial outbreak in Wuhan, saying the shutdown of the city had reduced the spread to other countries "by 77%". "Chinese people have paid a high price for that," she added. 'Politically motivated' On the alleged spreading of disinformation on the origins of the virus, Ms Chen said it was "maybe as dangerous as the virus itself, if not even more" and that "solidarity" and "cooperation" is the only way to beat the virus. She hit back at calls for an international inquiry into China's handling of coronavirus outbreak, saying it would be "politically motivated" and would not do anybody "any good". Mr Tugendhat said his new group, which includes eight other Tory MPs, including former cabinet minister Damian Green, would attempt to look beyond the pandemic to examine China's long-term economic and diplomatic aims. In reference to the controversy surrounding the government's decision to allow Chinese technology firm Huawei access to the UK's 5G network, the group will look at the consequences of new technology and who owns platforms. It will also examine China's foreign policy, particularly in relation to the world's poorer regions.
She denied false imprisonment and grievous bodily harm after the son, now aged about 40, was found injured and living in squalor. It seems he was only discovered by a relative on Sunday after his mother fell ill and was taken to hospital. He is now undergoing surgery in hospital for his injuries. Police have sealed off the apartment in Haninge, a southern suburb of the capital, to conduct their investigation and are seeking witnesses as they try to piece together what happened. The woman, who is aged 70, is expected to remain in police custody while the investigation continues. If she is found guilty of false imprisonment, police say she could face up to ten years in jail. How was the son found? The relative who discovered the son said she was his sister and had gone to the flat on Sunday evening with her partner after hearing that the mother was in hospital, she told Swedish media. She told Swedish broadcaster SVT she had moved out of the apartment when she was a teenager and had not seen her brother since. As a child, she said, she had tried in vain to raise the alarm over the welfare of the child, who had been removed from school when he was aged 11 or 12. Opening the unlocked door, she said she found the flat in darkness and reeking of urine, decay, dirt and dust. There was no answer when she shouted "hello" so she went in, picking her way through mounds of clutter. Hearing a sound from the kitchen, she saw the man sitting in a dark corner, lit by a lamp on the street outside. Sores covered his legs up to his knees. When he saw her, he stood up and whispered her name again and again. He had lost almost all his teeth and his voice was slurred, she told the paper. Somehow, she said, he had recognised her after all the time that had passed and he was not afraid of her. When the man was taken to hospital, doctors alerted the police and the mother was detained. Stockholm prosecutor Emma Olsson told Reuters news agency the man had required surgery, without giving further details. "The only comment on the time that person has been kind of 'imprisoned' by his mother is: we are sure that it has been for a long period of time," police spokesperson Ola Österling told BBC News. "We don't estimate how many years. That's a part of our investigations now, to get the detailed information about the exact amount of time." What do we know of the relationship? Earlier, SVT quoted the relative - who was not immediately identified as the sister - as saying the mother had felt bad about losing an earlier child at a young age. When she gave birth again, her new son was given the same name. She wanted her dead son back and became over-protective. "I'm just thankful that he got help and is going to survive," the relative told Expressen. Other recent stories from Sweden you may be interested in
The document obtained by a US university describes the 1955 acquisition of the Nevada site for testing of the secret spy plane. It also explains the site's lingering association with UFOs and aliens. The remote patch of desert surrounding Groom Lake was chosen because it was adjacent to a nuclear testing facility. "The U-2 was absolutely top secret," Chris Pocock, a British defence journalist and author of histories of the programme, told the BBC. "They had to hide everything about it." The U-2 plane, developed to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War, is still flown by the US Air Force. Reports of UFOs The document, a secret 1992 internal CIA history of the U-2 programme, was originally declassified in 1998 with heavy redactions. Many of the blacked-out details were revealed this month after a public records request by the National Security Archive at the George Washington University in Washington DC. The site was selected for the U-2 programme in 1955 after an aerial survey by CIA and Air Force staff. According to the history, President Dwight Eisenhower personally signed off on the acquisition. Officials from the CIA, Air Force and Lockheed, the contractor building the U-2, began moving into the facility in July 1955. While a lengthy account of the development of the U-2 spy plane programme, the history also attempts to shed light on the public's fascination with the Area 51 site and its lingering associations with extra-terrestrials and UFOs. It notes that testing of the U-2 plane in the 1950s - at altitudes much higher than commercial aeroplanes then flew - provoked "a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs)". "At this time, no one believed manned flight was possible above 60,000 feet, so no one expected to see an object so high in the sky," note authors Gregory Pedlow and Donald Welzenbach. 'Inclination towards secrecy' The original request for the redacted portions of the history was made in 2005. It was released to the National Security Archive several weeks ago. Jeff Richelson, a senior fellow at the National Security Archive, said the long period of secrecy was notable because of the extent people across the world were already aware of Area 51's existence. Mr Richelson speculates the CIA must have recently made a conscious, deliberate decision to reveal Area 51's existence and origins. "There is a general inclination towards secrecy," he said, and the many US agencies and non-US governments involved in the U-2 programme would have had a say in the declassification process. "As far as I can tell, this is the first time something must have gone to a high-enough level to discuss whether or not to formally acknowledge Area 51's existence," he said
By Duncan LeatherdaleBBC News online Historic castles and cathedrals England is home to hundreds of grand old castles and cathedrals, from St Michael's Mount off the Cornish coast to Bamburgh in Northumberland, and York Minster to London's St Paul's. The Lonely Planet judges said the country's "famous timeless treasures" have remained a constant "amid all the confusion" of "Brexit uncertainties". England was pipped to top-spot in Lonely Planet's Best in Travel 2020 by Bhutan. Quaint villages The quaint country village, with its cobbled streets and stone, thatched houses astride serene streams and babbling brooks, is a staple of England. Having so many picture-perfect places is one of the reasons England is worth a visit, according to Lonely Planet. The top 10 countries in the list were: Stunning seaside "Once the country's first line of defence against invaders, the English coastline these days is a peaceful place where locals and visitors can enjoy more tranquil pursuits," Lonely Planet judges said. "Taking a bracing walk on a windswept pier, eating delicious fish and chips, searching for marine life in rock pools, finding fossils in ancient cliffs, building sandcastles and dolphin-spotting on picturesque beaches are just some of the activities offered by the English seaside." Lonely Planet said the addition of new stretches of the almost 3,000 mile-long England Coast Path in 2020 would allow visitors to "explore beaches and foreshores right up to the water's edge". You might also like: Rolling countryside England is home to 10 national parks and 34 Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), from Cornwall and the Cotswolds, to the North Pennines and Northumberland Coast via the Shropshire Hills and Lincolnshire Wolds. "For a relatively small country, England offers a lot of breath-taking scenery," said Tom Hall, Lonely Planet's vice-president of experience. "It's fantastic to see England scoring so highly with Lonely Planet - and with travellers," said VisitEngland director Andrew Stokes. "It's no surprise it's a favourite global destination with our breath-taking and varied coastline, vibrant cities, stunning countryside, heritage and cultural gems, amazing visitor attractions, enchanting green spaces and outstanding range of quality accommodation. "England truly is packed full of incredible experiences that visitors can only have here." Unmissable experiences While Lonely Planet's judges were wowed by England's overall offerings, they said there were three unmissable experiences. The "magical history tour" that is Northumberland's coast was first with its "dramatic castles", offshore islands featuring puffins and seals and the "spectacular" Holy Island. The Norfolk Coast, an AONB for more than 50 years, is also somewhere not be missed with its expanses of marsh, dunes and clay cliffs. And finally the South West Coast Path "lures hikers with its wonderful walks and photogenic views", the guide said. "If travellers are seeking exhilarating beauty in 2020, England won't disappoint," Mr Hall said. All pictures copyrighted. Related Internet Links Lonely Planet
International Development Secretary Justine Greening made the commitment to the UN's latest crisis appeal at an international "pledging conference for Syria" in Kuwait. She said the scale of suffering caused was "hard to exaggerate". The government said the £600m now pledged was "three times its response to any other humanitarian crisis". Ms Greening said: "Women and children are vulnerable to brutal violence and some have lost everything." The world "cannot ignore what is happening to the Syrian people", she added. "Britain is determined to play its role in helping the 11 million Syrians who continue to suffer as a result of this crisis. "As the situation grows worse, the international community needs to make sure the UN has the resources it needs to help these people." 'Urgent need' The Department for International Development (DfID) said the new funding would "help the UN meet critical humanitarian needs including schooling for Syrian children". The US has promised $380m (£231m) in new contributions while conference host Kuwait has pledged $500m (£204m). A DfID spokeswoman said the previous "largest humanitarian response" from the UK government was £200m for the victims of the 2011 drought in the Horn of Africa. Some £134m was pledged in response to the Pakistan floods of 2010 while £140m of support was given following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Last week, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg responded to Labour pressure to admit 400-500 Syrian refugees by telling MPs the UK had accepted "about 1,500" asylum seekers from Syria. "We have accepted hundreds upon hundreds of individual asylum seekers from Syria, under our international asylum obligations," he said. But Amnesty International criticised Mr Clegg for conflating asylum seekers who have made it to the UK with people in refugee camps in the Middle East. It followed calls from politicians including Conservative minister Lord Howe, UKIP leader Nigel Farage and former Lib Dem leader Menzies Campbell to consider taking refugees fleeing the Syrian civil war. Conservative chairman Grant Shapps has told BBC News that Britain was making a large financial contribution and can "hold its head up high". Heavy fighting Meanwhile, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, speaking at the donor conference, said half of Syria's population - "nearly 9.3 million individuals, urgently need humanitarian aid". It comes after the UN's World Food Programme has said there are reports of malnutrition in areas of Syria either besieged by government forces or cut off by continuing fighting between rival rebel factions. It said children were being caught up in the fighting and urged greater access for aid agencies. Syria's refugee crisis has grown steadily since the start of 2012 and accelerated quickly last year. The UN says about 6.5 million are now displaced inside Syria, with more than 2.3 million registered refugees living across the region in countries like Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan and Iraq. About 20% of these refugees live in camps - the rest have found shelter in other communities. Syria's opposition remains deeply divided and there has recently been heavy fighting between rival factions. The UN says more than 100,000 people have died since the Syrian uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011.
In a statement it said it had seen "a sharp decline" in weekly bookings. It comes as the airline reported a second quarter net loss of 307m Malaysian ringgit ($97.4m; £58.7m) for the three months to June. The airline has been affected by the crash of flight MH17 in Ukraine and the disappearance of flight MH370. "We expected the impact of MH370 on the performance in Quarter 2," said chief executive Ahmad Jauhari Yahya. "Given that, our team put in much hard work and effort to regain market confidence and rebuild sales. Tragically, just as we were beginning to see signs of recovery in all regions, we were dealt the blow of MH17. "The full financial impact of the double tragedies of MH370 and MH17 is expected to hit Malaysia Airlines in the second half of the year," he added. Average weekly bookings declined 33%, with numerous flight cancellations immediately after the MH17 incident, the company said. Flight MH370 disappeared on 8 March on its way to Beijing with 239 people on board while MH17 was shot down in Ukraine on 17 July killing all 298 passengers on board. It is unclear who is responsible for the latter incident. Malaysia Airlines is being taken private by Malaysia's state investment firm Khazanah Nasional. A restructuring announcement from the company is expected on Friday. The company said it operated in a "harsh business environment of stiff competition" and that even before the two tragedies it was "acutely aware" of the need to restructure. It has not made an annual profit since 2010. Media reports suggest as much as 25% of its 19,500 strong workforce could lose their jobs and international routes are likely to be axed. Reuters reported that the company's shares would be suspended ahead of the announcement. 'Brutal changes' The BBC's Russell Padmore pointed out that Malaysia operates 108 aircraft, a similar sized fleet to Singapore Airlines, which is run with 5,000 fewer staff. Over the last nine years, Singapore has enjoyed profits of nearly $9bn, compared to Malaysia's losses of more than a $1bn, he added. Analysts are sceptical as to whether the company can survive as a going concern. "It will be immensely difficult for MAS to recover... they have dug a hole big enough to swallow the entire company," said Shukor Yusof, an analyst with Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. "Unless brutal, structural changes are made, there is no long-term future," he added.
Police said Flanagan, 41, of Roanoke, Virginia, shot himself and later died after the murders on Wednesday. Using the name Bryce Williams, Flanagan had worked as a TV journalist in several southern states for many years. In March 2012, he was hired at WDBJ, the same Roanoke TV station where his victims Alison Parker and Adam Ward worked. Jeffrey Marks, WDBJ's general manager, described Flanagan as unhappy, difficult to work with and always "looking out for people to say things he could take offence to". "Eventually after many incidents of his anger coming to the fore, we dismissed him. He did not take that well,'' Marks explained. He said Flanagan had to be escorted by police out of the station when he was fired after less than a year in post. Behaviour Emails and letters sent to Flanagan by his bosses before he was fired told him to change his behaviour and also advised him to seek medical help. "This is a mandatory referral requiring your compliance," one message from Dan Dennison, then WDBJ news director said. "Failure to comply will result in termination of employment." As police searched for Flanagan on Wednesday morning, more information surfaced. He posted a video of the shooting to his Twitter account - an account which only had tweets two weeks old and included many childhood and other photos. On Twitter, Flanagan also accused one of the murdered reporters of making racist comments and said the other victim complained to human resources about it. ABC News said they had received a "lengthy" fax from someone purporting to be Bryce Williams between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning and had turned it over to the authorities. The broadcaster described the 23-page letter as "rambling" and said the writer described being motivated by previous gunmen in US mass shootings - including those in Columbine and Virginia Tech, but said the "tipping point" was the murder of nine African-Americans in Charleston early this summer. "I've been a human powder keg for a while… just waiting to go BOOM!!!!," he wrote. He suggested on the Twitter account he had modelled as a child and young adult, been a "high paid companion", and was raised as a Jehovah's Witness. Vester Lee Flanagan 2000 Hired as reporter but fired same year by WTWC-TV in Tallahassee, Florida. Case brought by Flanagan subsequently dismissed. March 2012 Hired as a reporter at WDBJ-TV 30 July 2012 Told to improve behaviour or face the sack after complaints from other staff February 2013 Sacked and escorted from WDBJ May 2014 Sues WDBJ July 2014 Judge dismisses case According to his own LinkedIn account, he worked in several positions in customer service and had a degree in broadcast media from San Francisco State University. He also worked for California's KPIX-TV in the early 1990s. Local media reported Flanagan filed a lawsuit against WDBJ, alleging discrimination by the whole station, naming most of the staff in his complaint. The case was dismissed by a judge in July 2014. Flanagan also sued a Florida TV station in 2000 after he was fired - a case that was dismissed the next year. A local paper said he had also alleged racial discrimination. Don Shafer hired Flanagan at WTWC and said he was a "good on-air performer, a pretty good reporter. "And then things started getting a little strange," said Mr Shafer, now news director at San Diego News 6. He was fired the same year for "odd behaviour." However one woman who worked with him at a TV station in Savannah, Georgia, more than 15 years ago remembered him as a "good guy" who often joked with other staff, NBC reported. Tarcia Bush, then also at WTOC-TV, said Flanagan "was such a mild-mannered guy. "That guy that did this...is not the guy that I knew."
Thousands of activists who took part in anti-government protests which erupted across the Latin American country in February were arrested. The bill will now go to the House of Representatives for approval. The Obama administration opposed sanctions in the past but recently signalled it might support the bill. Deadly protests Relations between the two countries have been frosty since they recalled their ambassadors four years ago. The Venezuela Defense of Human Rights and Civil Society Act targets current and former Venezuelan officials who directed "significant acts of violence or serious human rights abuses against persons associated with the anti-government protests in Venezuela that began on 4 February". More than 40 people from both sides of the political divide were killed in the anti-government protests which took place in Venezuela between February and May. The United Nations condemned "all violence by all sides in Venezuela" and called on the government "to ensure that people are not penalised for exercising their rights to peaceful assembly and to freedom of expression". The government said opposition leaders had incited protesters to violence and had been planning a coup against the government of President Nicolas Maduro. The opposition said its activists had been unfairly targeted for their political convictions. At the height of the protests in February, opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was arrested. He has been charged with inciting violence. And last week, Venezuela's chief prosecutor launched an investigation into leading opposition politician Maria Corina Machado over an alleged plot to assassinate President Maduro. 'Bright spotlight' If the bill is passed, Venezuelan officials deemed to have violated the rights of protesters could be denied visas to the US and see their assets frozen. Senator Robert Menendez, who introduced the bill, said it sent an "unequivocal message to the government of Venezuela". "For too long, Venezuelans have faced state-sponsored violence at the hands of government security forces and watched their country's judiciary become a tool of political repression," the senator said. "We in the United States have an obligation to shine a bright spotlight on Venezuela's abuses and must object to the severe human rights violations committed by the Maduro government and his paramilitary thugs." Previously, the US government opposed sanctions, arguing they would interfere with negotiation efforts between the Venezuelan government and the opposition. But last month, US Deputy National Security Advisor Tony Blinken told a Senate foreign relations committee hearing, "We would not oppose moving forward with additional sanctions." Speaking before the bill was approved, President Maduro said no sanction the US could impose would stop the impetus of Venezuela and its regional allies towards greater independence. He said the threat of sanctions had been "driven by an imperialistic vision of those who think they can rule and conquer us by force through blackmail and their economic power". The bill will now go to the House of Representatives. If it is passed, it will still have to be signed by President Obama.
By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent Public services and safety will be carefully managed though data, while devices in our homes will talk to each other and the wider world as part of the "internet-of-things". Many of these services will be delivered over what is called 5G. It will be much more than just faster data on our phones, but potentially transformational for our lives - if you believe the hype. But there is a darker fear as well. What if it is also transformational for our security if we end up reliant on a Chinese company to deliver this future? That question risks causing a major divide in the Five Eyes - the intelligence alliance between the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The US is campaigning hard among allies to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from delivering 5G. "We have serious concerns over Huawei's obligations to the Chinese government and the danger that poses to the integrity of telecommunications networks in the US and elsewhere," Bill Evanina, head of America's National Counterintelligence and Security Center has said. "Chinese company relationships with the Chinese government aren't like private sector company relationships with governments in the West." 'Rigorous oversight' Huawei has always denied being controlled by the Chinese government, or that its work poses any risks of espionage and sabotage. Its founder repeated these assertions in a recent interview with the BBC. But Australia and New Zealand have sounded negative about Huawei's involvement in their 5G networks to varying degrees, and Canada is still deciding. All eyes are now on the UK. In a speech in Brussels on Wednesday, Ciaran Martin, chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre, set out the framework for considering the security of 5G based on its experience so far of working with the company. The current oversight regime was "arguably the toughest and most rigorous" in the world for Huawei, he said. His officials say they have found ''poor security and engineering" by the company, but the indications are still that the UK may work with Huawei on 5G. If that is the decision then other countries - not only in the Five Eyes but also the EU and Nato - may well be tempted to follow, using the UK as a reference point because of its track record of scrutiny. There could be consequences, former officials warn. "Worries about the security of UK networks following their exposure to Huawei may make the Five Eyes partners, and perhaps others such as France, Germany or Japan, less inclined to co-operate with the UK in the future," Charles Parton, a former British diplomat, argues in a new paper for the think tank Rusi. "The maintenance of a 'Five Eyes standard' of cyber-security in telecommunications is a vital strategic and security interest, the loss of which would go far beyond a reduction in intelligence reports exchanged, and might lead to the UK being excluded from work on developing future technologies for intelligence collection." 'Resilience is key' The UK's special relationship with Huawei came about in the early 2000s, when BT was upgrading its networks and the Chinese firm came in much cheaper than the alternatives - by hundreds of millions of pounds. BT told the government it planned to use the company unless the government was willing to compensate it. Even though Huawei was kept out of the core of the network and sensitive systems, concerns over security and the growing use of Huawei by other companies led - a few years later - to the creation of a "cell" to evaluate the security of Huawei products coming into the UK. The cell's last oversight report downgraded the assurance about mitigating the risks associated with Huawei, because of serious problems with security and engineering processes. However, Mr Martin said in his speech, the report said that these were not indicators of hostile activity by China, . The company says it will invest money to deal with these concerns in the coming years, although UK officials say that so far they have not seen "a credible plan". Despite that, the indications are that the UK wants to hold out against US pressure and continue to work with the company on 5G. A decision is expected in the next two months by ministers who will need to balance security with costs and the risks to wider relationships. "Resilience is key," Mr Martin said in Brussels. "There must be sustainable diversity in the supplier market." That was one signal that even though the UK may work with Huawei, it is cautious about ending up with one dominant player on whom it is dependent. But critics fear that Huawei - possibly with Chinese state backing - is working its way into a dominant position in the long term, particularly by penetrating markets in the developing world and by setting standards for 5G. One of the biggest challenges with 5G is cost. Significant cost In many countries, telecoms companies paid much more for the 5G spectrum than they had expected. They are now looking at the sums and indicating their strong preference for the cheapest vendor - Huawei. Telecoms operators in the UK say the way in which 5G can work in a highly integrated system alongside 4G means that excluding Huawei is not realistic without significant cost and delay, including potentially removing existing hardware, leading to the UK falling behind. Breaking the ties with the company could also have significant consequences for the UK-China relationship which poses challenges with Brexit approaching. But the question will be how the US and the Trump administration reacts if the UK does not follow its line - especially if other countries use the UK as cover to follow and work with Huawei. This at a time when the UK may be looking for a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. It potentially leaves the UK between a rock and a hard place and is one more reason why the Huawei decision is placing strain on the historically close Five Eyes intelligence relationship.
By Vibeke VenemaBBC Stories For teenagers on the verge of independence, losing their freedom can be hard. Ligia and her family have been self-isolating since 18 March, because her mother is heavily pregnant. As someone who was always out, seeing friends and working, she has found it challenging to be stuck in a flat with four people. "Since going into isolation my anxiety has really increased," Ligia says. "It often comes really unexpectedly. I have trouble breathing and thinking straight. It's just a sense of all-over-the-place-ness." The biggest blow was the government's cancellation of the A-levels she had been revising for. "It was really tough to hear. I cried. It had a big impact on me," she says. "It was like I had been preparing to run the marathon and I was at the start line and they were counting down, 3, 2, 1 - and then they tell you they're not going to run the race." School has been part of Ligia's life for as long as she can remember, so being unable to "close that chapter properly" is very hard, she says. "I can't distract myself by going out. I spend my days doing revision." It's hard to be motivated when this revision may never be tested, but Ligia has found ways of improving her mental health. "I make my bed in the morning so I won't get back into it. I try to regulate my breathing and listen to a lot of deep relaxation music," she says. "Meanwhile I'm keeping busy by learning about witchcraft online - teaching myself something gives me that feeling of: 'Yes, I can do this alone.'" Naomi, 21, a final-year psychology student from Cardiff, says her anxiety has increased hugely due to the coronavirus. Her finals were cancelled, and although the lectures and exams have moved online, the loss of routine and uncertainty around grading have affected her. The things she used to do to manage her anxiety, such as volunteering, and following a strict routine that got her out of the house, are no longer an option. So she has had to develop new coping strategies. Naomi finds that keeping a journal helps, using prompts like: What's making me feel this way? What am I grateful for today? "Those questions point me to think about what I have done during the day and what's been positive, and also write about the things that I'm worrying about," she says. Another positive is the strong sense of community that the coronavirus crisis has created. "We're all in this together and it is quite nice to know that there's people out there who understand those worries," she says. At the same time, she's concerned that people like her, with longstanding mental health problems, might be forgotten. A survey by YoungMinds has shown that the coronavirus pandemic is having a profound effect on young people with existing mental health conditions. Although they understood the need for the measures taken in response to the virus, the report says, this did not lessen the impact. Many of those who took part in the survey reported increased anxiety, problems with sleep, panic attacks or more frequent urges to self-harm. Professionals who work in the young people's mental health sector are continuing to provide support where they can, the charity reports. "They are going to remarkable lengths to reach young people, even though face-to-face contact is now usually restricted and remote support is often challenging," says Emma Thomas, Chief Executive of YoungMinds. "While we recognise the huge efforts being made, we need to find ways to help those young people who have lost their support - not least because, in many cases, they have also lost many of their coping mechanisms, including contact with friends or routines that help them to manage their conditions. We also know that many young people who previously might not have needed mental health support are likely to do so in future." Another organisation that has noticed changes as a result of coronavirus is Shout, a free 24-hour texting service for people in crisis. Over the past week, they have experienced a steady increase in the number of people contacting them, peaking at more than 1,000 conversations on Sunday. Around 70% of their texters are under the age of 25 and in that age group they have seen a growing number of conversations about coronavirus, currently around 25% of all conversations daily. Alongside that, they are seeing an increase in conversations about anxiety, while conversations about coronavirus are almost twice as likely to involve anxiety (60%) as usual. "It is just anxiety, anxiety, anxiety," says Amy, one of Shout's Crisis Volunteers. "The overall theme has just been the lack of control." Amy says people in crisis can find it hard to even pick up the phone, so texting can be easier. In her conversations, she aims to de-escalate the crisis and decide on next steps. Many texters are struggling with the loss of routine, so she has been helping them find new ones. "Without a routine, I know that a lot of bad habits and bad thoughts can come in," says Amy, who has experienced mental health problems herself. One texter was distraught because since the West End shut down they could no longer meet up with friends to see a show. The plan they came up with was to make a scrapbook with all their tickets and write down their memories. Since the shutdown, John 18, from North London, has found it harder to distract himself from his depression. His family have been self-isolating since 15 March, after his mother, who works in a school, fell ill with suspected Covid-19. Being forced to stay indoors has had a negative impact on John's mental health. "Normally, if I was feeling really bad, I would go on a bus ride and be able to just clear my thoughts for a bit," he says. "I would pick a bus number and take the route fully. But I can't really do that now. I'm stuck in my mental cycles and I've been feeling especially low. I'm not able to come out of it as easily." John missed a term-and-a-half of school due to a serious depressive episode, and had already decided to repeat Year 13. The closure of his school has actually helped him because all their educational resources are now available online - and he prefers this method of learning to the classroom. However, he has not yet been able to meet his new adult counsellor because of the lockdown, and that worries him. "I don't want to feel worse," he says. Even though he's "pretty nocturnal" he tries to get out of his bedroom as much as possible so he can sleep better. "If you're constantly thinking and being busy in your bedroom, when you eventually want to go to sleep, you're going to be stuck with those thoughts. Try and go into the living room or garden if you can. I feel that helps me." Thirteen-year-old Chloe was up until midnight tidying her bedroom earlier this week, just to keep busy. "Once she starts something she gets quite obsessive about it," says her mother, Julie Cambridge. The family have taken great care to self-isolate because Julie is a carer for her adult daughter and grandchildren, who live a few doors away on their Brixton estate and she cannot risk getting ill. Chloe, her youngest daughter, has ADHD and anxiety, and since the schools closed she has been "climbing the walls", says Julie. She's very sporty and sociable and would usually be out running or mixing with friends. "Now I feel bored and lazy," says Chloe. "I want to go outside because I feel claustrophobic." She listens to music, stays in touch with friends on social media and does her school work via Google classroom. But her anxiety has got worse, and she's been moody. "I can get aggravated easily, and I'll probably give you attitude," she says. By contrast, Julie's 16-year-old daughter, Jade, has never been one for going out. "Since primary school, she's just come home and done homework every day," Julie says. But Jade was "knocked for six" when her GCSEs were cancelled. "I was gutted, honestly, I was very stressed," says Jade. "I've put a lot of effort into these exams, prepared myself really well. Now we're not even getting the opportunity." She's still studying but admits that she's lost a lot of motivation, and that it has affected her mental health. "I'm quite stressed about everything. It's affecting my mood, definitely. I'll become very down and distant from everyone." Jade wants to go to university to do biomedical science. Her predicted grades are good, but she was looking forward to doing even better; studies have shown that university applicants from low-income backgrounds are significantly more likely to have their grades under-predicted than those from high-income backgrounds. "Everybody has low expectations of the children from this area. It isn't the norm for someone to achieve and make something of themselves," says Julie, who wonders how all this will affect Jade in future. "I'm worried they will be known as the 'Covid generation', the ones who didn't do their exams - will people look at them differently because they didn't sit down and do that test? "It's the sense of achievement that they're missing out on." Exams and graduations are rituals and milestones that are important in a young person's development, says Hanspeter Dorner, a Consultant Child & Adolescent Psychiatrist in East London. "Missing out on these milestones can have an adverse impact, but perhaps you can recreate these rituals at a later date." Naomi and her fellow university students are doing exactly that - they are still planning on holding the Psychology Ball at a future date. "We can schedule it at the same time of our actual graduation so that we still get to have those celebrations," she says. "They're a way of marking the closure of something, and it's really important that we still get the opportunity to do that." Top tips for looking after your mental wellbeing while at home Be safe and stay connected - Self-isolation doesn't mean cutting off all communication, in fact, it's more important than ever to talk and listen, share stories and advice, and stay in touch with the people who matter to you. Take notice of things that make you feel good - Eating healthy food, keeping moving by going out for walks or exercising can help us to feel good. Notice the beauty outside your window or on a walk around the block, taking time to acknowledge people you see. Go on an information mini-break - the endless updates from news outlets and people on social media can be completely overwhelming. Pick one trusted source of information and visit it once a day only. Share how you're feeling - Talk to loved ones and friends. Talking has the effect of lifting our mood and really helps us to begin to feel more positive if we're having a tough time. Keep moving - Find ways to move your body and your mood every day. It's OK to go for a walk, run or ride your bike, as long as you avoid other people. Stick to a routine - This sounds dull but it will help you get through each day. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time, eat regularly, shower, change your clothes, get some fresh air, book in video-chats with colleagues or friends, do your chores. Make time for fun! Find ways to relax and distract - Finding things that help you breathe deeply, consciously setting your worries aside or focusing on the moment to recharge can be helpful. Distracting yourself by watching films or TV programmes, reading or listening to music will help you to set things in context and provide relief from anxious feelings.

"The decision has been made. Things will be left as is," said Abdallah Salem el-Badri, secretary general of the oil producers' cartel, speaking in Dubai. On Friday Brent crude dropped below $62 a barrel, its lowest price since 2009. "The fundamentals should not lead to this dramatic reduction [in price]," Mr el-Badri added. Mr el-Badri said Opec was "assessing the situation to determine what the real reasons behind the decrease in oil prices are". The comments are Mr el-Badri's first since Opec's meeting in Vienna last month, where it decided to leave production levels unchanged. Mr el-Badri said its decision was not aimed at undermining other oil producers. "Some people say this decision was directed at the United States and shale oil. All of this is incorrect. Some also say it was directed at Iran. And Russia. This also is incorrect," he said. The price of Brent crude has dropped almost 50% since June on sluggish global demand and rising production from the US. On Friday, it settled at $61.46 a barrel after the world energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, forecast even lower prices on weaker demand and larger supplies next year.
The first film of the series will be titled Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Warner Bros said the film series was part of an "expanded creative partnership" with the best-selling author. The eight Harry Potter films are the largest-grossing film franchise in history. The new film will feature Newt Scamander, the fictional author of the textbook Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, owned by Harry Potter at Hogwarts school. Warner Bros has given no indication as to when the film could go into production. "It all started when Warner Bros came to me with the suggestion of turning Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them into a film," said Rowling. "I thought it was a fun idea, but the idea of seeing Newt Scamander, the supposed author of Fantastic Beasts, realised by another writer was difficult. "Having lived for so long in my fictional universe, I feel very protective of it and I already knew a lot about Newt. As hard-core Harry Potter fans will know, I liked him so much that I even married his grandson, Rolf, to one of my favourite characters from the Harry Potter series, Luna Lovegood. She went on: "As I considered Warners' proposal, an idea took shape that I couldn't dislodge. That is how I ended up pitching my own idea for a film to Warner Bros. "Although it will be set in the worldwide community of witches and wizards where I was so happy for 17 years, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is neither a prequel nor a sequel to the Harry Potter series, but an extension of the wizarding world. "The laws and customs of the hidden magical society will be familiar to anyone who has read the Harry Potter books or seen the films, but Newt's story will start in New York, 70 years before Harry's gets underway." Rowling added: "I always said that I would only revisit the wizarding world if I had an idea that I was really excited about and this is it." Blockbuster franchise Warner Bros also announced that it would serve as the worldwide TV distributor (excluding the UK) for the upcoming BBC TV adaptation of Rowling's recent adult novel The Casual Vacancy. It is expected to air in 2014. More than 450 million copies of Rowling's seven Potter books have been sold worldwide. She also wrote two small volumes, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages - both named after Harry's schoolbooks within the novels. They were published in March 2001 in aid of Comic Relief. Another Potter spin-off book, The Tales of Beedle the Bard, followed in December 2008. The Harry Potter novels, about a boy wizard who survives the attack that kills his parents, became a worldwide phenomenon and were turned into eight blockbuster Warner Bros films starring Daniel Radcliffe. The films have grossed more than $7.7bn (£4.8bn) to date worldwide at the box office, making Harry Potter the largest-grossing film franchise in history.
By Reality Check teamBBC News The winning left-wing candidate will now earn a salary equivalent to about $5,707 (£4,310) a month and no other public official will be able to earn more than him. Mr López Obrador said the official residence, Los Pinos, will become a cultural centre. The Mexican politician is certainly not the first leader to make the statement of lowering his or her salary. It's a populist gesture often used to demonstrate that a leader of a country is in touch with the people, putting distance between themselves and the elite, says Dr Philipp Koeker at the Leibniz University, Hannover, who has studied presidential salaries in Europe. Reality Check has looked at some of the countries where this has happened before. Allowances and expenses mean there can be differences between the official salary and what the prime minister or president actually earns so it's not always easy to know the total income. But there are still significant gaps in the basic salaries of leaders around the world. The Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is said to be the highest earner - paid more than $2m (£1.5m) a year. That amount is tied to the highest salaries in the country's private sector. British Prime Minister Theresa May earns about £150,000 a year, less than German Chancellor Angela Merkel who earns closer to £200,000 whereas Chinese President Xi Jinping is said to earn just $22,000 (£16,600) a year. Who else has taken a pay cut? Uruguay's Jose Mujica in power until 2015, labelled the world's poorest president, gave away 90% of his monthly salary, which was about £7,500. Although many leaders have forgone part of their earnings, they've still enjoyed the exclusive perks of the job. However, Mr Mujica drove an old Volkswagen Beetle and chose to live in a farmhouse instead of the presidential residence. Also in the region, Evo Morales the president of Bolivia, reduced his salary to about £1,000 a month when he took power in 2005. He was fulfilling an election campaign promise. In Bolivia, no public sector employee is allowed to earn more than the president, which meant at the time there were pay reviews across the government. In 2015, the then president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, under fire for the country's widespread economic challenges, ordered mass cuts to government jobs and a 10% reduction to her own salary to about $90,000 (£68,000) a year. A 10% cut to the salaries of Russian President Vladimir Putin and his staff was announced in 2015 amid rising food prices and Western sanctions. Mr Putin declared an income of 18.73m roubles (£226,444) in 2017. More than half of this amount came from the sale of a property in the Moscow area. South Africa's new president Cyril Ramaphosa said he intends to cut his salary in half, which means about £100,000 will be distributed through the Nelson Mandela Foundation. A former businessman and one of South Africa's richest men Mr Ramaphosa reportedly has a fortune of more than $400m. The presidential salary in Nigeria was $70,000 (£53,000) before Muhammadu Buhari and his vice president agreed to a 50% pay cut at the beginning of his term in 2015. Going back further, in the 1980s the former president of Burkina Faso Thomas Sankara took a monthly wage of $450 and banned the use of chauffeur-driven cars and first class airline tickets by his ministers, according to the Guardian. Who doesn't take a salary? The current Slovakian president, Andrej Kiska, who entered politics a rich man, donates his entire salary to a charity. In 2013, the Slovakian president had received a monthly salary of more than $9,000 (£6,800). It was the highest in central and eastern Europe at the time, according to an analysis by Dr Koeker. Donald Trump has followed in the footsteps of other US presidents by donating most of his salary to charity and only taking $1 a year. Herbert Hoover and John F Kennedy made the same symbolic gesture. American presidents earn about $400,000 (£320,000) a year. Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer told journalists at a news conference in March 2017 that Mr Trump wanted the help of the media to decide where the salary should be donated.

About 10,000 dogs will be slaughtered for their meat at the Lychee and Dog Meat Festival in Yulin in Guangxi province on Sunday and Monday to mark the summer solstice, state media said. One retired school teacher from Tianjin hit the headlines when she purchased dozens of dogs to save them. Residents and vendors in Yulin say the animals are killed in a humane way. Activists say the killing is cruel and an online campaign to ban the festival has been signed by more than 3.8 million people so far and the campaign has attracted considerable support this year from celebrities both domestic and foreign. Celebrities including British comedian Ricky Gervais have spoken out on Twitter with the hashtag #StopYuLin2015. Chinese pop star Chen Kun and actor Yang Mi have said they are joining the campaign on micro blogging site Weibo. Why UK doesn't eat dog meat And Chinese actor Fan Bingbing and others posted a video online against the festival. The tradition of eating dog meat dates back four or five hundred years in China, South Korea and other countries, as it is believed to ward off the heat of the summer months, according to state news agency Xinhua. However, this festival began in recent years, Xinhua said. City officials have distanced themselves from the gathering. "Some residents of Yulin have the habit of coming together to eat lychees and dog meat during the summer solstice," the city's news office wrote on Weibo. "The 'summer solstice lychee and dog meat festival' is a commercial term, the city has never [officially] organised a 'dog meat festival'," it added. As in recent years, some animal lovers resorted to buying some of the dogs in order to rescue them. Yang Xiaoyun, retired school teacher, paid about 7,000 yuan ($1,100; £710) to save 100 dogs on Saturday. The BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing says this kind of dispute puts the government in a really difficult position. The glorified consumption of dog meat generates a lot of negative foreign media reports, embarrassing the authorities. Also, the dog meat industry has been accused of many underhand tactics, including the illegal capture of family pets to use as food. But at the same time, the government is wary of the increasingly sophisticated animal rights movement, she adds. Animal rights activists in China have formed a cohesive network on social media that extends to many foreign animal welfare groups. China's leaders do not want to encourage such a movement amid a wider crackdown on civil disturbance of any kind.
By Robin BrantBBC News, Shanghai "A couple of years ago one of my IT managers copied ten thousand pages of my entire company's profile," Frank Liu told me. His company Intco has been around for 25 years. He told me the stolen download included "our technology information, our customer list, our purchasing and supply information. Everything." Intco is a business that makes medical devices, skirting boards and photo frames. I visited its offices at a business park in Shanghai, and a factory that sits either side of a tree-lined road south of the city. The company recycles polystyrene waste sent to China from all over the world. Then, using heat moulding and imprinting techniques, it turns it into an array of products which end up on the floors of houses in Brazil or Russia, or hanging on walls displaying photos in the US and Britain. "We actually have the record of how he stole it," Mr Liu told me. "He just sold it to establish another company, as his investment." Mr Liu feels he has no recourse. He told me he went to the police but nothing happened. He said he still intends to pursue it. His story is increasingly common here, for both local businesses and foreign firms. Top officials from the US and China will hold their next round of trade talks this week and protecting intellectual property (IP) is a key demand for Washington. They argue American and other foreign companies in China have endured decades of theft and infringement. Reacting to pressure China has taken some steps to address the problem. The country only established copyright laws in the 1980s, but things have progressed relatively quickly since then. China now has specialist IP courts, albeit - like every aspect of the judicial system - subservient to the ruling Communist Party. They are supposed to settle cases within 12 to 18 months. Their creation was not due solely to outside pressure from foreign firms. Chinese business figures like Mr Liu have also called for the country's legal system to better protect the innovators and entrepreneurs who have turned China into much more than the "copycat" economy it was once labelled. Benjamin Qiu, an IP lawyer with US law firm Loeb & Loeb, told me that the Chinese are now just as litigious as foreign firms. Foreign firms are just as likely to win a case - a good case, Mr Qiu added - as domestic plaintiffs. In the past few years Lego and New Balance have both won high-profile cases against copycat manufacturers. There is no doubt that the trade war with the US has sped up the pace of reform in China. President Xi Jinping recently led lawmakers, at their annual gathering in Beijing, in approving new rules for foreign investors. The Foreign Investment Law states that the transfer of technology from foreign investors to any domestic partner must be voluntary. China has always defended this highly contentious practice by insisting it's part of an agreed commercial arrangement. The new law also bars government officials from passing on details of foreign investors IP. A new era? Now though comes the hard part - enforcement. Mr Qiu told me the next step is "detailed regulation coming out after this law, and we want to see actual cases in local courts and also from enforcement agencies." If that follows, then he thinks "potentially the foreign IP owners will have more to protect [them] in China." Both the EU and American Chambers of Commerce welcomed the new law, but both also criticised what they said was ambiguity in the legislation. The Americans also had concerns that it was rushed through without proper consultation. Many foreign companies have been stung over the years in China. Most have found the lure of the massive market, or what was once rock bottom labour costs, irresistible. Some though feel the risk is too high. A fruit industry executive recently told me his firm wanted to buy new conveyor belts for their farms in China, but the European manufacturers said no. They feared their systems would be copied here, and they'd be wiped out. Mr Liu can't do that. He is Chinese and wants to stay in China. But he has taken steps to try to prevent another IP theft. He is chief executive of the company he founded, but this year he told me he's changing his title to include head of research and development. Because he can't trust anyone else with the firms' commercial secrets. Protecting original ideas, techniques and information in China - "it's a human right" he told me.
But the issue of Scottish MPs voting on law that does not affect them will get "more pressing" if there is further devolution, Mr Cameron told the BBC. All the main Westminster parties have promised to devolve more power if Scotland votes against independence. The Yes campaign says only a vote for independence can guarantee more powers. More say Asked whether there should be an English parliament, Mr Cameron told the BBC's Newsnight programme: "I don't think we're remotely at that stage. On the status of Scottish MPs, he said: "Clearly this question will get more pressing with further devolution but nothing that would happen would change the fact that the people of Scotland are being offered a chance through their own parliament to set their own rules on tax and spending and welfare." The promise of a further transfer of powers to Scotland if it stays in the Union has prompted cross-party calls for the regions of England to get more say over tax and spending as well. Conservative MP John Redwood has said Scotland's MPs should not vote on matters relating solely to England, and that English MPs should meet to decide English-only issues. 'Prior question' BBC political correspondent Ben Wright says there are huge constitutional questions about the governance of the whole UK that flow from Scotland's decision. Mr Cameron also defended the decision to put just one question to Scotland's voters in Thursday's referendum, and not to include an explicit option of more devolution on the ballot paper. "I think it was right to have one question, because if Scotland wants more devolution, and I think Scotland should have more devolution, you have to answer the prior question: 'Do you want to stay in the United Kingdom?'," he said. "That wasn't just my view, that was the view of the leaders of other United Kingdom parties who all thought it was important; let's settle the question of separation and then look at devolution. "In this campaign the individual parties have set out their proposals, they've been quite strikingly similar, so it's been possible to make progress."
He said he did not want his illness to get in the way of decision making, and apologised to the Japanese people for failing to complete his term in office. The 65-year-old has suffered for many years from ulcerative colitis, an inflammatory bowel disease, but he said his condition had worsened recently. Last year, he became Japan's longest serving prime minister. His current period in office began in 2012. He will remain in his post until a successor is chosen. In 2007 he resigned abruptly from an earlier term as prime minister because of his struggles with ulcerative colitis, a chronic condition that he has lived with since he was a teenager. Mr Abe has a reputation as a staunch conservative and nationalist, and for stimulating growth with his aggressive economic policy known as "Abenomics". He has strengthened Japan's defences and boosted military spending, but has been unable to revise the constitution's pacifist Article 9, which bans a standing army for anything other than self-defence. What did Mr Abe say? The prime minister said his health started to decline as his ulcerative colitis made a resurgence around the middle of July. He was now receiving a new treatment for the condition which had to be administered on a regular basis and would not give him enough time to carry out his prime ministerial functions, he added. He said he could not make any mistakes in terms of important decision making, and therefore had decided to step down. "I made a judgement I should not continue my job as a prime minister," he said. "I would like to sincerely apologise to the people of Japan for leaving my post with one year left in my term of office, and amid the coronavirus woes, while various policies are still in the process of being implemented," he added, making a bow. He also expressed regret at not fulfilling his core pledges - forcing North Korea to return Japanese citizens abducted decades ago; sorting out a territorial dispute with Russia; and overhauling the constitution to give more power to the military. Abe's emotional farewell By Mariko Oi, BBC News, Tokyo Announcing his resignation at a news conference, Mr Abe spoke without the use of a teleprompter, which is unusual for him. Rather than addressing prepared questions, the prime minister mostly took questions. He seemed drained and was at times emotional as he faced the reporters. Asked about his attempts to control his public image - for instance by pre-selecting questions for news briefings - he avoided answering by saying that his administration wasn't the first to do so. He was also repeatedly asked who he thought should replace him, or when, to which he said it wasn't his place to weigh in. But the Liberal Democratic Party which has almost continuously been in power since 1955 has many different factions so the race is on between them to get the top job. Those close to Mr Abe, like Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga or Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Taro Aso, are not necessarily the most popular among voters as his administration has faced criticism for its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. What happens now? Mr Abe said he would "firmly execute my duty to the end" until a replacement was chosen. His announcement will have automatically triggered a vote within his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to replace him as leader. The party will decide next Tuesday how to hold an election, Kyodo news agency reports. This election will be followed by a parliamentary vote to elect a new prime minister. Potential successors have already emerged, including Deputy Prime Minister Taro Aso, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, and LDP policy chief Fumio Kishida, who is rumoured to be Mr Abe's choice. None are expected to deviate significantly from the government's current policies. The winner would hold the post until the end of Mr Abe's term in September 2021.
The judge in charge of the case rejected the request by prosecutors to drop the charges against the striker. Messi and his father Jorge are accused of defrauding Spain of more than €4m (£3.1m; $5m). They deny any wrongdoing. Lawyers acting on behalf of the tax authorities demanded 22-month jail sentences for both defendants. Prosecutors allege that Jorge avoided paying tax on his son's earnings by using offshore companies in Belize and Uruguay in 2007-09. Messi's lawyers had argued that the player had "never devoted a minute of his life to reading, studying or analysing" the contracts, El Pais newspaper reported earlier. 'Corrective payment' "There are rational signs that the criminality was committed by both accused parties," wrote the judge in a court filing, according to the AFP news agency. No date has been set for the trial of the 28-year-old footballer - the four-time World Player of the Year and one of the richest athletes in the world. In June, the high court in Barcelona ruled that Messi should not be granted immunity for not knowing what was happening with his finances, which were being managed in part by his father. The income related to Messi's image rights, including contracts with Banco Sabadell, Danone, Adidas, Pepsi-Cola, Procter and Gamble, and the Kuwait Food Company. Messi and his father made a voluntary €5m "corrective payment" - equal to the alleged unpaid tax plus interest - in August 2013.
Canadian-Egyptian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohamed were led away from court after the verdict. Australian Peter Greste was deported back to Australia earlier this year and was on trial again in absentia. The three are accused of aiding the banned Muslim Brotherhood group but they strenuously deny the allegations. The three journalists were originally sentenced in July 2014, with Mr Greste and Mr Fahmy receiving seven years and Mr Mohamed getting 10 years. But their convictions were overturned in January this year and they were freed in February to await retrial. Giving the verdict on Saturday, judge Hassan Farid said the three men were not registered journalists and had been operating from a Cairo hotel without a licence. He handed three-year sentences to Mr Greste and Mr Fahmy but gave Mr Mohamed an additional six months. Reaction: Peter Greste speaks to the BBC It is unclear how long Mr Fahmy and Mr Mohamed will now serve. They were in prison for about a year before being freed. Lawyers for the three journalists are expected to appeal against the decision. The BBC's Lyse Doucet, who was in the court, said the verdict came as a shock to a room packed full of Egyptian and foreign journalists. The expectation was that the journalists would be found guilty, she adds, but that they would be given a lesser sentence and be allowed to walk free. 'Dangerous message' Mr Greste said in a tweet that he was "shocked" and "outraged" while Al-Jazeera said the verdict was "yet another deliberate attack on press freedom". Outside the courtroom, Mr Fahmy's lawyer, Amal Clooney, called on Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi to issue a pardon to the journalists. "The verdict today sends a very dangerous message in Egypt," she told reporters. "It sends a message that journalists can be locked up for simply doing their job, for telling the truth and reporting the news." She said she would push for her client, who has given up his Egyptian citizenship, to be deported to Canada.
In a tiny number of children it can cause serious complications, with some needing intensive care. Up to 100 children in the UK have been affected and studies suggest the same reaction is being seen in children elsewhere in Europe. It is likely to be caused by a delayed immune response to the virus which looks like Kawasaki disease. In April, NHS doctors were told to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children. This was prompted by eight children becoming ill in London, including a 14-year-old who died. They all had similar symptoms when they were admitted to Evelina London Children's Hospital, including a high fever, rash, red eyes, swelling and general pain. Most of the children had no major lung or breathing problems, although seven were put on a ventilator to help improve heart and circulation issues. Doctors are describing it as a "new phenomenon" similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome - a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Symptoms include a rash, swollen glands in the neck and dry and cracked lips. But this new syndrome is also affecting older children up to the age of 16, with a minority experiencing serious complications. Dr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology, at Imperial College London, said the fact that the syndrome was occurring in the middle of a pandemic, suggests the two are linked. "You've got the Covid-19 peak, and then three or four weeks later we're seeing a peak in this new phenomenon which makes us think that it's a post-infectious phenomenon," she said. This means it is likely to be something related to the build up of antibodies after infection. 'Exceptionally rare' Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the majority of children who have had the condition have responded to treatment and are getting better and starting to go home. The syndrome is "exceptionally rare", he said. "This shouldn't stop parents letting their children exit lockdown," Prof Viner added. He said understanding more about the inflammatory disease "might explain why some children become very ill with Covid-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic". Children are thought to make up just 1-2% of all cases of coronavirus infection, accounting for less than 500 admissions to hospital. Michael Levin, professor of paediatrics and international child health at Imperial, explained that most of the children tested negative for coronavirus, but tested positive for detection of antibodies. "So we really think that the biology of the disease, somehow involves an unusual immune response to the virus," he said. However Prof Levin said there was "a vast amount to learn" about the reaction, which had only been known about for two to three weeks. Children appear to be affected up to six weeks after they have been infected with the virus, which could explain the appearance of the new syndrome several weeks after the peak of UK cases. What is the situation elsewhere in the world? There have been similar cases in the US, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands. At least 15 US states are looking into the rare condition, according to New York governor Andrew Cuomo. Out of 82 diagnosed cases of the inflammatory syndrome in New York, 53 children tested positive or had antibodies for Covid-19. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US is set to issue an alert and updated definition of the syndrome to healthcare providers this week. Meanwhile, according to a study by doctors in northern Italy, 10 children have been affected by the disease. All 10 of the children in the study were admitted to a hospital in Bergamo - the city at the centre of the worst outbreak in Italy - between mid-February and mid-April, and recovered. The children, who had an average age of seven, tended to have severe symptoms such as heart complications and signs of toxic shock syndrome. They also needed additional treatment with steroids. In antibody tests on the children, eight appeared to have already had the coronavirus while the other two had not. But the researchers said the tests were not 100% accurate. Swab tests to detect the virus are not thought to be useful because the reaction tends to occur many weeks after infection. Dr Lucio Verdoni, report author and doctor at the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, said: "Although this complication remains very rare, our study provides further evidence on how the virus may be affecting children." Child health experts in the UK say it may not be something which just affects children. They are now working with researchers in the US and across Europe to find out more about what they have called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome or (PIMS-TS).
In an interview with the Times, Shamima Begum, now 19, talked about seeing "beheaded heads" in bins - but said that it "did not faze her". Speaking from a refugee camp in Syria, she said she was nine months pregnant and wanted to come home for her baby. She said she'd had two other children who had both died. She also described how one of her two school friends that had left the UK with her had died in a bombing. The fate of the third girl is unclear. 'It was like a normal life' Bethnal Green Academy pupils Ms Begum and Amira Abase were both 15, while Kadiza Sultana was 16, when they left the UK in February 2015. They flew from Gatwick Airport to Turkey after telling their parents they were going out for the day. They later crossed the border into Syria. After arriving in Raqqa, she stayed at a house with other newly arrived brides-to-be, she told the Times. "I applied to marry an English-speaking fighter between 20 and 25 years old," she said. Ten days later she married a 27-year-old Dutch man who had converted to Islam. She has been with him since then, and the couple escaped from Baghuz - the group's last territory in eastern Syria - two weeks ago. Her husband surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters as they left, and she is now one of 39,000 people in a refugee camp in northern Syria. Asked by Times journalist Anthony Loyd whether her experiences of living in the one-time IS stronghold of Raqqa had lived up to her aspirations, Ms Begum said: "Yes, it did. It was like a normal life. The life that they show on the propaganda videos - it's a normal life. "Every now and then there are bombs and stuff. But other than that..." She said that seeing her first "severed head" in a bin "didn't faze me at all". "It was from a captured fighter seized on the battlefield, an enemy of Islam. "I thought only of what he would have done to a Muslim woman if he had the chance," she said. "I'm not the same silly little 15-year-old schoolgirl who ran away from Bethnal Green four years ago," she told Mr Loyd. "I don't regret coming here." Will Shamima Begum be allowed to return to UK? Shamima Begum was legally a child when she pinned her colours to the Islamic State mast. And if she were still under 18 years old, the government would have a duty to take her and her unborn child's "best interests" into account in deciding what to do next. But she's now an apparently unrepentant adult - and that means she would have to account for her decisions, even if her journey is a story of grooming and abuse. Another British jihadi bride, Tareena Shakil, who got out of the war zone with her child, lied to the security services on her return and was jailed for membership of a terrorist group. If Ms Begum got out of the country, that is the kind of charge she could face - along with encouraging or supporting terrorism. But that's a long way off. Assuming she made it to an airport, the UK could temporarily ban her from returning until she agreed to be investigated, monitored and deradicalised. Social services would also certainly step in to consider whether her child should be removed to protect him or her from radicalisation. But Ms Begum said the "oppression" had come as a "shock" and said she felt the IS "caliphate" was at an end. "I don't have high hopes. They are just getting smaller and smaller," she said. "And there is so much oppression and corruption going on that I don't really think they deserve victory." She referred to her husband having been held in a prison where men were tortured. A lawyer for the family of Kadiza Sultana said in 2016 that she was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike. Ms Begum told the Times her friend had died in a bombing on a house where there was "some secret stuff going on" underground. She added: "I never thought it would happen. At first I was in denial. Because I always thought if we got killed, we'd get killed together." 'Scared this baby is going to get sick' Ms Begum said losing two children "came as a shock. It just came out of nowhere, it was so hard". Her first child, a girl, died at the age of one year and nine months, and was buried in Baghuz a month ago. Her second child - the first to die - died three months ago at the age of eight months, of an illness that was compounded by malnutrition, the Times reports. She told the paper she took him to a hospital. "There were no drugs available, and not enough medical staff," she said. As a result she said she was "really overprotective" of her unborn child. She said this concern also contributed to her decision to leave Baghuz. "I was weak," she said. "I could not endure the suffering and hardship that staying on the battlefield involved. "But I was also frightened that the child I am about to give birth to would die like my other children if I stayed on." She said she remained scared her unborn baby would become ill in the refugee camp. "That's why I really want to get back to Britain because I know it will be taken care of - health-wise, at least," she said. She said she should be giving birth "any day now". "I'll do anything required just to be able to come home and live quietly with my child." Tasnime Akunjee, a lawyer who was instructed by the Bethnal Green girls' families after they ran away, said the families had told him they now wanted "time and space to process what's happened". Security minister Ben Wallace said he could not comment on Ms Begum's case for legal reasons but said any Britons who had gone to Syria to engage or support terrorist activities should be prepared to be questioned, investigated and potentially prosecuted if they came back to the UK. He said there was no consular assistance in Syria so any Briton wanting help would need to find consular services elsewhere in the region. Asked whether the government would be rushing to bring home people such as Ms Begum, he said: "I'm not putting at risk British people's lives to go and look for terrorists or former terrorists in a failed state." He added that while the UK had a duty of care to children of Britons in Syria, he also had a duty towards all UK citizens and would do what was "proportionate and necessary" to keep people safe. Sir Peter Fahy, a retired senior police chief who led the Prevent terrorism prevention programme at the time the girls ran away, said he could understand why the government was "not particularly interested" in facilitating her return. "If the woman was showing complete remorse, it would be completely different," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. It would cost a "vast amount of money" and the biggest challenge would be for local police to keep her safe and ensure she did not become a lightning rod for both right-wing extremists and Islamic extremists, he added. Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent, said it should be remembered that Ms Begum was groomed as a child to become a radicalised woman and was a "victim of brainwashing". IS has lost control of most of the territory it overran, including its strongholds of Mosul, in Iraq, and Raqqa, in Syria. However, fighting continues in north-eastern Syria, where the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) say they captured dozens of foreign fighters in recent weeks.
By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Asked to model a "reasonable" worst-case scenario, they suggest a range between 24,500 and 251,000 of virus-related deaths in hospitals alone, peaking in January and February. To date, there have been 44,830 official deaths in the UK, but this has slowed with 1,100 in July. The estimate does not take into account any lockdowns, treatments or vaccines. And the scientists say: "The risk... could be reduced if we take action immediately". The report, requested by the UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, stresses there is still a high degree of uncertainty over how the coronavirus pandemic will play out this winter. But research suggests the virus can survive longer in colder conditions and is more likely to spread when people spend more time indoors. And experts are concerned the NHS will be under extreme pressure, not just from a resurgence of coronavirus but also from seasonal flu and a backlog of regular, non-coronavirus workload. The health service is already severely disrupted in the aftermath of the first pandemic wave, with a waiting list that could stand at 10 million by the end of this year, the report says. Prof Stephen Holgate, a respiratory specialist from University Hospital Southampton NHS Trust, who chaired the report, said: "This is not a prediction - but it is a possibility. "The modelling suggests that deaths could be higher with a new wave of Covid-19 this winter. "But the risk of this happening could be reduced if we take action immediately." With relatively low numbers of coronavirus cases at the moment, "this is a critical window of opportunity to help us prepare for the worst that winter can throw at us", he added. Less pessimistic winter scenarios are also possible, with coronavirus deaths in the thousands. The report makes it clear there is a high degree of uncertainty in the projected death figures. It is not a prediction of what will happen, rather what might. Researchers can model likely scenarios. But simulations rest on assumptions that do not always play out in real life. Change any of the parameters slightly, and you get very different projections. The overall message, however, is clear - prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Currently, coronavirus deaths and cases in the UK are down, which gives the nation a chance to reflect and plan for a second wave. Keeping infection rates low as Britain emerges from lockdown will be critical in controlling the disease. The virus has not gone away. And we do not have a vaccine for it yet. But there are things we can all do, including isolating and getting tested if we develop symptoms. Co-author Prof Dame Anne Johnson, from the Academy of Medical Sciences, said: "Faced with these potential challenges, and after an already tough year, it would be easy to feel hopeless and powerless. "But this report shows that we can act now to change things for the better." It recommends: Health Secretary Matt Hancock said planning was already under way for dealing with the expected surge in demand on the NHS this winter. The government had procured enough flu vaccine to roll out the "biggest flu vaccine programme in history" and was working on setting up a coronavirus vaccination programme should a successful vaccine be found, he added. A government statement said: "We remain vigilant and the government will ensure the necessary resources are in place to avoid a second peak that would overwhelm our NHS."
Mamoudou Gassama won widespread praise after climbing the outside of the building to save the four-year-old. Video showed him being cheered on by spectators as he pulled himself from balcony to balcony to the fourth floor. After meeting him at the Elysee Palace, President Emmanuel Macron said he would be made a naturalised citizen. He personally thanked Mr Gassama, gave him a medal for courage and said he would also be offered a role in the fire service. Mr Gassama is said to have arrived in France last year, taking the long and dangerous journey to Europe via a boat over the Mediterranean to Italy. The drama that thrust him to fame unfolded on Saturday evening on a street in the north of the city. Mr Gassama said he had been walking past when he saw a crowd gathered in front of the building. He told Mr Macron: "I just didn't have time to think, I ran across the road to go and save him. You may also like: "I just climbed up and thank God, God helped me. The more I climbed the more I had the courage to climb up higher, that's it," he added. He said that the boy was crying when he hauled him to safety and had also suffered an injured foot. Firefighters arrived to find the child had already been rescued. "Luckily, there was someone who was physically fit and who had the courage to go and get the child," a spokesperson said. Local authorities quoted by French media said the boy's parents were not at home at the time. The father has been questioned by police on suspicion of leaving his child unattended, judicial sources say. The mother was not in Paris at the time, it is believed. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was among those to praise the 22-year-old's heroism and said she had called him to thank him. She referred to him as the "Spiderman of the 18th", referring to the Paris district where the rescue took place, calling him an "example for all citizens". France's new Malian hero Alex Duval Smith, West Africa correspondent, BBC News Mr Gassama's four-storey dash is a reminder of another Malian hero who gained national prominence in January 2015 during an extremist attack on a Jewish supermarket in Paris. A young Malian employee, Lassana Bathily, was credited with saving the lives of six hostages including a baby when he led them to a safe hiding place, escaped, then directed gendarmes to their rescue. Two weeks later - after six years of struggling to secure legal residency in France - Mr Bathily was given a medal and a French passport by then President François Hollande. In 2016, he wrote a book ''Je ne suis pas un heros'' (I am no hero) and created a charity whose first project was to provide irrigation for his home village in western Mali. Like Mr Bathily's selfless leadership to save the hostages, Mr Gassama's heroic climb to save the boy cements the image of Mali as a country with a culture of old-fashioned public spiritedness.
The victims were found in a container on an industrial estate last week and were initially thought to be Chinese. But Essex Police said it was now in "direct contact with a number of families in Vietnam and the UK" and the Vietnamese government. A number of Vietnamese families have previously come forward fearing their loved ones are among the dead. Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on the night of 22 October - the day before the 39 people were found dead - saying her "trip to a foreign land has failed". Post-mortem examinations are being carried out on the 31 men and eight women to establish the cause of death. Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said: "At this time, we believe the victims are Vietnamese nationals, and we are in contact with the Vietnamese Government." He said police were not in a position to identify any of the victims. The Vietnamese Embassy in London said it was "deeply saddened" and sent its "heartfelt condolences" to the families of the victims. "Specific identities of the victims still need to be identified and confirmed by the relevant authorities of Vietnam and UK," it said. It said it would "closely co-ordinate with the relevant authorities of Vietnam and UK to support the families of the Vietnamese victims, if any, to bring their loved ones home". The father of 30-year-old Le Van Ha, who comes from an agricultural part of Vietnam, previously told the BBC he was convinced his son was among the dead. VietHome, a popular Vietnamese community forum in the UK, said it had passed on the pictures of almost 20 people who have been reported missing to detectives. Earlier, police in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province said they had charged two unnamed people with "organising or brokering illegal immigration". The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, appeared in court on Monday charged with a string of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dubin on a European Arrest Warrant. Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking.
Mr Carney said he expected this would require the creation of about 750,000 jobs and could take three years. The UK unemployment rate currently stands at 7.8%. The governor told the BBC: "We need to provide as much clarity and as much certainty about the path of monetary policy." Speaking to chief economics correspondent Hugh Pym, he said such guidance was needed "so that people… at home, people who are running businesses, across the UK, can make decisions - whether they are investing or spending - with greater certainty about what is going to happen with interest rates". He added: "In effect we are saying - 'we are providing guidance on what could happen with interest rates'." The governor told our correspondent that such a move was needed now "when the recovery is just gathering some steam", and when financial markets might have therefore been expecting an adjustment in interest rates. Mr Carney said that the 7% unemployment figure was not a target, but a point at which the Bank of England would re-examine interest rates. The Bank's guidance is subject to three provisos; breaching any of them would sever the link between interest rates and unemployment levels. These so-called 'knock-outs' are: 'Renewed recovery' Mr Carney said that until the unemployment threshold was reached the Bank would not cut back on its £375bn asset purchase programme, known as quantitative easing (QE). The move sees the Bank of England joining both the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in providing so-called "forward guidance" on interest rate policies. Recent economic figures and surveys have suggested the recovery in the UK economy is picking up pace. On Tuesday, official figures showed manufacturing output surged in June, while surveys have also indicated gathering strength in the service sector and housing market. While upbeat on the prospects for the UK economy, Mr Carney said it had not reached "escape velocity" yet. "A renewed recovery is now under way in the United Kingdom and it appears to be broadening," he said. "While that is certainly welcome, the legacy of the financial crisis means that the recovery remains weak by historical standards and there is still a significant margin of spare capacity in the economy, this is most clearly evident in the high rate of unemployment." 'Confidence boost' John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said the forward guidance would reassure firms. "This will give businesses a much-needed confidence boost when looking to invest, as they know that any plans will not suddenly be derailed by a hike in interest rates," he said. Business lobby group, the CBI, echoed this sentiment, saying greater interest rate certainty and clarity from the Bank should provide a shot in the arm for business and households. But Alan Clarke, director of fixed income strategy at Scotiabank, said unemployment could drop below 7% - the rate that would trigger a re-evaluation of interest rates - well before the Bank of England expects. "Our knee-jerk reaction is that 2016 is a rather conservative assumption," he said. "Our working assumption was that level of the unemployment rate could be reached at least a year earlier." The possibility of an earlier-than-expected rise in rates lifted the pound on the currency markets, with sterling rising by more than a cent against the dollar to $1.5458. 'Significant caveat' There had been widespread expectation that Mr Carney would commit the Bank to the new strategy. With short-term interest rates already at historic lows, the aim is to reduce longer-term interest rates. Knowing interest rates could remain low, potentially for years, gives banks and mortgage lenders the ability to "lock-in" customers at lower rates for longer. Stocks fell after the announcement, with Joshua Mahony, research analyst at trading firm Alpari, saying markets had been underwhelmed by Mr Carney's announcement. He added that rules about the circumstances in which the strategy would be terminated had brought a "significant caveat to the table". 'Dismay' The Chancellor, George Osborne, welcomed the move. "I agree with you that forward guidance can play a useful role in enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy and thereby support the recovery," he said in a letter to the governor. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls also applauded the decision but warned it would be "very important that the MPC [Monetary Policy Committee] stays vigilant to inflationary risks". But pressure group Save our Savers expressed "dismay", saying it would cause further hardship for savers and pensioners, while continuing to favour borrowing at the expense of saving. Meanwhile, Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said guidance "doesn't really take us forward" and called for radical supply side reforms to bring on a surge in productivity. Supply side reforms include lower tax rates and less regulation. The Bank of England's quarterly inflation report was more upbeat about economic growth than it had been in May. It presents its forecasts as a range of possibilities rather than a specific figure, but predicted accelerating growth for the rest of this year, with its central forecast being for growth of about 2.4% in two years' time. It also forecast that the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation was likely to be at its target rate of 2.0% during 2015. The rate of CPI inflation increased to a 14-month high of 2.9% in June, up from 2.7% in May. Housing bubble? At the press conference where the new policy was announced, members of the Bank's MPC were asked whether they were concerned by claims the government's Help to Buy scheme was fuelling another housing bubble. The Help to Buy scheme was launched in April 2013 and allows borrowers to take an equity loan from the government worth up to 20% of the price of newly built homes. That, in turn, enables homebuyers to put down a deposit of as little as 5%. From January next year, it will be extended to help buyers of existing housing. Critics claim the scheme is artificially inflating house prices, leading to future problems when the support is withdrawn. But Bank of England chief economist, Spencer Dale, said it was important to keep the size of the scheme in perspective. "The current run rate of [Help to Buy] is something like 3% or 4% of total housing transactions," he said. "It's done its job in terms of encouraging new house building, but the idea that it is somehow fuelling a housing boom doesn't stack up in terms of the numbers."
Mr Trump tweeted: "Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!" The government has a contract with Boeing to build two or more new planes. The White House appeared to cast doubt on the figures quoted by Mr Trump. "Some of the statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defence," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. The new planes would enter service around 2024. Boeing shares fell more than 1% after the president-elect's tweet, but recovered most of their losses in afternoon trading. Mr Trump would not fly on the new planes unless he won a second term in the 2020 election. The president-elect also announced on Tuesday that Japan's SoftBank has agreed to invest $50bn (£39.4bn) in the US aimed at creating 50,000 new jobs. Mr Trump revealed the plan after meeting SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son at Trump Tower. "Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!" he tweeted. In other developments: 'Could cost more' - Zoe Thomas, BBC New York business correspondent As president and commander-in-chief, Donald Trump will have the power to cancel the contract with Boeing for the new planes. But if he does, it could cost the US taxpayer even more as the new president tries to save money. The US government has already signed a contract with Boeing for $170m (£134m; €158m). Additional funding has also been earmarked for the two new planes. The Government Accountability Office - an independent government auditor - estimates the final cost will be $3.2bn. The planes are still in early design phases, though - much of the money has yet to be spent and has not had a chance to overrun the cost estimates. Negotiation between Boeing and the US government could cut some of the costs, but if Mr Trump pulls out of the Boeing contract entirely the country may lose the money it is already contracted to pay. Mr Trump now uses his own plane, but as president he would travel aboard Air Force One, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. He is known for his admiration of his Trump-branded Boeing 757 jet, boasting to Rolling Stone last year that his aircraft was "bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way". "Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world's most luxurious jetliner?" he said at the time. The president-elect told reporters on Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York that Boeing was "doing a little bit of a number" and the cost was "ridiculous". "We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money," he added. A flying Oval Office Mr Trump's remarks came after the Chicago Tribune published a column early on Tuesday in which Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg suggested the president-elect roll back his anti-trade rhetoric. "If we do not lead when it comes to writing these [trade] rules, our competitors will write them for us," Mr Muilenburg told the newspaper. The Government Accountability Office estimates that the project's overall cost will be $3.2bn, a figure that is expected to rise. The US Air Force said it had budgeted $2.7bn for the project, "but expects this number to change". Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher, in a statement, said: "We are currently under contract for $170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States. "We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the programme, allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer."
By Leo KelionTechnology reporter The 5S introduces a fingerprint sensor built into the phone's main button to identify the user. The 5C comes with a plastic back in a choice of colours. It marks a change of strategy for Apple which had not launched two distinct types of handset at the same time before. The iPhone is the firm's most important product in terms of earnings power. The new fingerprint system can be used to unlock the 5S and provide authentication for purchases from Apple's online marketplace. One analyst suggested the feature would help the handset stand out against its Android rivals. "Touch ID is actually quite an elegant solution to an ever more significant problem: namely, the theft of mobile devices and, perhaps even more critically, the information stored on those devices," said Windsor Holden from the tech consultancy Juniper Research. "Many people haven't yet bothered to implement any kind of security solution on their handsets and for those who have, securing handsets with Pin authorisations can be quite a time-consuming process." However, Apple is not the first phone company to offer such a fingerprint reader. Motorola added the facility to its Atrix handset in 2011, but many owners had problems using it. The feature is not included in the Google-owned business' latest models. The new handsets are compatible with the radio frequencies used by O2 and Vodafone's new 4G services in the UK. The only 4G network the old iPhone 5 could use was EE's. 'Not cheap' The 5S' Sim-free price ranges from £549 for a 16 gigabyte version to £709 for a 64GB model. The basic 5C model, with 16 gigabytes of storage, has been priced Sim-free at £469. That is more than UK retailers had been charging for the 4S with the same amount of memory. "The 5C is far from being 'cheap' as the iPhone 4S [which now costs £349] continues in that role," remarked Ben Wood from tech advisors CCS Insight. There had been speculation that the 4S was going to be phased out. The new iPhones go on sale in the US, UK, China, Australia and Canada among other countries on 20 September. It marks the first time China has been included in the initial wave of sales. China slowdown Its most recent financial report said the iPhone product line accounted for $18.2bn (£11.6bn) of sales in the April-to-June quarter. That figure, which did not include downloads from its App Store, represented just over 50% of Apple's total revenue for the period. However, while the number of iPhones sold was 20% up on the previous year, the company has been losing market share. iPhones accounted for 13% of global smartphone shipments in the second quarter, according to research firm IDC, down from 17% for the same period a year earlier. In contrast Android's share has grown from 69% to 79%. Investors have been particularly concerned about Apple's performance in China. At the start of 2013, chief executive Tim Cook predicted the country would eventually become Apple's biggest market. But the company's latest results showed sales in China and Taiwan were 14% lower in the April-to-June quarter than the previous year. That was despite the fact it saw 12% growth for the same period in the US. "The cheaper iPhone is critical for expanding the addressable market, because many people in China and elsewhere simply can't afford to buy a current generation [top-end] iPhone, especially when it's not subsidised," said Jan Dawson, chief telecoms analyst at the consultancy Ovum. "However, the key risk for Apple in launching a cheaper iPhone is that it may cannibalise sales of the high-end phone. "That would exacerbate a problem Apple's had for the last few quarters, as average selling prices for iPhones have fallen from $608 to $581 in the past year. That in turn squeezes margins and it's only likely to get worse with a cheaper iPhone." The 5S features Apple's new faster A7 processor and adds a chip that continuously monitors motion, providing data for fitness apps. Apple has also made efforts to improve the phone's photography capabilities over the previous generation. It said it had included a 15% bigger sensor, which should help the device cope with low-light situations. The handset also has two LED flashes providing different types of light. They can be combined to help improve colour balance. The firm has also included automatic image stabilisation to prevent shots being ruined by shaky hands, and the ability to shoot video at 120 frames per second so that it can be used to create a smooth slow-motion effect. However, it has not boosted the resolution above 8 megapixels. Apple said using "bigger pixels makes a better picture". But the decision will limit owners' ability to digitally zoom into the view in front of them or to crop photos after they are taken. High-end camera features are a way smartphone-makers have sought to distinguish themselves with Sony and Nokia among recent firms to have claimed their mobiles create the best images. The 5C retains the A6 processor and most of the other specifications of the old iPhone 5 but has a higher capacity battery. The new devices will include copies of Apple's word processing, spreadsheet, presentation and video editing apps which had previously cost extra. Apple also revealed the revamped mobile operating system, iOS 7, would be available to download for use on the earlier iPhone 5 and 4S models as well as some iPads from 18 September. But there was no mention of an NFC (near field communication) chip being included in either new device. The technology can be used to make payments in high street stores and to easily link phones to speakers and other gadgets. It is a common feature in rivals' handsets. Apple's shares fell following the announcements and closed 2.3% below their opening price.
By Stephen EvansSeoul Correspondent, BBC News When outsiders are arrested, they are often sentenced to hard labour, and that's exactly what it is - compounded by the severe oppression of isolation and helplessness. The BBC knows of one former prisoner who was broken psychologically by his treatment. Many years later, he remains too traumatised to talk about it easily. But others have described their experience in detail. In December 2012, North Korea charged missionary Kenneth Bae with acts "hostile to the republic". He had visited the country many times, but was stopped on this occasion and a hard drive with Christian material was discovered. For this "crime", he was sentenced to 15 years hard labour, and only released when his health deteriorated seriously - just as seems to have happened in the current case of Otto Warmbier. After his release, Mr Bae wrote a memoir, "Not Forgotten: The True Story of My Imprisonment in North Korea" in which he said that he was interrogated from 08:00 in the morning until 22:00 or 23:00 at night every day for the first four weeks of his imprisonment. Under this pressure, he wrote the hundreds of pages of confessions his interrogators demanded. Mr Bae said he would work six days a week on a farm, "carrying rock, shovelling coal". His daily routine was to wake at 06:00, eat breakfast, pray, and then be taken to perform the hard labour from 08:00 until 18:00. Under this regime, he lost a lot of weight - an estimated 60lbs (27kg) in the 735 days of his captivity. As his weight dropped, his health increasingly failed and he was repeatedly taken for medical treatment. Apart from the physical toll, there was a psychological pain, a feeling of isolation. He said one interrogator kept telling him: "No-one remembers you. You have been forgotten by people, your government. You're not going home anytime soon. You'll be here for 15 years. You'll be 60 before you go home". He said: "I felt like an insect, tangled in the spider web. Every time I moved it got messier, with no way out." He does say that, later on, after the month of interrogation was over, he was allowed to see emails and messages from people back home (though this may have been both a comfort and a torment). He seems to have been allowed a bible. When he became seriously ill, it looks as though the North Korean authorities became concerned that he might die, with all the diplomatic difficulty that would cause. And so they arranged his release - as it appears might have happened in the case of Otto Warmbier. Dig their own graves Kenneth Bae is an American citizen originally from South Korea, and so spoke Korean. He said he thought his treatment as a prisoner with a cell of his own, including a bed and a toilet, was not as tough as that for North Koreans held in the vast array of camps for ordinary crime or for dissent. He may be right on this. Amnesty International has described the prison camps as harsh beyond endurance. "Hundreds of thousands of people - including children - are detained in political prison camps and other detention facilities in North Korea," it says. "Many of those have not committed any crime, but are merely family members of those deemed guilty of serious political crimes". Amnesty analyses aerial pictures of the camps and says that one of them is three times the size of Washington DC contains 20,000 inmates. According to one former official it had talked to, detainees were forced to dig their own graves and rape was used as punishment, the victims then disappearing. Kenneth Bae does not say he was physically tortured or beaten. His decline in health was because the harshness of the prison regime exacerbated his diabetes, high blood pressure and a kidney condition. That may or may not be the case of Otto Warmbier. But there are questions which the authorities in the United States are surely asking: How did he end up in a coma? And why did North Korea take a year to tell any outside country? If it was because of some sort of physical attack, there might be political pressure on President Donald Trump to get tougher with the regime in Pyongyang. There is one other intriguing question: do prisoners influence their jailers? Stockholm Syndrome is when a hostage comes to identify with the people holding him or her, but is there a reverse Stockholm Syndrome? Kenneth Bae found that his captors were curious about life in the West. They wanted to know how much a house cost, and whether many people really did own their own home and car. "At the beginning, it was difficult but because I speak the language I was able to communicate," he said later, after he was freed. North Koreans had been told of a grim life in America where 99% of people lived in poverty. "I told them most people own a house and a car, and they said: 'That can't be right'."

The boat was carrying between 450 and 600 migrants when it capsized eight miles (12km) off the coast, they say. The numbers have not been confirmed. Authorities say they have rescued 163 people and recovered 51 bodies so far off the port city of Rosetta. Four crew members have been arrested, Egyptian officials said. They are suspected of involuntary manslaughter and human trafficking, judicial officials were reported as saying. The incident came after the EU's border agency warned that increasing numbers of Europe-bound migrants are using Egypt as a departure point. The UN says that more than 10,000 people have died crossing the Mediterranean towards Europe since 2014. The boat was kept off the coast for five days as more and more migrants were brought on board, survivors told the BBC's Orla Guerin in Rosetta. The boat is said to have capsized after a final group of some 150 people were crammed on board. Authorities have been accused of failing to send help fast enough. "Anyone who was saved here, was saved by the local fishing boats," fisherman Abdelrahman Al-Mohamady told the Reuters news agency. The International Organization for Migration said those rescued included 111 Egyptians, 26 Sudanese, 13 Eritreans, a Syrian and an Ethiopian. Many survivors are now being held in police custody. Rescuers are focusing their efforts on the boat's cold storage room, where it is believed around 100 people took refuge during the capsize. There is still uncertainty over the exact number of migrants who were on board the vessel before it capsized, with estimates between 450 and 600. The number of deaths is expected to rise. Some teenage Egyptian survivors, huddled together in the basement of a police station, told the BBC they were trying to reach Italy to find work. The Egypt office of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) say high birth rates and few job opportunities are pushing young Egyptians into taking the risk of a dangerous sea voyage. Authorities say Egyptians in police custody will soon be released but foreign nationals will be held for a few days for questioning as to how they entered the country. Human rights researchers warned last month of a "devastating" lack of information for families of migrants thought to have drowned in the Mediterranean, IOM figures, released in July, suggest 2016 could become the worst year to date for migrant deaths. It said about 3,000 migrants and refugees had lost their lives so far this year trying to cross the Mediterranean. EU border agency Frontex says more than 12,000 migrants arrived in Italy from Egypt between January and September, compared with 7,000 over the same period in 2015. It says Egypt is the "new hotspot" for people smugglers, with concerns that its population of about 80 million people may pose a major problem should it descend into chaos. Frontex director Fabrice Leggeri said that work was being done to determine whether there was a link between the drop in numbers departing from Turkey - where only about 50 people a day are trying to make the journey to reach Greece compared to thousands this time last year - and the increase in numbers from Egypt. However, officials say Libya still remains the biggest departure point with flows at around the same level this year as last year. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
By Dr David WhitehouseAuthor and astronomer Explorers and adventurers often look for new places to conquer now that the highest peaks have been climbed, the poles reached and vast oceans and deserts crossed. Some of these new places are called the poles of inaccessibility. Two of them are particularly interesting. One is called the continental pole of inaccessibility - it's the place on Earth furthest from the ocean. There is some debate as to its exact position but it's considered by many to be near the so-called Dzungarian Gate - a mountain pass between China and Central Asia. The equivalent point in the ocean - the place furthest away from land - lies in the South Pacific some 2,700km (1,680 miles) south of the Pitcairn Islands - somewhere in the no-man's land, or rather no-man's-sea, between Australia, New Zealand and South America. This oceanic pole of inaccessibility is not only of interest to explorers, satellite operators are interested in it as well. That's because most of the satellites placed in orbit around the Earth will eventually come down, but where? Smaller satellites will burn up but pieces of the larger ones will survive to reach the Earth's surface. To avoid crashing on a populated area they are brought down near the point of oceanic inaccessibility. Scattered over an area of approximately 1,500 sq km (580 sq miles) on the ocean floor of this region is a graveyard of satellites. At last count there were more than 260 of them, mostly Russian. The wreckage of the Mir space station lies there. It was launched in 1986 and was visited by many teams of cosmonauts and international visitors. With a mass of 120 tonnes it was never going to burn up in the atmosphere, so it was ditched in the region in 2001 and was seen by some fishermen as a fragmenting mass of glowing debris racing across the sky. Many times a year the supply module that goes to the International Space Station burns up in this region incinerating the station's waste. No one is in any danger because of this controlled re-entry into our atmosphere. The region is not fished because oceanic currents avoid the area and do not bring nutrients to it, making marine life scarce. One future visitor to this desolate place will be the International Space Station. Current plans are for it to be decommissioned in the next decade and it will have to be carefully brought down in the oceanic pole of inaccessibility. With a mass of 450 tonnes - four times that of the Mir space station - it will make a spectacular sight. Sometimes however, it's not possible to bring a satellite or space station down in the South Pacific if ground controllers have lost contact with it. Such a thing happened with the 36-tonne Salyut 7 space station in 1991 which came down in South America or the American Skylab that struck Australia in 1979. No one on the ground was injured, or indeed as far as we know, ever has been hit by a piece of falling spacecraft debris. We will face that problem again next year. Between January and April the Chinese Tiangong-1 will come back to Earth. It was launched in 2011 as China's first space station. The following year it was visited by China's first female astronaut, Liu Yang. Tiangong-1's orbit is decaying as it heads towards re-entry. But Chinese engineers have lost control of it and cannot fire its thrusters to bring it down in the South Pacific. Instead it will come down somewhere between 42.8 degrees north and south. That's between the latitude of northern Spain and southern Australia, and we won't be able to be more precise than that until just a few hours before it burns up. Tiangong-1 is one space station that probably won't join its companions in the remote South Pacific. Dr David Whitehouse was the BBC's science correspondent from 1988 until 2006, and is a former science editor at the BBC News website.
After increasing for eight consecutive weeks, last week sales slipped by 16% to 1.21m (£5.4m), according to industry publication The Bookseller . However the British novelist still topped bestseller lists by a huge margin, with the first book Fifty Shades of Grey shifting 534,088 copies. The trilogy's closest rival Flesh and Bones by Kathy Reichs sold just 23,871. "At some point all books are going to reach their peak," explained The Bookseller's Charts Editor, Philip Stone. "I think Fifty Shades reached its peak the week before last when it sold 1.4 million. The media were talking about it all the time, it was on The One Show and had had a lot of coverage in the press the weekend before." The Fifty Shades stories, dubbed "mummy porn" by the press, feature a steamy relationship between billionaire businessman Christian Grey and "unworldly, innocent" literature student, Anastasia Steele. Sales of the original book Fifty Shades of Grey fell 21% last week with book two, Fifty Shades Darker, and book three, Fifty Shades Freed, suffering 11% and 13% declines to sales of 362,480 and 321,628 respectively. However despite the media attention having "quietened down", Stone says the trilogy will "still comfortably be at number one for a while yet". Summer reads Print sales of book one alone now stand at 2,833,988, putting it in 11th place in a list of the bestselling books since records began in 1998. It is currently behind Dan Brown's Angels and Demons, but has now overtaken huge bestsellers such as Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Stephenie Meyer's Twilight and Eric Carle's The Very Hungry Caterpillar. Stone said this year's summer reads will find it hard to make an impact on the book charts. "Paperbacks of John Grisham's The Litigator and Lee Child's The Affair are on the horizon. They could normally hope to get to number one, but this year I think that's going to be very difficult," said Stone. Other big forthcoming titles this summer include James Patterson's Private Games, Stuart MacBride's Birthdays for the Dead and The Haunting by Alan Titchmarsh. "All of these might have hoped to top the charts in a normal year," said Stone. "But fourth place in the bestseller lists is the new number one!" For the last four weeks, sales of print books have been larger than during the same weeks last year - with sales of E L James' books accounting for a quarter of all book sales during that time.
By Andreas IllmerBBC News New data shows that 152,000 foreign workers - 47% - have been infected. In comparison, it is estimated less than 11% of London's population have been infected since the pandemic began. Without counting the migrant workers, fewer than 4,000 people have tested positive in Singapore. The men, the majority of whom live in large dormitories where several men share a room amid cramped facilities, have essentially been quarantined from the rest of the population since cases exploded in April. Over the past months, infections in both the general population and the migrant dormitories have dropped to almost zero and authorities have just announced a further easing of restrictions for the general population. But Singapore's foreign workers - typically low-wage migrant labourers from South Asia who largely work in the construction and manufacturing sectors - still face restrictions on their freedom of movement which will only be gradually lifted next year. "There is no justification for Singapore to treat migrant workers like prisoners," Alex Au of the charity Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) told the BBC. "Many have been locked in for eight months." Why did the numbers suddenly jump? The new figure is a combination of the normal PCR coronavirus tests - which check whether a person currently has the virus - and a separate drive of serology tests which trace whether a person has had it in the past. Around 54,500 workers have tested positive in the PCR test while another 98,000 were found via the serology test. The previous number had been public before, while the latter was released only on Monday. Singapore's Health Ministry said that by August, the entire worker population had been tested at least once, with either of the two types of tests. The ministry said anyone who tested positive was isolated including those that were found to only have carried the virus in the past. Authorities also said they provided the workers with medical care and assistance. The combined 152,000 cases among the foreign workers make up almost half of the 323,000 workers living in dormitories across the island state. But with some 65,000 workers' serology tests still pending, the percentage might still go up. "These new figures don't surprise us," Mr Au said. "During the middle of the year, workers who tested positive were telling us that they were told to stay in their rooms and not taken into isolation. They remained in contact with their room-mates." "But this is history," Mr Au said. "We're more concerned that Singapore continues to treat the workers as prisoners even though the same statement by the ministry says that 'since October, no new cases were detected in the dormitories on many days'." He argues that since the active infection rate is virtually zero and workers are tested regularly every two weeks, there is no reason to place such hard restrictions on them. Singapore's success and failure The country's first coronavirus cases were were registered in January but a meticulous contact tracing programme managed to keep the infections in check initially. But when the virus began spreading among migrant workers, authorities struggled to trace and isolate all of the infected and numbers began to skyrocket in that community. Out of Singapore's 58,341 total positive PCR tests to date, 93% have been among that migrant worker community. In response to the high infection rate, many of the dorms - often holding thousands of workers - were placed under quarantine in April, essentially locking the workers inside. So far, even healthy workers are only allowed out to be taken to their work sites and occasionally to shop in designated shops near their dorms, Mr Au said. "Workers are still interned and treated like prisoners, used for their labour with no freedom of movement." On Monday, Singapore authorities said that given "the outbreak in the dormitories is under control", restrictions on migrant workers would be progressively eased. In the first quarter of the 2021, some workers will be allowed access to the general community once a month, wearing contract-tracing devices and adhering to the safety measures.
Jeremy Hunt told the BBC he was keeping his options open over how the UK could respond, and refused to rule out sanctions. A group of activists occupied Hong Kong's parliament on Monday over a controversial extradition bill. China warned the UK not to "interfere in its domestic affairs". Mr Hunt said he would not discuss any potential consequences "because you don't want to provoke the very situation you are trying to avoid". "Of course you keep your options open," he added, insisting the UK would not just "gulp and move on" if China cracks down on protesters in the former British colony. Mr Hunt said he "condemned all violence" but warned the Chinese government not to respond to the protests "by repression". Hong Kong was a British colony for more than 150 years, but it was returned to China in 1997 after a treaty was signed by the two countries. The 1984 treaty guaranteed a level of economic autonomy and personal freedoms not permitted on the mainland. Demonstrators argue that a piece of legislation introduced by the city's pro-Beijing leader would make it easier to transfer people to face trial in China. Mr Hunt reiterated that China must honour Hong Kong's high level of autonomy from Beijing. "The heart of people's concerns has been that very precious thing that Hong Kong has had, which is an independent judicial system," Mr Hunt told Radio 4's Today programme. "The United Kingdom views this situation very, very seriously," he added. China's ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office on Wednesday following "unacceptable and inaccurate" remarks. Liu Xiaoming said relations between China and the UK had been "damaged" by comments by Mr Hunt and others backing the demonstrators' actions. He said those who illegally occupied the Legislative Council building and raised the colonial-era British flag should be "condemned as law breakers". He added that it was "hypocritical" of UK politicians to criticise the lack of democracy and civil rights in Hong Kong when, under British rule, there had been no elections nor right to protest. Analysis: Will the war of words endanger relations? By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent Britain's relations with China are at a low ebb. The question now is whether the damage is lasting. China appears determined to use the Hong Kong protests as an opportunity to push back against what it sees as Britain's illegitimate interference in its former colony. But equally Britain seems determined not to be bullied by China. Mr Hunt says the UK has every right to defend a treaty it signed with China in 1984 guaranteeing Hong Kong's freedoms and relative autonomy. The foreign secretary had no option but to summon the Chinese ambassador to London for a diplomatic dressing down. The danger is that this war of words infects the wider relationship and endangers Britain's strategic trading interest with China, something that will only become more important after Brexit. So Mr Hunt threatens "serious consequences" if China fails to honour the so-called Joint Declaration treaty. But he remains tight-lipped about what that might mean, not just because the UK has few diplomatic or economic cards it might wish to play, but also because he does not want to provoke a subsequent clash that might damage Sino-British relations even further. In response to accusations he had sided with the protesters, Mr Hunt said: "I was not supporting the violence, what I was saying is the way to deal with that violence is not by repression." "It is by understanding the root causes of the concerns of the demonstrators - that freedoms that they have had for their whole life could be about to be undermined by this new extradition law," he added. Victor Gao, vice-president of the Centre for China and Globalisation in Beijing, called Monday's occupation of parliament "anarchism", adding "this is to be protested and to be condemned by any government leader with any level of conscience". Mr Gao urged the UK to condemn the violence. He said the "crux of the matter" was "the UK no longer has a say in [how] Hong Kong should be run and managed". In 1984, the Joint Declaration, signed by Margaret Thatcher and the then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, set out how the rights of Hong Kong citizens should be protected in the territory's Basic Law under Chinese rule. Since 1997, Hong Kong has been run by China under the principle of "one country, two systems". Mr Hunt said: "It is very important that the 'one country, two systems' approach is honoured." The foreign secretary would not detail what consequences China might face if it did not honour the treaty, but said the UK had "always defended the values we believe in".
Management on the Tsukuba Express line between Tokyo and the city of Tsukuba say they "sincerely apologise for the inconvenience" caused. In a statement, the company said the train had been scheduled to leave at 9:44:40 local time but left at 9:44:20. Many social media users reacted to the company's apology with surprise. The mistake happened because staff had not checked the timetable, the company statement said. "The crew did not sufficiently check the departure time and performed the departure operation," it said. It added that no customers had complained about the early departure from Minami Nagareyama Station, which is just north of Tokyo. The Tsukuba Express line takes passengers from Akihabara in eastern Tokyo to Tsukuba in about 45 minutes. It is rare for trains in Japan, which has one of the world's most reliable railways, to depart at a different time to the one scheduled. The country's Tokaido line, which runs from Tokyo to the city of Kobe, is by far the world's busiest and carries nearly 150 million passengers a year. Impressed railway users worldwide tweeted the story to their local train operators - particularly in Britain, where rail services are often delayed.
By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website It is the first time a country has considered the DNA-altering technique in embryos and approved it. The research will take place at the Francis Crick Institute in London and aims to provide a deeper understanding of the earliest moments of human life. It will be illegal for the scientists to implant the modified embryos into a woman. But the field is attracting controversy over concerns it is opening the door to designer - or GM - babies. DNA is the blueprint of life - the instructions for building the human body. Gene editing allows the precise manipulation of DNA. In a world-first last year, scientists in China announced they had carried out gene editing in human embryos to correct a gene that causes a blood disorder. Prof Robin Lovell-Badge, a scientific advisor to the UK's fertility regulator, told the BBC: "China has guidelines, but it is often unclear exactly what they are until you've done it and stepped over an unclear boundary. "This is the first time it has gone through a properly regulatory system and been approved." Groundbreaking The experiments will take place in the first seven days after fertilisation. During this time we go from a fertilised egg to a structure called a blastocyst, containing 200-300 cells. The work will be led by Dr Kathy Niakan, who has spent a decade researching human development. Earlier this year, she explained why she had applied to edit human embryos: "We would really like to understand the genes needed for a human embryo to develop successfully into a healthy baby. "The reason why it is so important is because miscarriages and infertility are extremely common, but they're not very well understood." Out of every 100 fertilised eggs, fewer than 50 reach the early blastocyst stage, 25 implant into the womb and only 13 develop beyond three months. And at the blastocyst stage, some cells have been organised to perform specific roles - some go on to form the placenta, others the yolk sac and others ultimately us. How and why this takes place is unknown - but some parts of our DNA are highly active at this stage. It is likely these genes are guiding our early development, but it is unclear exactly what they are doing or what goes wrong in miscarriage. The researchers will alter these genes in donated embryos, which will be destroyed after seven days. The regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), has given its approval and the experiments could start in the next few months. Arguments Paul Nurse, the director of the Crick, said: "I am delighted that the HFEA has approved Dr Niakan's application. "Dr Niakan's proposed research is important for understanding how a healthy human embryo develops and will enhance our understanding of IVF success rates, by looking at the very earliest stage of human development." Dr David King, the director of Human Genetics Alert, said: "This research will allow the scientists to refine the techniques for creating GM babies, and many of the government's scientific advisers have already decided that they are in favour of allowing that. "So this is the first step in a well mapped-out process leading to GM babies, and a future of consumer eugenics." Dr Sarah Chan, from the University of Edinburgh, said: "The use of genome editing technologies in embryo research touches on some sensitive issues, therefore it is appropriate that this research and its ethical implications have been carefully considered by the HFEA before being given approval to proceed. "We should feel confident that our regulatory system in this area is functioning well to keep science aligned with social interests." Follow James on Twitter.
At his trial in Copenhagen, Mr Madsen said the 30-year-old died of carbon monoxide poisoning when the vessel filled with toxic exhaust fumes. But he has admitted dismembering Ms Wall's body and disposing of it at sea. When asked why he did so, he told the court: "I don't see how that mattered at that time, as she was dead." Ms Wall's remains were found by a passing cyclist, 11 days after she interviewed the inventor last August. Mr Madsen is charged with murder, dismemberment and aggravated sexual assault. He faces a life sentence if convicted, which typically means 15 to 17 years in prison without parole. Around 40 witnesses are set to give evidence, as prosecutors attempt to shed light on the circumstances of Ms Wall's death. What do we know about what happened? Kim Wall, a freelance journalist, boarded Peter Madsen's UC3 Nautilus on the evening of 10 August 2017 to interview him for a story. She had left her boyfriend at a going-away party the couple were having ahead of a planned move to Beijing. When she did not return, her boyfriend alerted the police. Peter Madsen was rescued the next morning as his vessel was sinking. He initially told police that he had dropped off the reporter before the vessel began to go down. But he later said she died when a heavy hatch on the submarine fell on her head. Eleven days later, a cyclist found the remains of the journalist's headless torso on a nearby beach. Weeks later, police divers discovered other parts of her body in plastic bags weighed down with metal. The 47-year-old Dane - the skipper and designer of the Nautilus, a 17m- (56ft) long privately-owned submarine - changed his version of events several times. After saying a hatch fell on her head, he maintained instead that she had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine while he was up on deck. He initially denied cutting up her body, but then admitted dismembering it and dumping the body parts in the sea. What was said in court? Peter Madsen appeared calm on Thursday, wearing a black T-shirt, jeans and black glasses. Members of the Wall family were also in the session. His lawyer Betina Hald Engmark told the court he denied murder but admitted "violating the law about indecent handling of a corpse". Explaining his version of events, Mr Madsen said the air pressure on board his submarine suddenly dropped while he was standing on the deck and Ms Wall was in the engine room. He said the vessel began to fill with exhaust fumes but he was unable to open the hatch and enter. "When I finally manage to open the hatch, a warm cloud hits my face. I find her lifeless on the floor, and I squat next to her and try to wake her up, slapping her cheeks," he said. Asked why he had changed his story several times, Mr Madsen said that he had "wanted to spare her family" the "gruesome details." Unclear answers Maddy Savage, BBC News, Copenhagen This is a high-profile trial being covered by more than 100 journalists from around the world, with some queuing for hours in the snow to secure a good view from the court or the press room, where reporters are asked to remain silent and banned from making phone calls. During breaks, Danish journalists here have told me Peter Madsen's black T-shirt and jeans combination isn't unusual attire in courtrooms in Denmark, where casual business dress is common. What fluent Danish speakers here say is significant is that while he is able to speak at length about his own actions and his passion for all things nautical, his answers about what specifically happened to Kim Wall on the night she died have been shorter and less clear. He has continued to deny killing the Swedish journalist, repeatedly describing her death as "terrible". During the session, the prosecution said: The trial is expected to last 12 days over seven weeks, with a verdict expected on 25 April. Who was Kim Wall? The journalist was born in 1987 and grew up in a close-knit community in the small town of Trelleborg in southern Sweden, just across the strait dividing Denmark from Sweden. She studied international relations at London School of Economics and went on to gain a place on the rigorous masters programme of Columbia University's School of Journalism - described as the "Oxbridge of journalism".

The comments came in the Bank's latest quarterly inflation report, which raised the forecast for UK economic growth this year and next. On Wednesday, the UK unemployment rate was reported at 7.6%, down from 7.8%. Chancellor George Osborne said the report was proof the government's economic plan was working. Mr Carney has said the Bank will not consider raising interest rates until the jobless rate falls to 7% or below. The timing of a rise in interest rates could have a significant political impact, but Mr Carney says that will not affect his decision making. In an interview with Channel 4 News he said he would raise interest rates just before the 2015 general election "if I had to". Chances The Bank has given a range of forecasts of when it thinks unemployment could fall to 7%. The most optimistic of these is next year, two years ahead of the time frame it gave in August. The odds for this are low, though. The Bank said: "The MPC [Monetary Policy Committee] attaches only a two-in-five chance to the... unemployment rate having reached the 7% threshold by the end of 2014. "The corresponding figures for the end of 2015 and 2016 are around three in five and two in three respectively." The Bank said on Wednesday that it was not planning to raise interest rates any time soon from their current record low of 0.5%. Even when - and if - the jobless rate reaches 7% the Bank will not automatically move to change the cost of borrowing. Growth outlook Growth for this year is forecast to be 1.6%, up from 1.4% previously thought, and for next year, annual growth is expected to be 2.8%, rather than the 2.5% it predicted in August. The report said: "In the United Kingdom, recovery has finally taken hold. The economy is growing robustly as lifting uncertainty and thawing credit conditions start to unlock pent-up demand." Mr Osborne said: "Our economic plan is working and as the governor of the Bank of England says, the recovery is taking hold." Mr Osborne added that many risks remained but he said the greatest risk would be if his plan was abandoned and quick fixes and more borrowing made a return. The chief policy director of the business lobby group, the CBI, Katja Hall, said: "The Bank's forecast confirms businesses' view that the UK economic recovery is on track. "But there are still hurdles to overcome before growth gets back to a sustainable level, including boosting business investment and trade. " Housing Interest rate decisions are traditionally used to control inflation. There is no obvious pressure for an interest rate rise on that basis, as this week, official figures said inflation had fallen from 2.7% to 2.2% in October. However, house price inflation is at worryingly high levels in certain parts of the country. Mr Carney said this was largely affecting more expensive properties: "In terms of housing valuation, there are clearly areas in the country where valuation is very elevated. "What we are seeing across the UK is the greatest price momentum is for houses that are towards the upper end of the valuation spectrum." One of the Bank's regulatory bodies, the Financial Policy Committee, is charged with looking out for signs of an overheating property market. Mr Carney said it was on the look-out for any bubbles, but that there did not seem to be any looming: "The Financial Policy Committee will be vigilant about potential risks there, but we need to put the pick-up in housing activity in perspective. "Activity levels, while they've picked up, are still running at between two-thirds or three-quarters of historic averages in terms of whether it's transactions or approvals, homebuilding, so there is some room for that to further pick up."
The changes would allow Japanese troops to fight overseas for the first time since World War Two. The bills still need approval from the upper house, but many expect them to eventually be passed into law. The changes are unpopular and thousands demonstrated outside parliament on Wednesday. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pushed for the two bills, arguing it is necessary to expand the role of the military in a doctrine called collective self-defence. But polls show more than half of Japanese citizens oppose them. Reacting to the passing of the bills, China's foreign affairs ministry spokesman Hua Chunying questioned if Japan was "abandoning its pacifist policies", and urged Japan to "stick to the path of peaceful development" and avoid harming the region's stability. South Korea has similarly in the past urged Japan to "contribute to regional peace and security" and called for transparency in Japan's defence policy discussions. What is collective self-defence? Japan's post-World War Two constitution bars it from using force to resolve conflicts except in cases of self-defence. Mr Abe's government has pushed for a change that would revise the laws such that Japan's military would be able to mobilise overseas when these three conditions are met: What's behind Japan's military shift? Most of the opposition lawmakers walked out of the lower house chamber in protest before the vote took place on Thursday, with only members of the small Japan Restoration Party voting against the bills. Mr Abe's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its coalition partners hold a two-thirds majority in the lower house, which is needed to approve bills. The upper house, where the LDP and partners also hold a majority, now has 60 days to rule on the bills. Even if it rejects them, the bills would be sent back to the lower house which can then pass them into law. How Japan's neighbours see the bills China's People's Daily says the new bills, if passed into law, would become Japan's "historical shame". A front-page commentary accuses Japan of giving in to US pressure to do more for the US strategy of rebalancing Asian power, by playing a more active role in the US-Japan military alliance. Beijing's Global Times says that Shinzo Abe, "drunk on his own 'ideals'", has miscalculated. "China is Japan's imaginary enemy, but fighting China is not a risk that Japan can bear... as China is capable of dealing Japan a fatal blow." The official party paper in North Korea, Nodong Sinmun, sees more sinister motives. It says the bills are an attempt to turn Japan into a militarist state by stealth. "If Japan makes desperate efforts to reinvade other counties by invoking the war law, this will bring disasters to its people," it warns. South Korea's foreign ministry, quoted by Yonhap news agency, says Japan should "stick to the spirit of the pacifist constitution". But the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes says that the opposition is expected to launch legal challenges to rule the bills as unconstitutional. Our correspondent says those in Japan who oppose the bills believe they break Japan's explicitly pacifist constitution and also distrust Mr Abe, who is known for his right-wing nationalist views. Organisers of a large protest which took place outside parliament on Wednesday night said about 100,000 people showed up. "I'm angry at both the new security bill and Prime Minister Abe. The bill is against Japan's constitution... Abe does not understand it," student Jinshiro Motoyama told the BBC. Mr Abe first put the changes in motion last year when he sought to reinterpret Japan's pacifist constitution to allow the bills.
Yang was accused of operating one of Africa's biggest ivory-smuggling rings, responsible for smuggling $2.5m (£1.9m) worth of tusks from some 400 elephants. Two Tanzanian men were also found guilty of involvement in the ring. Ivory poaching is said to have caused a 20% decline in the population of African elephants in the last decade. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a global environmental body, says the population of African elephants has fallen to 415,000 - a drop of 110,000 over the last 10 years - as a result of poaching. The illicit trade is fuelled by demand from China and east Asia, where ivory is used to make jewellery and ornaments. Yang was convicted on charges relating to the smuggling of around 800 pieces of ivory between 2000 and 2014 from Tanzania to the Far East. The Tanzanian men were also jailed for 15 years on similar charges. The court in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's main city, has ordered Yang's property to be repossessed. She had been under investigation for more than a year when she was arrested in 2015, following a high-speed car chase. At the time of her arrest, Yang was a prominent businesswoman, operating a Chinese restaurant as well as an investment company in Dar es Salaam. Fluent in Swahili, she had lived and worked in Tanzania since the 1970s, and had served as vice-president of the China-Africa Business Council of Tanzania. Environmental campaigners welcomed the arrest because she was seen as playing a pivotal role in the illegal ivory trade. Most arrests tend to involve minor players.
The figure - the difference between the number entering the country and those leaving - is more than three times higher than the government's target. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire called the rise "deeply disappointing". Figures also show 8.3m people were born abroad - 13% of the UK population - the first time the number has passed 8m. UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the "figures reflect 'Borderless Britain' and total impotence of the British government" and called on the prime minister to negotiate controls on migration from EU countries. Reaction: UK migration reaches record high UK migration figures 330,000 Net migration to UK, in year ending March 2015 28% Increase since March 2014 10,000 higher than previous peak in 2005 61% of EU immigrants who wanted work had definite jobs to go to 9,000 fewer people have emigrated since 2014 It is the fifth consecutive quarterly rise in the net migration figure - with increases in arrivals from both inside and outside the EU. Net migration of EU citizens was 183,000, up 53,000 from the year ending March 2014. The number of those arriving from countries outside the EU was still larger, with net migration measured at 196,000, up 39,000 on a year earlier. Expansion of the EU and the relatively fast recovery of Britain's economy are seen as key factors in the trend. About two-thirds of the EU migrants were said to be workers, and a fifth students. Among the migrants from outside the EU, about a half were students, a quarter workers, and one sixth family members. Among the other ONS findings based on the latest figures were: In 2011, Prime Minister David Cameron said in a speech that he was giving a "no ifs, no buts" promise that he would bring immigration numbers down to "levels our country can manage". During the election campaign he reiterated this promise and said he would not "cave in" and abandon the target. BBC's political correspondent Ross Hawkins said there were "lots of figures, but no cheer for a prime minister who promised he would reduce immigration to levels the country could manage". "His ambition on migration is fast turning into a political embarrassment," he added. After the latest set of figures, the government insisted it was acting to control immigration but said the EU needed to do more to help ease the current migrant crisis across Europe. Mr Brokenshire said that the "reliance that business continues to place on migrant labour" and students staying in the UK after they had finished their studies, were two potential reasons for the rise. "Current flows of people across Europe are on a scale we haven't seen since the end of World War Two. This is not sustainable and risks the future economic development of other EU member states," he added. 'Morally wrong' Yvette Cooper, Labour's shadow home secretary, said David Cameron "needs to stop the dishonesty over his failed immigration target". She said: "All his overblown rhetoric has achieved is a decline in public confidence as the electorate are faced with more broken promises. "But most troubling of all, the net migration target treats immigration and asylum as the same. That is morally wrong and is preventing Britain playing its part in responding to the terrible refugee crisis that stems from Syria and has spread across Europe. The Institute of Directors and think tank British Future said Mr Cameron was "punishing businesses" by trying to fulfil promises to cut immigration. Meanwhile, Jamil Dhanji an immigration barrister told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme migrants were not coming to the UK to claim benefits. "Migrants I see are not coming to this country for that reason," he said. Earlier this week the government announced more details of its new Immigration Bill, which is due to be introduced in the autumn. Under the legislation, illegal immigrants caught working in the UK could face up to six months in prison and late-night takeaways and off-licences will face closure if they are found employing foreigners who have no legal right to be in the country.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin presented the findings as he reasserted the case for the new rail line. The report, from accountants KPMG, says that regions outside London will be the biggest beneficiaries of the new service. But the economic boost will not be felt until 2037, it says. In a speech at the Institute of Civil Engineers, Mr McLoughlin argued that rejecting HS2 would amount to a "national loss of nerve". HS2 was necessary because the "clogged arteries" of the nation's transport system needed a "heart bypass", he said. But Mark Littlewood, director general of the Institute of Economic Affairs, told the BBC: "Any private investor would consider this to be a colossal waste of money. "That is not to say that we don't need to improve capacity. Rail is an extraordinarily expensive way of doing that." The government was asking UK taxpayers to take "a huge gamble on their extremely dodgy numbers", he added. 'Stronger' Mr McLoughlin argued that the benefits of HS2 were not simply faster journey times and new jobs, but up to 500,000 fewer lorry journeys a day on the country's roads, according to a separate report. "High Speed Two will make Liverpool stronger. Manchester stronger. Leeds stronger. Britain stronger", he said. "A £15bn annual boost to the economy. With the North and Midlands gaining at least double the benefit of the south." Dismissing "scare stories" over the budget, he maintained that it would remain £42.6bn, with a contingency fund of £14.4bn. But earlier this week, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) criticised the scheme, saying: "So far, the Department [of Transport] has made decisions based on fragile numbers, out-of-date data and assumptions which do not reflect real life." The committee also said there was no evidence the line would help the growth of regional cities and would instead draw even more business to London. KPMG's report was commissioned by HS2 Ltd, which is a non-departmental public body wholly owned by the Department for Transport. Report author Richard Threlfall, KPMG's head of infrastructure, said: "What I hope this work will do is put some new evidence into the debate, because what we've seen over the last few months is an awful lot of opinions and to be honest not a lot of evidence on the ground as to what effect this will have. "And what our report shows, beyond any reasonable doubt, is that HS2 will deliver massive benefits to the UK economy." 'Creaking' John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, told the BBC: "Businesses up and down the country are absolutely convinced that this is a really important infrastructure project. It is one of the key infrastructure projects for the UK." He argued that simply renovating existing rail lines that were "creaking at the seams" would cause "chaos". The latest study was commissioned by HS2 Ltd, the company responsible for developing and promoting the project. It says Birmingham's economy could be boosted between 2.1% and 4.2% a year, while Manchester would benefit between 0.8% and 1.7%. For Leeds, the boost would be 1.6% and London 0.5%. Wednesday's report calculates the benefits of the project in a different way from previous efforts. Time saved is a less important part of the calculation. Instead, the report includes the benefits of extra seats, which means passengers will be able to work while travelling. It also takes into account the reduction in congestion elsewhere on the network. "The point about High Speed Two is that you won't have to travel on it to gain from the better transport system and economic growth it will support," he said. The high-speed line would run between London and Birmingham from 2026 before being extended to Manchester and Leeds from 2033.
The bleak forecast came in a five-yearly report released by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Climate change remained the biggest threat to the site, the report said. But poor water quality from land-based run-off, coastal development and fishing also posed challenges, it said. "Even with the recent management initiatives to reduce threats and improve resilience, the overall outlook for the Great Barrier Reef is poor, has worsened since 2009 and is expected to further deteriorate," the report released on Tuesday said. Greater reduction of all threats at local and regional levels was needed to stop the decline and improve the reef's ability to recover, it said. 'No quick fixes' The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral structure, rich in marine life. It stretches for more than 2,600km (1,680 miles) along Australia's eastern coast, containing 400 types of coral, 1,500 species of fish and 4,000 types of mollusc. It is a Unesco-listed World Heritage Site, but in recent years the UN body has warned that it could be put on its World Heritage in Danger list because of its worsening condition. Conservationists also fear that proposed development on the Queensland coast, including a planned coal port expansion at Abbott Point, could further harm its health. In its report, the GBRMPA said that investment in some areas of reef management had yielded positive results, for example in reducing pollutant loads entering the reef. It also highlighted examples of species that were making a comeback after years of decline, such as humpback whales and estuarine crocodiles. But it said that climate change was already affecting the reef - causing coral bleaching and ocean acidification - and was "likely to have far-reaching consequences in the decades to come". It said that measures had been put in place to tackle the impact of run-off, but it would be some time before the effect would be felt. Illegal fishing also remained a problem, despite management reforms. On port development, the report said understanding of the effects of dumping dredged sediment at sea remained incomplete. The expansion at Abbott Point involves dredging to improve access to the port, with the sediment to be dumped within the marine park - a move criticised by conservationists. The GBRMPA report coincided with the release of a strategic assessment by the government on measures needed to protect the reef. "Together, these reports reinforce there are no quick fixes and it will take time to turn around the overall health of the reef with a concerted effort from government, industries and communities," said Environment Minister Greg Hunt in a statement. About A$180m (£99m, $167m) was being invested annually in the reef's health, he said, and an "overarching framework" for managing the reef from 2015 to 2050 was being developed. "We are absolutely committed to protecting and improving the health of this iconic natural wonder so it can be enjoyed by future generations," he said.
By Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter ARM instructed employees to halt "all active contracts, support entitlements, and any pending engagements” with Huawei and its subsidiaries to comply with a recent US trade clampdown. ARM's designs form the basis of most mobile device processors worldwide. In a company memo, it said its designs contained “US origin technology”. As a consequence, it believes it is affected by the Trump administration's ban. One analyst described the move, if it became long-term, as an “insurmountable” blow to Huawei’s business. He said it would greatly affect the firm's ability to develop its own chips, many of which are currently built with ARM’s underlying technology, for which it pays a licence. These are used in the Chinese company's 5G base stations and computer servers in addition to its smartphones. Cambridge-headquartered ARM had been described as the UK's largest tech firm until its takeover by a Japanese fund. It employs 6,000 workers and lists eight offices in the US. In a statement on Wednesday it said: "ARM is complying with the latest restrictions set forth by the US government and is having ongoing conversations with the appropriate US government agencies to ensure we remain compliant. "ARM values its relationship with our long-time partner HiSilicon and we are hopeful for a swift resolution on this matter." Huawei has issued a brief statement of its own. "We value our close relationships with our partners, but recognise the pressure some of them are under, as a result of politically motivated decisions," it said. "We are confident this regrettable situation can be resolved and our priority remains to continue to deliver world-class technology and products to our customers around the world." What is ARM? ARM is a chip designer founded in 1990. In September 2016 it was acquired by Japanese telecoms giant Softbank, but remains based in Cambridge, UK. ARM does not manufacture computer processors itself, but rather licenses its semiconductor technologies to others. In some cases, manufacturers only license ARM's architecture, or "instruction sets", which determine how processors handle commands. This option gives chip-makers greater freedom to customise their own designs. In other cases, manufacturers license ARM's processor core designs - which describes how the chips' transistors should be arranged. These blueprints still need to be combined with other elements - such as memory and radios - to create what is referred to as a system-on-chip. As a result, when you hear talk of a device being powered by a Samsung Exynos, Qualcomm Snapdragon or Apple A11 chip - or one in a Huawei smartphone - it is still ARM's technology that is involved. ARM's US headquarters are in San Jose, California, and the firm has offices in Washington, Arizona, Texas and Massachusetts. Read more: What is ARM and why was it worth $24bn? ‘Unfortunate situation’ ARM’s staff were informed of the decision on 16 May, following the US Commerce Department’s move to add Huawei to its “entity list” of companies with which American firms could no longer do business. The BBC has also seen a company memo dated 18 May detailing the implications of the export ban. On Monday 20 May, US government officials issued a 90-day reprieve on some of the restrictions in order to minimise immediate disruption. But ARM believes that the temporary licence involved does not apply to it. A spokesman for ARM declined to offer any additional clarity about the current status of its Huawei contracts. According to one memo, ARM staff were instructed to suspend all interactions with Huawei and its subsidiaries. It advised staff to send a note informing Huawei (or related) employees that due to an “unfortunate situation”, they were not allowed to “provide support, delivery technology (whether software, code, or other updates), engage in technical discussions, or otherwise discuss technical matters with Huawei, HiSilicon or any of the other named entities”. ARM staff that come into contact with employees at industry events must “politely decline and stop” any conversations about the business, the guidance said - stressing that individuals could be held personally liable for breaking the trade rules. The ban also appeared to apply to ARM China, the China-based company in which ARM Holdings owns a 49% stake. It was set up as a joint venture with a Chinese investment consortium last year in order to enable ARM to develop, sell and offer support for its products in the region. 'Insurmountable obstacle' Huawei told reporters on Tuesday that its “plan B” for software would be to develop its own operating system, something it has already been working on for some time. However, it will be significantly more difficult for the firm to source home-grown components of sufficient quality. Huawei currently sources some of its chips from HiSilicon, which it owns. However, while produced in China, HiSilicon’s chips are built using underlying technology created by ARM. While HiSilicon and Huawei are free to carry on using and manufacturing existing chips, the ban would mean the company could no longer turn to ARM for assistance in developing components for devices in future. HiSilicon's upcoming processor, Kirin 985, is due be used in Huawei devices later this year. According to a source at ARM, it is not expected to be affected by the ban. However, the next iteration of the chip has not yet been completed - and is likely to need to be rebuilt from scratch, the source said. Huawei also uses ARM's designs for its recently unveiled Kunpeng chips. These are used to power its TaiShan-series computer servers, which are designed to provide cloud computing and storage to clients. In addition, the company told analysts in January that the Tiangang chip at the heart of its 5G base stations is also ARM-based. "The problem of the whole telecoms industry is that so much of it is based on the exchange of technology between different companies - whether that's chip companies, software providers or the makers of other hardware," commented Alan Burkitt-Gray, editor-at-large of the telecoms news site Capacity Media. He added that Huawei would likely face other problems licensing 5G-related tech from others, and in turn US-based companies would now be unable to licence the Chinese company's 5G inventions. "This will carve out a chasm in the industry between Huawei-originated intellectual property and the rest of the world's," he said. "It's just a total mess and it's happened at a critical time for the rollout of 5G." The relationship between ARM and Huawei engineers is tight - earlier this month Huawei announced its intention to build a research centre only 15 minutes from ARM’s headquarters in Cambridge, UK. "ARM is the foundation of Huawei’s smartphone chip designs, so this is an insurmountable obstacle for Huawei,” said Geoff Blaber, from CCS Insight. "That said, with an abundance of companies in Huawei’s supply chain already having taken action to comply with the US order, Huawei’s ability to operate was already severely affected.” What is not yet clear is whether ARM is acting on its own interpretation of the US rules, or whether it has been advised by the Commerce Department. "If that interpretation is correct, that’s going to affect every semiconductor company in the world,” remarked analyst Lee Ratliff, from IHS Markit. "They’re not going to be able to easily replace these parts with new, in-house designs - the semiconductor industry in China is nascent.” _______ Additional reporting by Leo Kelion Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Mr Corbyn rejected David Cameron's claim that targeting so-called Islamic State there would make Britain safer. His intervention - which puts him at odds with a number of his MPs - was criticised by a shadow cabinet member. The frontbencher said there would be resignations if Mr Corbyn ordered the shadow cabinet to back his stance. Labour is divided on whether to support Mr Cameron's call for air strikes, with about half of the shadow cabinet believed to back intervention. Mr Corbyn's decision to write to MPs before the shadow cabinet had reached agreement was criticised by a senior shadow minister, who told BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith: "There will be resignations among senior members of the shadow cabinet over this." He said Mr Corbyn's letter had led to a breakdown of trust within the shadow cabinet, which had not been consulted before it was sent. A British serviceman would be "insulted" by Mr Corbyn's "ridiculous party games" he said, adding: "We are becoming a complete joke." Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn had earlier told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg he found the case for strikes "compelling". Downing Street sources said: "It's not a great surprise that Jeremy Corbyn has come out against air strikes. The issue is how many Labour MPs feel able to support him." Shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott told Channel 4 News Thursday's shadow cabinet meeting had been "lively". She said 70% of Labour members were against air strikes, but that some MPs "seem to have been persuaded by David Cameron". After "a weekend's reflection", she predicted, these MPs would "see things differently". Momentum, the grass roots organisation formed by Corbyn supporters after his leadership victory, has emailed Labour members urging them to lobby their local MPs to oppose air strikes. The Labour row comes after Mr Cameron spent nearly three hours trying to convince MPs action against IS in Syria would make Britain "safer" and would be part of a "comprehensive" strategy alongside key allies to defeat the group. He told MPs the UK was already a target for IS and could not "outsource our security to allies". The prime minister said he would only hold a Commons vote authorising action if he was certain he could win it - which would depend on persuading Labour MPs to back him. The vote could come as soon as next week, with former Tory rebels and some Labour backbenchers indicating they now backed action. Speaking on BBC Question Time, former London mayor Ken Livingstone, recently appointed onto Labour's defence review team, said he suspected its MPs would be given a "free vote" on Syria, meaning they would not be forced to follow a party line. Labour's shadow cabinet met after Mr Cameron's statement and Mr Corbyn said it would continue trying "to reach a common view" on Syria on Monday. Ground forces But in his letter to MPs, he said: "We've all been horrified by the despicable attacks in Paris and are determined to see the defeat of ISIS. "Our first priority must be the security of Britain and the safety of the British people. The issue now is whether what the PM is proposing strengthens, or undermines, our national security. "I do not believe that the PM today made a convincing case that extending UK bombing to Syria would meet that crucial test. Nor did it satisfactorily answer the questions raised by us and the Foreign Affairs Committee. "In particular, the PM did not set out a coherent strategy, coordinated through the UN for the defeat of ISIS. Nor has he been able to explain what credible and acceptable ground forces could retake and hold territory freed from ISIS control by an intensified air campaign. "In my view, the PM has been unable to explain the contribution of additional UK bombing to a comprehensive negotiated political settlement of the Syrian civil war, or its likely impact on the threat of terrorist attacks in the UK. "For these, and other reasons, I do not believe the PM's current proposal for air strikes in Syria will protect our security and therefore cannot support it." Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond earlier said he believed the government was building a consensus for military action. He told BBC News: "From what I have seen from the response to the prime minister's statement today it feels to me that we are building a consensus now for military action in Syria as part of a package of British response which will include a humanitarian and a very strong diplomatic/political strand as well."
The air force chief showed an image of jets over Beirut, Lebanon, and said the planes had "already attacked twice on two different fronts". Israel recently carried out scores of air strikes in Syria. The F-35, from the world's priciest military programme, has been criticised both for cost and combat effectiveness. Last year, Defence Secretary James Mattis had to defend the programme after then President-elect Donald Trump tweeted criticising its huge price, said to be close to $100m (£74m) per plane. 'Game-changer' Maj Gen Amikam Norkin told heads of 20 foreign air forces meeting in Israel: "We are flying the F-35 all over the Middle East and have already attacked twice on two different fronts." He did not specify the targets. "You know that we just won the Eurovision with the song 'Toy.' Well, the F-35 is not a toy," he said. Israel, the first country outside the US to acquire the single-seat fighter, has received nine of the 50 F-35s it has so far ordered, and could take up to 75. In Israel it is referred to by its Hebrew name "Adir" (Mighty). The jets are believed to be the F-35A variant - conventional takeoff and landing. The BBC's Tom Bateman in Jerusalem says Israel's claim to have used it in an operational strike even before the Americans may be designed as a further show of military strength, as it believes elite Iranian forces are trying to entrench themselves in Syria to threaten Israel. Israel said its recent air strikes inside Syria targeted Iranian military infrastructure, in response to rocket fire aimed at Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights. Iran has hundreds of personnel in Syria, who it says serve as military advisers to the Syrian army. It has also sent thousands of volunteer fighters in support of the Syrian government. The US has given Israel more military aid than any other country in the world - currently around $4bn a year - and its laws on arms sales require that Israel always maintains military superiority in the Middle East. F-35: Why its maker says it's so advanced Israel has praised the Lockheed Martin F-35 as a "game-changer". This may not even be its first use by Israel. Its military is often quiet about its operations and there were reports that the stealth fighter had been used operationally as early as January last year. The US has certainly put a lot of faith in a programme that is expected to run through to 2070 and is projected to cost $1.5tn by then. However, it has also come in for heavy criticism and not just over the price. An influential military blog in 2015 reported that the F-35 lacked manoeuvrability and was unable to beat an F-16 in a dogfight. It was also reported to have cockpit visibility issues. Analysts say the emphasis on stealth capabilities may have compromised air-to-air effectiveness.
By Steven BrocklehurstBBC Scotland News June Almeida went on to become a pioneer of virus imaging, whose work has come roaring back into focus during the present pandemic. Covid-19 is a new illness but it is caused by a coronavirus of the type first identified by Dr Almeida in 1964 at her laboratory in St Thomas's Hospital in London. The virologist was born June Hart in 1930 and grew up in a tenement near Alexandra Park in the north east of Glasgow. She left school with little formal education but got a job as a laboratory technician in histopathology at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. Later she moved to London to further her career and in 1954 married Enriques Almeida, a Venezuelan artist. Common cold research The couple and their young daughter moved to Toronto in Canada and, according to medical writer George Winter, it was at the Ontario Cancer Institute that Dr Almeida developed her outstanding skills with an electron microscope. She pioneered a method which better visualised viruses by using antibodies to aggregate them. Mr Winter told Drivetime on BBC Radio Scotland her talents were recognised in the UK and she was lured back in 1964 to work at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School in London, the same hospital that treated Prime Minister Boris Johnson when he was suffering from the Covid-19 virus. On her return, she began to collaborate with Dr David Tyrrell, who was running research at the common cold unit in Salisbury in Wiltshire. Mr Winter says Dr Tyrrell had been studying nasal washings from volunteers and his team had found that they were able to grow quite a few common cold-associated viruses but not all of them. One sample in particular, which became known as B814, was from the nasal washings of a pupil at a boarding school in Surrey in 1960. They found that they were able to transmit common cold symptoms to volunteers but they were unable to grow it in routine cell culture. However, volunteer studies demonstrated its growth in organ cultures and Dr Tyrrell wondered if it could be seen by an electron microscope. They sent samples to June Almeida who saw the virus particles in the specimens, which she described as like influenza viruses but not exactly the same. She identified what became known as the first human coronavirus. Mr Winter says that Dr Almeida had actually seen particles like this before while investigating mouse hepatitis and infectious bronchitis of chickens. However, he says her paper to a peer-reviewed journal was rejected "because the referees said the images she produced were just bad pictures of influenza virus particles". The new discovery from strain B814 was written up in the British Medical Journal in 1965 and the first photographs of what she had seen were published in the Journal of General Virology two years later. According to Mr Winter, it was Dr Tyrrell and Dr Almeida, along with Prof Tony Waterson, the man in charge at St Thomas's, who named it coronavirus because of the crown or halo surrounding it on the viral image. Dr Almeida later worked at the Postgraduate Medical School in London, where she was awarded a doctorate. She finished her career at the Wellcome Institute, where she was named on several patents in the field of imaging viruses. After leaving Wellcome, Dr Almeida become a yoga teacher but went back into virology in an advisory role in the late 1980s when she helped take novel pictures of the HIV virus. June Almeida died in 2007, at the age of 77. Now 13 years after her death she is finally getting recognition she deserves as a pioneer whose work speeded up understanding of the virus that is currently spreading throughout the world.
The deal between the two firms should have been completed earlier this year but it was delayed by a hold-up in regulatory approvals. The sale will see the end of production of mobile phones by Nokia. "Today we welcome the Nokia devices and services business to our family," said Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella. "The mobile capabilities and assets they bring will advance our transformation." The Finnish company will now focus on networks, mapping services and technology development and licences. Two Nokia plants will remain outside the deal - a manufacturing unit in Chennai, India, subject to an asset freeze by Indian tax authorities, and the Masan plant in South Korea, which it plans to shut down. Former Nokia chief executive Stephen Elop has become executive vice president of the Microsoft devices group, in charge of Lumia smartphones and tablets, Nokia mobile phones, Xbox hardware, Microsoft Surface, and Perceptive Pixel (PPI) products.
He said: "I killed about three of them... I don't know how many bullets from my gun went inside their bodies. It happened and I cannot lie about it." His statement came hours after his spokesman denied that Mr Duterte had personally killed anyone. The recent controversy began on Wednesday at the president's palace. He told a group of business leaders gathered there: "In Davao I used to do it [kill] personally. Just to show to the guys [police] that if I can do it why can't you. "And I'd go around in Davao with a motorcycle, with a big bike around, and I would just patrol the streets, looking for trouble. I was really looking for a confrontation so I could kill." Mr Duterte was mayor of the southern city for two decades, during which time he earned a reputation for brutally suppressing crime, and was accused of sponsoring death squads. He first spoke about killing three men in 2015, while still mayor of Davao. He said that the men were suspected of kidnapping and rape. Speaking to the BBC on Friday, Mr Duterte's spokesman Martin Andanar said the president's apparent admissions were simply tough talk and that he was "not a killer". "That is the style of the president, ever since he was a mayor he would talk that way," Mr Andanar said. "We do not take all of those statements literally. We take it seriously, but we don't take it literally." But hours later Mr Duterte reiterated his earlier admissions. But he denied reports that he had shot people who were kneeling down with their hands tied behind their back. 'Not an addict' Speaking to the BBC after a news conference, Mr Duterte pledged to wage his war on drug dealers "until the last day of my term". Nearly 6,000 people are said to have been killed by police, vigilantes and mercenaries in the Philippines since Mr Duterte launched a drug war after being elected in May. Critics say he has encouraged police and vigilantes to shoot drug dealers and users on sight. Mr Duterte denied that he was a drug addict himself, despite using the powerful pain killer Fentanyl. "I'm not an addict," he said. "Only when it is prescribed. Addiction is only with regularity, my friend." Mr Duterte has admitted to using the drug, saying he had migraines and issues with his spine. Mr Andanar dismissed claims that the president was suffering from the side effects of Fentanyl, which can cause confusion, anxiety and even hallucinations. "[Mr Duterte] is healthy," Mr Andanar said. "We've seen him work till the wee hours of the morning. He is in a hurry, [and is] very impatient because our country has been dragged down to the toilet." The president's admission on Wednesday sparked calls for his impeachment from opposition leaders and rights groups. It was the latest in a series of controversial claims by Mr Duterte since he became president. Senator Leila de Lima, a staunch critic of Mr Duterte, has said his admission could be grounds for impeachment.
He successfully channelled the energies of Singaporeans to create what has often been described as an economic miracle, a mixture of private and state capitalism. Mr Lee made Singapore prosperous, modern, efficient and practically corruption-free - and overseas investors flocked in. But while he was admired for his economic success, many expressed concern over his record on human rights. Lee Kuan Yew was born on 16 September 1923 in Singapore, the son of third-generation Chinese immigrants. His upbringing had a strong British influence and his grandfather dubbed him Harry Lee, a name by which he was known through most of his early life. Mr Lee went to an English school in Singapore but his further education was disrupted by the Japanese occupation, which began in 1942. For the next three years, he was involved in the black market and also used his command of English to work for the Japanese propaganda department. After the war he went briefly to the London School of Economics before going up to Cambridge, where he took a double first in law. During his time in England, Mr Lee became a devotee of the BBC Home Service, forerunner to Radio 4, and took time out to campaign for a university friend who was contesting a parliamentary seat in rural Devon. Mr Lee, a committed socialist from his student days, returned to Singapore where he became a prominent trade union lawyer. Prime Minister In 1954, he was a founder and the first general secretary of the People's Action Party (PAP), a post he was to hold for most of the next 40 years The PAP won the majority of seats in the 1959 elections and Singapore passed from overall British control and became a self-governing state. Mr Lee took Singapore into a merger with Malaysia in 1963 but it was short-lived. Ideological tensions and a series of violent clashes between ethnic groups led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation to become fully independent. It was a difficult move for Lee, who saw the alliance with Malaysia as a way of finally throwing off the area's colonial past. He described it as "a moment of anguish". Commercial and military links with Malaysia were maintained, however, and Britain was encouraged to keep its base in Singapore for the joint defence of the island and Malaysia. Mr Lee set about a huge programme of reform, designed to transform Singapore from the "cesspool of squalor and degradation" described in one contemporary account to a modern industrialised state. Corporal punishment To do this he maintained tight political control over every aspect of the city state, making it one of the world's most regulated societies. Mr Lee detained some of his critics without trial, restricted the media and foreign publications, and arrested a number of journalists. "Freedom of the press, freedom of the news media, must be subordinated to the overriding needs of the integrity of Singapore," he said. He justified his actions by claiming that the newspapers were being financed by hostile interests abroad. Mr Lee contended that in a developing nation some freedoms had to be sacrificed. The alternative to anti-communism was communism, and the West's concept of liberal democracy could not apply. However, some of his critics argued that holding all the parliamentary seats should have provided him with enough security to avoid having to use such repressive measures. As a committed anti-communist, he was accused of adopting a communist-style regime to further his policies although, unlike many communist regimes, the people of Singapore benefited financially from his rule. From 1960 to 1980, Singapore's GNP per capita increased 15-fold. Population control Israel provided the model, surrounded as it was by hostile Arab states. "Like Israel, we had to leapfrog the rest of the region, and attract multinational companies," Lee said. He understood the importance of building a good relationship with China, something that was helped by his friendship with the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. Deng, who visited Singapore in 1978, expressed admiration for Lee's economic policies; Mr Lee was impressed with the reforms that Deng instituted in China. Mr Lee introduced measures that stamped out the corruption that had been endemic in the former colony and embarked on a programme of low-cost housing and industrialisation to provide employment. He also worked to pull together the island's diverse ethnic groups to create a unique Singaporean identity, based on multiculturalism. He was a great believer in the efficacy of corporal punishment, having been on the receiving end himself while at school. "I bent over a chair and was given three of the best with my trousers on," he later recalled. "I have never understood why Western educationalists are so much against corporal punishment. It did my fellow students and me no harm." By the time he left office, corporal punishment was an intrinsic part of Singapore's judicial system being prescribed for more than 40 offences. Mr Lee also took steps to control Singapore's fast-growing population, introducing a family planning campaign and, through the tax regime, penalising those who had more than two children. Industrial power Later he tried to encourage more graduate women to marry by exempting them from the child control policies that still applied to their less well educated sisters. Singaporeans were taught how to be courteous, how to be less noisy, when to flush the lavatory, and not to use chewing gum. There was no graffiti because the government said there should be none. "We were called a nanny state," Mr Lee once told the BBC. "But the result is that we are today better behaved and we live in a more agreeable place than 30 years ago." However, despite higher living standards and increasing affluence, younger voters were rejecting him in significant numbers and siding more with the opposition. In January 1985, he refreshed his cabinet with young technocrats, and despite the economy going through a rough patch his party continued to win landslide victories at the polls. When Mr Lee stepped down in 1990, after winning no fewer than seven elections, he was the longest-serving prime minister in the world. He remained active in politics, taking a leading part in the campaign to persuade more Singaporeans to speak Mandarin Chinese as well as English. During his time in office Singapore moved from being a developing nation to one of the foremost industrial powers in Asia. There are those who believe that development was bought at the price of personal freedom and often cite Lee's penchant for suing media organisations who disagreed with him. But Mr Lee stood by his record until the end. "I did some sharp and hard things to get things right. Maybe some people disapproved of it… but a lot was at stake and I wanted the place to succeed, that's all," he said in a 2011 collection of interviews. "At the end of the day, what have I got? A successful Singapore. What have I given up? My life."
The announcement follows the twin air disasters which forced its nationalisation last year. The airline said it had "offered jobs" to 14,000 of its 20,000 workforce. The move was expected and follows the appointment of new chief executive Christoph Mueller in May. "We are technically bankrupt," Mr Mueller told a news conference. "The decline of performance started long before the tragic events of 2014." The airline is operating as normal and no flights are currently affected. In March last year, Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared with 239 passengers and crew aboard. The plane is still missing. Four months later, flight MH17 was shot down by a suspected ground-to-air missile while in Ukrainian airspace, with the loss of 298 passengers and crew. The two disasters proved to be the final straw for the already struggling business, which had reported losses for several years as a result of strong regional competition. Rebranding Mr Mueller was making his first public appearance as chief executive since being hired by the carrier's owner, Malaysian state fund Khazanah, to lead the restructuring. He has previously had senior roles at Ireland's Aer Lingus, Belgium's Sabena and Germany's Lufthansa airlines. Famed for slashing jobs at the airlines, he has earned the nickname "the Terminator". Analysis: Jennifer Pak, BBC Malaysia correspondent: For more than a decade, Malaysia Airlines lurched from one restructuring to the next, but it was hard for many Malaysian taxpayers to understand the extent of the problem. In-flight service remained one of the best in the region and up until the twin tragedies of MH370 and MH17, the carrier had a good safety record. The new chief executive, Christoph Mueller, detailed the structural issues today. For example, he said Malaysia Airlines management staff were spread out across more than 12 buildings, which meant departments were spending a lot of time to communicate with each other. He also stated that the airline was "technically bankrupt". Mohshin Aziz, an aviation analyst at Maybank, told the BBC that no management official "had the balls to admit that" in the past. He said the slashing of a third of the work force was a promising sign of real change. But Mr Mueller doesn't have much time to revive Malaysia's national icon. British Airways, for example, recently restarted flights from London to Kuala Lumpur, which is Malaysia Airline's flagship route. I recently flew that route and had a row of four seats to stretch my legs. The staff told me there were plenty of empty seats in the double-decker Airbus A380 aircraft. Malaysia Airlines faces stiff competition from legacy carriers, as well as low-cost carriers, such as AirAsia X. Malaysia Airlines had previously disclosed plans to cut 6,000 jobs, shrinking its workforce to 14,000. Mr Mueller said the airline could not expect that all of the job offers it had made to existing staff would be accepted. He said this was because the company expected staff to have received offers from rival carriers. "We will embark on a second round in two weeks' time and that will allow others to accept our offers and that may change the numbers," he added. Malaysia Airlines plans to announce a rebranding on 1 September. Mr Mueller would not be drawn on whether this would mean a change to its name, but said "all constellations were open". He admitted that in certain markets Malaysia Airlines was a tarnished brand, but he would not say whether the rebrand would involve a change in name, logo or other alterations. He also would not be drawn on whether the airline would withdraw from some costly long-haul flights to Europe. In more general terms, he said it was possible the airline might reduce the frequency of flights on certain routes, or reduce the size of aircraft on those routes. The carrier would look at joint ventures before closing routes, Mr Mueller said, and would be having conversations with potential partners in the coming weeks. The airline considered long-haul flights to and from London to be among its flagship routes, he said, so would not be altering them. In a statement, the airline said its immediate priority was to "stop the bleeding" in 2015, then to stabilise next year and start growing again by 2017.
"I am Chelsea Manning," Pte First Class Manning said in a statement to NBC's Today programme. "I am a female." The 25-year-old said he had felt female since childhood, wanted at once to begin hormone therapy, and wished to be addressed as Chelsea. Pte Manning faces 35 years in prison for crimes including espionage. The soldier could be released on parole after at least seven years in jail, his civilian lawyer David Coombs has said. Mr Coombs has asked President Barack Obama to pardon Pte Manning, and has pledged to appeal against the verdict and sentence. Pte Manning will serve the sentence at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and on Thursday, Mr Coombs indicated the soldier was willing to take legal action to force the prison to provide hormone therapy if authorities refused. He said Pte Manning had not indicated whether he wanted to undergo sex reassignment surgery. "The ultimate goal is to be comfortable in her skin and to be the person that she's never had an opportunity to be," he said. Asked why Pte Manning was making this announcement now, the day after sentencing, Mr Coombs said: "Chelsea didn't want to have this be something that overshadowed the case." Pte Manning's struggles with gender identity formed a key part of the defence through the weeks-long court martial. Defence witnesses, including therapists who had treated Pte Manning, testified that the soldier had spoken of wanting to transition to being a woman, suggesting that these problems had affected his mental health. Wig and lipstick Pte Manning's former Army supervisor testified that the accused had sent him a photograph of himself wearing a blond wig and lipstick. US military prosecutors, meanwhile, described Pte Manning as a notoriety-seeking traitor and asked for a 60-year sentence in order to deter future intelligence leakers. Pte Manning, who grew up in the US state of Oklahoma and in Wales, joined the Army in 2007 to help pay for university and, according to court martial defence testimony, to shake off a desire to become a woman. The soldier trained as an intelligence analyst and was deployed to Iraq in 2009. There, Pte Manning became disillusioned with the war and felt increasingly isolated from friends and family. In May of that year, Pte Manning initiated what subsequently became one of the largest leaks of classified US government documents ever - hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and battlefield reports from Afghanistan and Iraq.
By Celia HattonBBC News, Beijing Known as the Diaoyu Islands in China, and the Senkaku Islands in Japan, the territory is easy to miss on a regional map. This tiny string of five uninhabited islets and three barren rocks lies almost exactly between mainland China and southern Japan. For decades, Japanese authorities have controlled the islands, prized for their strategic location in the East China Sea and possible oil and gas deposits below. But in the past few years, Beijing has reinvigorated its campaign to assert its historical ownership over a minute piece of territory that's causing huge regional arguments. China's Communist leaders first disputed Japan's ownership of the islands in the 1970s, but both countries agreed to leave the problem to future generations. The issue heated up again in 2012, when the Japanese government purchased the islands from a private landowner. Japanese nationalists wanted to develop the islands, Tokyo said. It wanted to halt that plan, partly to placate China. Few in Beijing believed that explanation. Instead, the change to the status quo gave China an opportunity to exercise its growing political appetites. "When Xi Jinping came to power, he changed the basic approach of Chinese foreign policy," explains Renmin University Professor Cheng Xiaohe. "From maintaining the status quo to maintaining a low profile to a new approach of doing something." To the frustration of China's leaders, Japan has not publicly acknowledged Beijing's claim. So, to pressure Tokyo, Beijing stepped up patrols of the area. Chinese fighter jets regularly fly above the islands, while naval ships sail below. "If Japan refuses to talk about this problem, China has to cruise around the Diaoyu Islands to assert China's sovereign rights," explains Liu Jiangyong, a professor at Tsinghua University. Last November, Beijing made a surprise move, declaring new air traffic restrictions in a zone covering the disputed area. Some countries, including the United States, ignored China's rules, but it is all part of the country's long-term strategy, says Dr Cheng. "China's design [is] to reserve some kind of rights and freedoms for China to take military action if something happens in Diaoyu Islands or some other disputed area," he explains. 'One inch of territory' Inside China, the government is using another tool - anti-Japanese propaganda - to keep the island issue at the forefront of foreign policy. Even young Chinese audiences are regularly reminded of unresolved tensions dating back to World War Two. "Shoot Japanese Demons", an online videogame, was released in February by People.com, a government website. Players choose a so-called Japanese warlord from a gallery of real historical figures and then score points by shooting the chosen person with a gun. The game is cartoonish, but it's important to ask: is Beijing's campaign all just a game? Would Xi Jinping really go to war for a speck of uninhabited territory? Well, yes. "Yes, the islands are small, but from Chinese perspective, one inch of territory is big enough for China to fight for," says Dr Cheng. Ultimately, it's a circular problem. The symbolic value of these islands will continue to rise as long as both countries push to control them. "If China and Japan had a friendly relationship, military interest in the islands would drop," Dr Liu adds. Outside the Japanese embassy, security remains tight. Forbidding 4m-high (13ft) walls prevent anyone from looking in, and grim-faced soldiers circle the exterior. There are many reasons why China and Japan would avoid a territorial war, including rising trade links and the threat of Washington's involvement. But the presence of these guards reminds those both inside the embassy and out that the threat of a serious military confrontation is never far away.
A photograph of Nyima Tenzin was kept in the corner of his house, surrounded by warm light spilling from oil lamps. The hum of prayers continued in the next room, where family members, relatives and Buddhist monks were chanting. Days earlier, the 51-year-old soldier had died in a landmine blast near Pangong Tso Lake in the Himalayan region of Ladakh, where Indian and Chinese troops have been facing off in recent months. Sources in the Indian army told the BBC that he was killed by an old mine left from the 1962 war the two countries fought. "On 30 August, around 10:30 in the night, I got a call, saying he was injured," Tenzin's brother, Namdakh, recalled. "They did not tell me that he had died. A friend confirmed the news to me later." Tenzin, his family told the BBC, had been a member of the Special Frontier Force (SFF), a covert military unit largely comprising Tibetan refugees. It reportedly has about 3,500 soldiers. Tenzin was a refugee too and he had served in the force for more than 30 years, his family said. Little is known about the SFF, whose existence has never been officially acknowledged by Indian officials. But it's also a well-known secret, familiar to military and foreign policy experts as well as journalists who cover the region. Yet, Tenzin's death - in the last weekend of August amid rising tensions between India and China - prompted the first public acknowledgement of Tibetans' role in the Indian military. The people of Leh, the capital of Ladakh where Tenzin lived, and the Tibetan community came together to bid him farewell in a grand funeral, complete with military honours, including a 21-gun salute. Senior BJP leader Ram Madhav attended the funeral and placed a wreath on Tenzin's coffin, which was draped in the flags of India and Tibet and was carried to his home in an army truck. Mr Madhav even tweeted, describing Tenzin as a member of the SFF and "a Tibetan who laid down his life protecting" India's borders in Ladakh. He later deleted the tweet in which he also referred to an Indo-Tibet border rather than an Indo-China border. Although the government and the army made no official statement, the funeral was widely reported in national media, which interpreted it as a "sharp signal" and a "strong message" to Beijing. "Till now this [the SFF] was a secret, but it has been acknowledged now and I am very happy," said Namdakh Tenzin. "Anyone who serves should be named and supported. "We fought in 1971, which was kept a secret, then in 1999 we fought Pakistan in Kargil, that was also kept a secret. But now for the first time it has been acknowledged. This makes me so happy." The SFF, experts say, was created after the 1962 war between India and China. "The aim was to recruit Tibetans who had fled to India, and had high altitude guerrilla warfare experience, or were part of Chushi Gandruk, a guerrilla Tibetan force, which fought China till the early 1960s," said Kalsang Rinchen, a Tibetan journalist and filmmaker, whose documentary Phantoms of Chittagong is based on extensive interviews with former SFF troops. In 1959, after a failed anti-Chinese uprising, the 14th Dalai Lama fled Tibet and set up a government in exile in India, where he continues to live. Tens of thousands of Tibetans followed him into exile and sought asylum in India. India's support f the Dalai Lama, and the refugees who came with him, quickly became a source of friction between the two countries. India's humiliating defeat in 1962 added to the tension. BN Mullik, the then chief of Indian intelligence, is reported to have set up the SFF with the help of the CIA. The extent of Washington's role is disputed - while some sources say it was a purely Indian initiative with "full endorsement" from the US, others say that some 12,000 Tibetans were trained by US special forces and partly funded by the US. "Most of the training was given by Americans," Jampa, a Tibetan refugee, who joined the SFF in 1962, told the BBC. "There was one guy from the CIA who spoke in broken Hindi - he trained four of our men who understood Hindi as most of us didn't know Hindi. Then those four men trained others." The force only recruited Tibetans initially but later expanded to include non-Tibetans. Throughout, experts say, the force has reported directly to the federal cabinet and is always headed by a high-ranking official from the army. "The primary motive was to fight China covertly and gather intelligence," Mr Rinchen said. The Chinese deny any knowledge of the SFF. "I'm not aware of Tibetans in exile in the Indian armed forces. You may ask the Indian side for this," Chinese spokesperson Hua Chunying said in a recent press conference. "China's position is very clear. We firmly oppose any country providing convenience in any form for Tibet independence forces' separatist activities," she added. Beijing still governs Tibet as an autonomous region of China. And its relations with India have worsened since June when border clashes between the two sides left 20 Indian soldiers dead. India said Chinese soldiers also died in the clash but Beijing has not commented on this. The cause of the decades-long tension is the poorly demarcated border between the two countries - it cuts through miles of inhospitable terrain. "It's an odd situation for India," says professor Dibyesh Anand, head of the School of Social Science at the University of Westminster. "India has essentially indicated to China that it will use Tibetans against them, but officially they will not say that." "We did everything the Indian army does, but we never got the usual military honours or acknowledgement - it still makes me sad," Mr Jampa, the former SFF fighter, said. It's hard to say what impact India's recent subtle acknowledgement of the SFF will have on its relations with China. But the tensions between the neighbours certainly worry more than 90,000 Tibetans in India, many of whom still hope to return to Tibet some day. But India feels like home too. "We all feel proud that Tenzin gave his life for two of our countries - India and Tibet," said his brother-in-law, Tudup Tashi. You may also be interested in:
Global government requests were up by 24% to almost 35,000 in the first six months, the social media giant said. The amount of Facebook content restricted because of local laws also rose about 19% in the same period. News of the increase comes as Facebook fights its largest ever US court order to hand over data from 400 people. Photographs, private messages and other information involving people in a benefit fraud trial were given to a New York court last year, but the request was only made public in August. "We're aggressively pursuing an appeal to a higher court to invalidate these sweeping warrants and to force the government to return the data it has seized," the social media giant said in a blog on Tuesday. The world's largest social network also said that they "scrutinize" every government request for legal sufficiency and "push back hard when we find deficiencies or are served with overly broad requests." Privacy Facebook has been under fire for its use of user data in recent years, fuelling online privacy concerns. Last month, Facebook admitted that it would change the way it does research on users after a controversial experiment where it manipulated some users newsfeeds to affect their emotions. Meanwhile, the tech giant has rolled out a series of features this year to help users protect their personal information. In April, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg introduced new features that allowed users to limit the amount of personal information they share with third-party mobile apps. In 2012, Facebook had settled privacy charges with US authorities over a case that it had deceived users and forced them to share more personal information than they had intended. In September, Google reported a 15% increase in the number of requests in the first half of this year compared to the prior six months, and a 150% rise in the last five years, from governments around the world to reveal user information for criminal investigations.
Of that total, 21% was made up of fruit and vegetables and 41% of bakery items. Using its own data and industry-wide figures, it also estimated that across the UK food industry as a whole, 68% of salad to be sold in bags was wasted - 35% of it thrown out by customers. The retailer is introducing measures to reduce wastage including developing promotions for smaller bags of salad. The latest figures published by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) suggested 15 million tonnes of food went to waste in the UK in 2010. Figures for 2012 will be published next month. Publishing its food waste figures for the first time, Tesco said that, in the first six months of this year, its stores and distribution centres generated 28,500 tonnes of food waste. The largest proportion of that - about 11,700 tonnes - was classified as "bakery", and the second largest category, making up around a fifth of the total, was fruit and vegetables. Dairy products and convenience foods such as ready meals each made up 8% of the waste, impulse buys such as confectionery and soft drinks accounted for 6%, and meat, fish and poultry for 5%. The remainder of the waste was split between other categories such as alcohol, cereals and frozen food. Tesco said that, where possible, if food could not be sold it was either donated to poverty charity FareShare, converted into animal feed for livestock, or was recycled into renewable fuel. Prime Minister David Cameron recently praised the FareShare charity and, on Monday, his spokesman told a regular Westminster briefing: "There will be widespread concern about levels of food that go to waste and that's why the prime minister has noted the excellent work that FareShare does." Tesco has also given wastage estimates for the 25 best-selling products across the UK food industry as a whole. The figures were based on waste data from Tesco supermarkets, distribution centres, suppliers and producers - combined with Wrap figures on levels of waste in UK homes. It estimated that 24% of grapes were wasted between the vine and the fruit bowl and that a fifth of all bananas were unused - with one-in-10 thrown away by customers. It also suggested some 40% of apples and 47% of bakery items in the UK were wasted. 'No quick fix' Tesco said it addressing the problem of waste by ending multi-buys on large bags of salad, removing "display until" dates from fresh fruit and vegetables, using smaller cases in stores, and rearranging 600 in-store bakeries to reduce the amount of bread on display. And it said it was involved in trials with apple growers to reduce pests and disease. Other measures to tackle the problem would include providing simple tips to customers about storing fruit, Tesco said. It said it would also share tips about how to use leftover bread, adding it was working with grape and banana suppliers to improve delivery times and conditions. Matt Simister, Tesco's commercial director of group food, said there was "no quick-fix single solution" to tackling food waste. "Families are wasting an estimated £700 a year and we want to help them keep that money in their pockets, rather than throwing it in the bin," he said. "We're playing our part too and making changes to our processes and in store. "Ending multi-buy promotions on large packs of bagged salads is one way we can help, but this is just the start and we'll be reviewing what else we can do." He said Tesco was working with its suppliers to try to cut waste at all stages of the journey from farm to fork. Richard Swannell, director of Wrap, said: "We welcome Tesco's approach to tackling food waste across their whole supply chain, and by identifying the hot spots they can tackle these areas effectively. "Food waste is a global issue and collaborative action is essential if we are to successfully reduce food waste and reap the financial and environmental benefits of doing so." Investigative food journalist Joanna Blythman, meanwhile, said consumers were being "ripped off" by supermarket promotions - especially those involving fresh food. "What we could say to consumers is 'wise up'," she told the BBC News Channel. "The minute you walk into the supermarket you may be able to get a few bargains but, more likely than not, you'll be nudged into buying stuff you didn't really want or need and it will go in the bin."
It will focus on removing those antibiotics that can have an impact on human health, but keep those necessary for poultry welfare. Chicken served in its US restaurants will be free of such antibiotics within two years, it said. In Europe, McDonald's is also phasing out the use of certain "critically important" antibiotics. There are concerns that the overuse of antibiotics in chicken may reduce the drugs' effectiveness in humans. McDonald's has been battling to win back customers amid slowing sales. Many poultry producers in US give their birds antibiotics to make them grow faster. But overuse of the drugs could lead to them becoming less effective in treating illness and disease in humans. Worldwide like-for-like sales at McDonald's - which strip out the effect of new restaurants opening - fell by a more-than-expected 1.8% in January on the back of a supplier scandal in China. Its image was also tarnished after a human tooth was found in a portion of fries in Japan last year. The firm issued an apology in January. Healthy chickens In a statement, Marion Gross, senior vice-president of North America supply chain, said that McDonald's "believes that any animals that become ill deserve appropriate veterinary care and our suppliers will continue to treat poultry with prescribed antibiotics". But after treatment, the bird "will no longer be included in our food supply". However, McDonald's chicken will be given ionophores, an antibiotic which helps keep chickens healthy but is not used for humans. The company also said that US dairy products, such as low fat white milk and fat-free chocolate milk, would be derived from cows that have not been treated with rbST - an artificial growth hormone. "While no significant difference has been shown between milk derived from rbST-treated and non-rbST-treated cows, we understand this is something that is important to our customers," Ms Gross said. The changes come in response to growing consumer demand for food made with natural ingredients only. Last month, Swiss food giant Nestle announced that it would be removing all artificial flavours and colours from its chocolate products in the US.
The telecoms regulator said hackers used a Chinese address to plant a malicious code that hit networks at six organisations on Wednesday. Officials said they were continuing to investigate the origins of the attack. North Korea has been blamed for previous attacks in 2009 and 2011. "Unidentified hackers used a Chinese IP address to contact servers of the six affected organisations and plant the malware which attacked their computers," said Park Jae-moon of South Korea's communications regulator. "At this stage, we're still making our best efforts to trace the origin of attacks, keeping all kinds of possibilities open," he said. Computer vaccines Officials stressed that the IP address did not reveal who was behind the attack, as hackers can route their attacks through addresses in other countries to obscure their identities. The discovery has strengthened speculation that North Korea was behind the attack, the BBC's Lucy Williamson reports from Seoul. An unidentified high-ranking official from South Korea's presidential office, quoted by Yonhap news agency, said the government had "all possibilities open, while bearing a strong suspicion that North Korea conducted the attack." Intelligence experts believe that North Korea routinely uses Chinese computer addresses to hide its cyber-attacks. A taskforce is being formed to analyse the virus and stop further attacks, and free computer vaccines have been handed out to South Korean companies, our correspondent adds. Korea's Communications Commission (KCC) said that the attacks on all six organisations appeared to come from a single entity. The networks had been attacked by malicious codes, rather than distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks as initially suspected. "We have said many times that hacker attacks are a global problem, which are anonymous and cross-border. Hackers often use the IP addresses of other countries to carry out their attacks," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said. 'Persistent hacking' Following Wednesday's attack, the KCC raised its cyber-attack alert levels to "caution," the third highest out of five levels. The banks and broadcasters were reportedly able to restore their main networks by Thursday morning. Around 32,000 computers were affected by the incident, and some services at Shinhan bank, including internet banking and ATM machines, were disrupted. So far no damage had been detected in public institutions and infrastructure, the KCC was quoted as saying by Yonhap. The incident comes with tensions between the two Koreas high. North Korea has stepped up rhetoric in recent days in response to fresh UN sanctions over its nuclear test in February and joint annual military drills between the US and South Korea, which it bitterly opposes. On Thursday, Pyongyang threatened to attack American naval bases in Japan and an air base in Guam. On 15 March, North Korea's KCNA news agency accused the US and its allies of "intensive and persistent" hacking attacks on its internet servers. Meanwhile, the United Nations has for the first time set up a commission of inquiry into human rights abuses in North Korea, which it says may amount to crimes against humanity. The UN Human Rights Council in Geneva unanimously adopted a resolution that was proposed by the European Union and Japan and backed by the US.
Mr Rouhani agreed a number of major deals, including a €22bn ($24bn; £17bn) contract to buy 118 Airbus planes. Earlier, French carmaker Peugeot said it had agreed a joint venture in Iran worth €400m. Mr Rouhani's Europe tour comes after the lifting of international sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme. Mr Rouhani's five-day visit to Italy and France is the first by an Iranian president in nearly two decades. Iranian diplomats had reportedly requested that no wine be served at Mr Rouhani's lunch meeting with French President Francois Hollande, leading French officials to postpone the meeting until after lunch. 'Seduced by Iran' The Iranian president was received at a welcome ceremony on Thursday at the Invalides monument in Paris. Mr Rouhani said: "The time is ripe for both countries to enhance their relations. "Diplomacy at the negotiating table can be quite effective - it can through logic and prudence... resolve problems," he said. Analysis: BBC's Lucy Williamson, Paris It was an august setting to begin a new relationship. In the sombre courtyard of the Invalides they walked together, two small figures against the expanse of stone and history. Black robes and tailored coat, side by side before the military band. But the symbolism of this relationship is, for now, less important than the opportunities it offers. With European companies lining up for a share in the Iranian market, President Rouhani is marking his return from isolation with a shopping trip. Top of his list in France is planes - badly needed to restore Iran's crumbling commercial aviation industry - and the resurrection of a joint-venture between French and Iranian carmakers. Political locks may be harder to unpick. Iranian memories are full of French support for Arab nations - including Tehran's arch-enemy in the Iran-Iraq war - and more recently of France's tough stance during the nuclear negotiations last year. Both sides have said they want to begin a new chapter, and President Hollande is keen to talk to Mr Rouhani about the conflict in Syria, which the two leaders see very differently. But when it comes to compromise, the boundaries are - for now - clearly drawn. Reports that the Iranian delegation requested all wine be removed from the table during President Rouhani's state reception were met with a polite invitation to meet Mr Hollande after lunch.. All new relationships have their awkward moments. This one at least contains a helpful lesson for their future relations: neither country enjoys deferring to outsiders. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said the two countries were "being reunited". "France has for a long time turned itself towards Iran, fascinated by its history, attracted by its culture, seduced by this great nation which is so incomparable," he said. Mr Rouhani later held talks with his French counterpart Francois Hollande, and both leaders attended a ceremony where business deals were signed. Mr Hollande stressed that the new relationship with Iran depended on Tehran keeping to the commitments it made in last month's international nuclear deal. "Each stakeholder has got to respect their commitments. Therefore we must be able to ensure with all due attention that what was agreed can be realised. And that's a condition for everything." Mr Rouhani insisted that his country would meet its obligations. Iran is likely to need hundreds of new aircraft in the coming years as it re-establishes commercial air travel previously restricted by the sanctions. Iranian state TV said earlier that as part of the deal with Airbus, 100 planes would be delivered to Iran over four years. Meanwhile, Peugeot said it had signed a joint venue with local carmaker Khodro to manufacture cars in Iran. Oil firm Total and rail company SNCF also announced deals with Iran. Mr Rouhani's visit also sparked protests from activists over Iran's human rights record, and use of the death penalty. One woman suspended herself from a bridge near the Eiffel Tower, with a banner reading: "Welcome Rouhani, executioner of freedom".
By Padraig BeltonTechnology of Business reporter "Winter is coming," laughs Lin Liu, a 29-year-old Shanghai tech worker. Electric vehicles, industrial robots, and microchip production all slowed recently. Big firms like Alibaba, Tencent, and search engine Baidu have slashed jobs. Overall, one in five Chinese tech companies plans to cut recruitment, says jobs site Liepin.com. "And I think this slowing down will continue," says Ms Liu, who's run a tech start-up and the Slush start-up conferences in Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Nanjing. The US-China trade war is partly why - both nations imposed tariffs on each other's goods in 2018. But China's economy, which has enjoyed double-digit growth in six of the last 15 years, will slow to 6.3% growth in 2019, predicts the International Monetary Fund. This is still double the world's average, but China's slowest growth since 1990. And China's start-up scene, boasting a third of the world's "unicorns" - start-ups worth more than $1bn (£769m) - is plotting a "strategic restructuring" as the economy and tech sector cool, Ms Liu says. "What drove things completely insane was too much money," argues William Bao Bean, managing director of Chinaccelerator, a Shanghai-based start-up accelerator. There was a "real push for economic growth from the government" and big funding from state coffers, he says. This has levelled off. "Before, you could get $3m with two people knocking and a smile. Now you can get $3m with two people knocking and a smile and six weeks of meetings," he says. Dockless bike sharing rivals Mobike and Ofo were pedalling off with investors' money last year in a bitter duel for market share. That sector's now hit the brakes. "You definitely have a lot more people walking around those bikes than riding those bikes," says Gregory Prudhommeaux, who has worked with Shanghai start-ups since moving from France in 2005. Ofo owes one billion yuan ($148m; £114m) in unpaid debts. In December, a Beijing court placed it and chief executive Dai Wei on a blacklist after Ofo defaulted on suppliers' payments. And Mobike lost 4.6 billion yuan in 2018 and won't make a profit until 2021, says China Tonghai Securities, a Hong Kong broker. It quietly doubled its Beijing fees last month, with one yuan now buying you a 15-minute ride instead of half an hour. China's 6,200 online peer-to-peer lending platforms, like Weida and Yirendai, were a thriving bubble two years ago. But 80% have closed or hit major difficulties since, says the Yingcan Group, a Shanghai consultancy. Amid a government crackdown, this number might dip below 300 by the year's end. Belt tightening has been one result, as companies shed "the coffee machine in the office and the subsidised taxi ride home after 9pm", says Michael Norris, a Shanghai-based Australian who researches China's tech scene. "The bar and restaurant scene is slowing down, people are eating out less on expenses," agrees Mr Prudhommeaux. Tech companies are also pushing employees harder, resulting in rising complaints about the common "996" working week - 9am to 9 pm, six days a week. For companies, "the feeling at the top end of town is that the easy growth is gone," says Mr Norris. One reason is that China's market is more saturated. While only 56% of the population is on the internet, Tencent, Shenzhen's internet giant that last year became Asia's first $500bn-plus company, says this percentage includes most of the people who buy online. More Technology of Business "When you account for those who are too young or old to own a smartphone, and people who have a little bit of money, we're basically at saturation," Mr Norris says. So it's pricier to get customers. This means start-ups are having to link up with China's online giants. "The cost of user acquisition is really high; start-ups cannot afford it any more," complains Ms Liu. It could cost 300 yuan to acquire a new user, but that user may only ever spend 200 yuan, she says. In the last year or so, "over half the unicorns" aligned with either Tencent or Alibaba, making "a bifurcation of the market into clans", says Mr Bean. For start-ups wanting to train artificial intelligence models on big amounts of data, linking with Tencent, Alibaba, or Baidu creates huge advantages. China has "a huge amount of data already", says Shenzhen resident Yang Yang, founder of Unimaker, a 3D printing start-up. And big data helps Chinese start-ups localise and improve to beat overseas companies trying for a foothold. This is how Meituan-Dianping, a Beijing group-buying site, beat off rivals Groupon, Didi Chuxing, Uber, and iQiyi, says Mr Yang. Also, start-ups are selling more to businesses instead of consumers. One or two years ago, "you'd see virtual reality start-ups targeting customers, like in the gaming industry", says Ms Liu. "Now they're targeting businesses, like real estate and medical companies." But there are advantages to China's tech bubble deflating. For investors, things are "actually much better in a downturn than a hot period, so good companies have a chance to shine," says Mr Bean. When everybody can get money, "it makes it difficult for the best to stand out", he says. And increasing protests at the "996" working week give start-ups a chance to offer something different. If you "don't want to be following 996 at big companies, maybe come work for my company," says Mr Prudhommeaux. The slowdown may also force companies to focus more, believes Mr Norris. Chinese tech and internet firms are "rather infamous" for rambling across very different lines of business, he says. Meituan, for example, is an online food platform that also acquired a bike share scheme. But these non-core businesses drag down the companies' margins, argues Mr Norris. "There's going to be a refocus on good, competent strategy - the art of choosing what not to do," he predicts. So China's sunny gold rush days may be ending, but the coming winter may deliver a cold blast of efficiency that many tech firms need.

Dozens remain, refusing to believe the authorities' pledge of a safe exit. The tense stand-off follows a day of bloody clashes on Friday in which 173 people died and 1,000 Brotherhood supporters were arrested. The group has called for daily protests after a crackdown on their camps in Cairo on Wednesday left hundreds dead. Meanwhile the interim prime minister has proposed legally dissolving the Brotherhood. The movement is demanding the reinstatement of Mohammed Morsi - Egypt's first democratically elected president - who was removed by the army last month and replaced with an interim government. Also on Saturday, the Muslim Brotherhood said on its Facebook page that Ammar Badie, the son of the movement's spiritual leader, General Guide Mohamed Badie, was one of those killed during protests on Friday. Fear for lives Police have surrounded the al-Fath mosque in Cairo's Ramses Square, where Morsi supporters were holed up. Security forces had earlier entered the building to try to persuade them to go. Television pictures showed the security forces in riot gear on the steps outside, with an angry crowd also in attendance. The security forces did fire into the air to keep the crowd away as some Morsi supporters were escorted from the mosque. But correspondents say dozens more remain in the main hall, refusing to leave. BBC Arabic spoke to two of the protesters inside who said that they feared for their lives. They told the BBC that they did not trust the authorities' promises of a safe exit. They said there were two bodies inside - one of them of a woman who died after tear gas was fired by police into the mosque overnight and another of a man taken into the building after sustaining bullet wounds. They said the protesters had drinking water but there was only one toilet. Among those in the mosque are four Irish citizens - sisters Omaima, Somaia and Fatima Halawa, along with their brother, Ibrihim. Their father is Hussein Halawa, imam of Ireland's largest mosque, in Clonskeagh, Dublin. Some 1,000 people were trapped in the mosque after violence in Ramses Square on Friday. Security officials quoted by the official Mena news agency said "armed elements" had opened fire from inside the mosque. The building quickly filled with dead and injured - as well as those fleeing the violence. Egypt's interior ministry said in a statement on Saturday that 1,004 "Muslim Brotherhood elements" had been arrested on Friday, 558 of them in Cairo. UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said that while peaceful protests and the right to assembly had to be respected, "evidence does point to some of the violent provocation coming from some of the protesters themselves". "People really need to be reminded to put Egypt first, rather than their different positions," she said. Meanwhile the Brotherhood said that Ammar Badie, 38, had died of a bullet wound in Ramses Square on Friday. His father has been charged with inciting violence but his whereabouts are unknown. The secretary-general of the Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party, Mohammed al-Beltagi, says his 17-year-old daughter, Asmaa, died in earlier protests. 'Day of anger' The Muslim Brotherhood has been on the streets since the army deposed Mr Morsi on 3 July. On Wednesday at least 638 people died when the Brotherhood's two protest camps in Cairo were cleared, a move that sparked international condemnation. Friday's protests - dubbed a "day of anger" - were called in response to Wednesday's bloodshed. The violence erupted shortly after midday prayers when thousands of Morsi supporters answered the Brotherhood's call for rallies across Egypt. On Saturday, the government updated the casualty figures from the day's violence, putting the number killed across the country at 173, 95 of them in Cairo. It added that 1,330 people had been wounded. The number of police killed since Wednesday was listed as 57, with 563 wounded. Egypt's interim leaders have imposed a state of emergency, with dusk-to-dawn curfews in the capital and other areas. The interior ministry says police have been authorised to use live ammunition "within a legal framework". Correspondents say the atmosphere in Cairo is tense, with many armoured personnel carriers deployed on the streets. The army has blocked off all entrances to Tahrir Square - the focus of demonstrations that led to the toppling of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011. Meanwhile, groups that support the army-backed interim government - the National Salvation Front and Tamarod - are calling for counter-demonstrations in response to the Muslim Brotherhood protests. Mr Morsi is now in custody, accused of murder over a 2011 jailbreak. His period of detention was extended by 30 days on Thursday, state media said.
A French government official said a man who had been injured in the attack on the Promenade des Anglais died of his injuries. The man, who has not been named, leaves behind a wife and two children. The attack, which has been claimed by so-called Islamic State, was carried out by a Tunisian man living in France. Eighty-three people died on the night of the attack on Bastille Day and three have since died in hospital of injuries sustained when Mohamed Lahouaiej-Bouhlel drove a lorry into celebrating crowds. Among the dead were 10 children and teenagers.
By Katherine SellgrenBBC News education reporter It shows a rise in satisfaction levels since 2005, especially in areas such as academic support and assessment. The Higher Education Funding Council for England analysed the results of the annual National Student Survey of more than 2m final-year UK students. It shows overall satisfaction levels have risen by five percentage points, from 80.2% in 2005 to 85% in 2013. Feedback Satisfaction with "assessment and feedback" rose by 12 percentage points during this period, as did happiness with "academic support". The results show differences depending on the subject a student chose, with students in creative art and design, computer science and mass communication and documentation less satisfied over time. Among the more satisfied were those studying veterinary sciences, physical sciences, mathematical sciences and geographical studies. The study also found that black African students were more satisfied overall than white students, but those from a black Caribbean background were less content. The analysis covers the core population of students who have been part of the National Student Survey cohort since 2005 - those registered at English, Welsh and Northern Irish universities who are not funded by the National Health Service. 'Source of intelligence' Hefce chief executive, Prof Madeleine Atkins, said: "The NSS is an invaluable source of intelligence for universities and colleges. "The reports we are publishing today confirm the robustness of the NSS, and the value it adds to UK higher education. Hefce will now work with the other UK funding bodies, universities and colleges, and students, to make refinements for the future." A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "We welcome this research on the NSS, which shows that students have become more satisfied with their higher education experience. "However, we are not complacent and are looking for institutions to analyse the data published today to improve the learning experience they offer to all students." Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: "Despite unpopular and chaotic university funding changes from governments in the past nine years, students remain satisfied with their degrees and it is the staff in our universities who deserve enormous credit for that. "Satisfaction remains high even though staff pay has been driven down, workloads have increased and some students expect more for their massively increased fees - despite the fact that money merely covers the funding this government has cut. "The government and universities cannot continue to simply expect more for less. We need proper investment and commitment to higher education if we are to continue to satisfy students in our universities and be a key player on the world stage."
Antares, built by Orbital Sciences Corp, combusted seconds after leaving the seaside launch pad at Wallops Flight Facility. The cause of the cargo ship malfunction has yet to be determined. The initial planned launch of the spacecraft on Monday was delayed due to a yacht in the surrounding danger zone. The flight was expected to be the third contracted mission with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The rocket was due to carry nearly 5,000lb (2,200kgs) of supplies to six astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS). It included equipment for astronauts to conduct tests on blood flow to the human brain and to analyse meteors. There was also equipment for experiments to examine the growth of pea shoots in orbit and how the body's immune system reacts to space travel. More than 1,300lb (600kg) of food was on board, including pre-packaged meals and freeze-dried crab cakes. "We will understand what happened, hopefully soon, and we'll get things back on track," said Frank Culbertson, executive vice-president of Orbital Sciences. "We've all seen this happen in our business before, and we've all seen the teams recover from this, and we will do the same." No-one was injured, said Mr Culbertson, and an investigation team was going through the data to try to establish the cause. He added it was possible his company's staff had triggered the rocket's destruct mechanism after the launch went wrong, but that he was not certain. Investigating the crash The examination of debris around the site would begin on Wednesday morning, Mr Culbertson said. But he urged locals to avoid the crash area as the rocket had been carrying "hazardous materials". "Certainly don't go souvenir hunting along the beach," he said. Antares rocket Medium expendable launcher + 5,000 kg payload capacity First flew: 2013 Stages: 2 Height*: 41.9 m First-stage thrust: 734,000 lbs Russia's space agency conducted its own launch to the ISS on Wednesday. The operation, which by chance was on the same day as the Antares launch, was planned long before Wednesday's accident, officials said. Investigators will not jump to conclusions but one line of inquiry will surely focus on the AJ-26 engines used to lift the rocket away from the pad, says BBC science correspondent Jonathan Amos. "These are actually modified Russian-built power units that were originally developed for the ill-fated Soviet Moon rocket, the N-1. "They have been refurbished to modern standards, but one blew up in ground testing earlier this year." Analysis: Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent This new rocket was part of Nasa's effort to contract out "routine" cargo resupply to the International Space Station. But if we needed reminding that nothing in space is routine then this explosion has brought that message home in spectacular fashion. The US space agency "seeded" development of Antares - and the supply ship it launches, Cygnus - by giving incentive payments to manufacturer Orbital Sciences Corporation, to help them develop a low-cost, commercial follow-on to fill the cargo gap left by the retired space shuttles. The blast is likely to have seriously damaged the launch pad and support infrastructure, meaning that even if the fault is quickly identified and corrected, restarting Antares flights again may take a long time. However, there should be no immediate threat to supplies for astronauts on the space station. The Cygnus cargo ship that was on top of the Antares is one of a fleet of vehicles that are used in this role. These other robotic vessels, launched atop other rockets, will now have to pick up the slack. There is no doubting the explosion is a major setback for Orbital Sciences Corporation, and its plans to market Antares as a multi-purpose, commercial launcher. Confidence always takes a hit in the wake of a failure. But Orbital has the expertise to come back - as it has done after previous launch failures.
The final column of about 100 armoured vehicles carrying 500 soldiers crossed the southern Iraqi desert overnight. At the peak of the operation there were 170,000 US troops and more than 500 bases in Iraq. Nearly 4,500 US soldiers and tens of thousands of Iraqis have died since the US-led campaign began in 2003. The operation has cost Washington nearly $1 trillion (£643bn). US forces ended combat missions in Iraq in 2010 and had already handed over much of their security role. "(It's) a good feeling... knowing this is going to be the last mission out of here," said Private First Class Martin Lamb, part of the final "tactical road march" out of Iraq. "Part of history, you know - we're the last ones out." As the last of the armoured vehicles crossed the border, a gate was closed behind them and US and Kuwaiti soldiers gathered there to shake hands and pose for pictures. The only US military presence left in Iraq now is 157 soldiers responsible for training at the US embassy, as well as a small contingent of marines protecting the diplomatic mission. The low-key US exit was in stark contact to the blaze of aerial bombardment Washington unleashed against Saddam Hussein in 2003. Tribute US President Barack Obama marked the end of the war earlier in the week, meeting Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. He announced in October that all US troops would leave Iraq by the end of 2011, a date previously agreed by former President George W Bush in 2008. In a recent speech at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, President Obama paid tribute to the soldiers who had served in Iraq. He acknowledged that the war had been controversial, but told returning troops they were leaving behind "a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq". However, correspondents say there are concerns in Washington that Iraq lacks robust political structures or an ability to defend its borders. There are also fears that Iraq could be plunged back into sectarian bloodletting, or be unduly influenced by Iran. Washington had wanted to keep a small training and counter-terrorism presence in Iraq, but US officials were unable to strike a deal with Baghdad on legal issues including immunity for troops.
The Office for National Statistics said the change was driven by "a statistically significant" increase of 40,000 people leaving the country. These were mostly EU citizens - 117,000 emigrated, up 31,000 from 2015. Net migration is the difference between people coming to the UK for more than a year, and the number of people leaving the UK for a year or more. The ONS report for 2016 includes six months of data following the EU referendum. Its figures for the year estimated immigration at 588,000, with emigration of 339,000. The difference between the two gives the total for net migration. In 2016, the total number of people moving to the UK was made up of 264,000 non-EU citizens, 250,000 EU citizens and 74,000 British citizens. The ONS figures are the last official migration data before next month's general election. The Conservatives' aim since 2010 has been to reduce net migration to "the tens of thousands". In its election manifesto, Labour said it was offering "fair rules and reasonable management of migration" - but dismissed targets as "bogus". Amber Rudd, the Home Secretary, said: "It's good that the overall figure has come down now by nearly a quarter in a year. "We're determined to make sure that we do continue to reduce the overall net migration number." The new figures give the fullest picture yet of immigration around the EU referendum vote last year. Britain's settlement following departure from the bloc is expected to include restrictions on free movement rules, although the precise arrangements for post-Brexit immigration are yet to be thrashed out. Immigration from EU8 states - the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia - was down by 25,000 to 48,000, while those leaving the country increased by 16,000 in 2015, to 43,000 last year. These resulted in the smallest net migration estimate of 5,000 for this group of nations since they joined the EU in 2004. For the overall figures, the last time net migration was below 250,000 was in the year to March 2014. Work remains the most common reason for international migration, with 275,000 people coming into the UK for work in 2016 - down 33,000 from 2015. The majority - 180,000 - had a definite job, similar to 2015, but fewer people came into the UK looking for work - 95,000, down 35,000 from 2015. In 2016, more people left the UK with a definite job - 116,000 - than in 2015. A total of 9,634 people were granted asylum or an alternative form of protection in the year ending March 2017. In addition, 5,453 people were granted humanitarian protection under the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme over the same period.
By Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese Service, Washington As anti-racism protests sweep across the US, Beijing has seized upon them to hit back at Washington for supporting last year's Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrations. Chinese state media have given extensive coverage to the protests, highlighting the chaotic scenes and alleged police brutality in America to claim that China enjoys greater social stability. Speaking to an international audience, Chinese diplomats are attempting to portray Beijing as a responsible global leader, standing in solidarity with other countries in condemning the racial disparity and injustice in the US. 'A beautiful sight' China's state news agency Xinhua described the US civil unrest as "Pelosi's beautiful landscape" - a reference to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comment last summer that the Hong Kong protests were "a beautiful sight to behold". State media Global Times' chief editor Hu Xijin wrote that American politicians now can "enjoy this sight from their own windows". Beijing has long condemned American politicians, including Ms Pelosi, for "glorifying violence" coming from the Hong Kong demonstrators, who are categorised by China as "rioters showing signs of terrorism". Protests paralysed Hong Kong for most of last year, prompting Beijing to impose a new national security law in the territory in May, only two weeks ahead of the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Aynne Kokas, senior faculty fellow with the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs, says that both the US and China are contending with a high level of domestic instability triggered by the global coronavirus pandemic and political events. "Now is a key moment through which China is able to leverage the lack of stability in the US, in order to more efficiently promote its own national security goals," she says. Criticism over US applying 'double standard' Chinese and Hong Kong officials have also called out the US for applying "double standards" in its response to civil unrest. "You know there are riots in the United States and we see how local governments reacted," said Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam. "And then in Hong Kong, when we had similar riots, we saw what position they adopted then." The officials' view is shared by many Chinese social media users, who dub America "the double standard nation". Allegations of excessive use of police force during the US protests have been put under the spotlight by Chinese state media, to delegitimise Washington's position on upholding freedom and democracy. In one example, state broadcaster China Central Television reported on American journalists being pepper sprayed and a freelance photographer partially blinded by a rubber bullet while covering the protests. More from Zhaoyin Georgia State University Global Communication Assistant Professor Maria Repnikova says that the scale and intensity of Chinese state media coverage on the US protests is unprecedented. "It's powerful, because they are not making it up," Prof Repnikova says, but she points out that Chinese state media have cherry-picked the more peaceful pictures of Hong Kong police and the most violent ones from the US. China itself has been heavily criticised for cracking down on press freedom, which is rarely mentioned by the government and state media. On Weibo, many see America's freedoms and democracy as at risk, as police fired tear gas at peaceful protesters and military was deployed to quell the protests. Ms Kokas says: "Chinese state media don't have to craft a narrative, they can just talk about the objective events that have happen in Washington DC, that undermines the very principle of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly." The US's rhetoric about the democratic rights of Hong Kong now seems "very hollow"，she adds, "when military helicopters are flying over [Washington] DC". Chinese diplomats condemn US racism The increasingly outspoken Chinese diplomats have seized the chance to spotlight the US's governing failure and promote Beijing as a more responsible global leader. Ms Kokas describes this as a continuation of the country's propaganda strategy on the Covid-19 pandemic - when America fails, China is here to help. Chinese diplomats on Twitter retweeted messages of UN and African Union officials, condemning racial discrimination and police brutality in the US. The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying tweeted "I can't breathe", with a screencap of the US state department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus' previous criticism over Beijing's handling in Hong Kong. But another of Hua's messages denouncing anti-black racism backfired on Twitter, as she included "all lives matter", a phrase often used to undermine the "black lives matter" movement. Meanwhile, there are reports that African residents in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou have been discriminated against and forced into quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing has not officially apologised for any mishandling, only stating that there were some "misunderstandings". One Weibo user expresses "disappointment", as the person sees "some Chinese criticise others for racial discrimination, but when it comes to their own anti-black racism, they take it for granted". China is also accused of detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in high-security prison camps in its far western Xinjiang region. Anti-America sentiment on the rise There's no doubt US protests have sparked heated discussion on Weibo - the topic is one of the most popular on the site this week. Related posts have earned more than 25 billion views. Many Weibo posts "congratulate" the US for the civil unrest and push back at its support for the Hong Kong demonstrations. One user writes: "The US government has been inflaming violence around the world, now the American people have finally woken up. The US government deserves this!" And Beijing and its state media spread the theory that Washington was fomenting the protests in Hong Kong, calling it a "black hand" behind the unrest. As US-China relations have soured due to the Hong Kong protests, trade conflicts and the pandemic, anti-America sentiment appears to be on the rise in China. Thousands of Weibo comments describe the US protests as "karma" for Washington. But some Chinese seem genuinely saddened by the situation. "This is trampling on human rights! Democracy in the US came to an end at this exact moment," a Weibo user commented under a video showing the CNN reporter getting arrested, receiving thousands of likes. Many on Weibo also voice support for the civil rights movement. "Nothing much has changed after generations of fights. I hope this time will yield better results," a comment reads. Some Chinese also reflect on the weaknesses of their country. One Weibo user writes about being "envious of the freedom of expression" in the US, as anti-government protests are often forcefully cracked down in China. Some posts urge the state media to cover China's domestic police violence and injustice with the same level of dedication. But liberal voices are often met with harsh criticism. State-affiliated yet liberal leaning newspaper Beijing News published a commentary advocating for empathy and respect for the American people, but it was quickly slammed as taking a "pro-America" stance and received tens of thousands of negative comments on Weibo. Social media has always been an imperfect window to observe China's public opinion. Its echo chamber effect is exacerbated by the country's information censorship. Prof Repnikova says that the relatively liberal views may become even more marginalised on Chinese social media, as cyber nationalism, a combination of bottom-up sentiments and top-down propaganda tactic, is increasingly dominant on the sites. "The more aggressive, nationalistic and vocal voices are taking over the space," she says. Additional reporting by Yitsing Wang
Mr Osborne will loosen regulation to allow the move. Under an £8bn pilot scheme, London-based investors will be able to apply for a licence to use the Chinese currency to invest directly in Chinese shares and bonds. Until now, they have had to direct their investments via Hong Kong. Mr Osborne is also facilitating talks between Chinese banks and the UK banks regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, to allow them to establish branches for wholesale activities in London. This would allow China's huge banks to conduct business in London with companies and financial institutions, but not to offer High Street services. London is already the main overseas location for trading China's currency, known as the yuan or renminbi (RMB), with $5.3tn worth traded on an average day. But strict rules on transparency and cash reserve requirements have forced China to base its three biggest banks in Luxembourg. 'Jobs for Britain' Setting up the bank branches is good for China, as they would be able to operate under Chinese regulations. Mr Osborne said: "A great nation like China should have a great global currency." "Today we agreed the next big step in making London - already the global centre for finance - a major global centre for trading and now investing the Chinese currency, too." He said the move would mean more trade, investment, business and jobs for Britain. Discussions will begin between the Prudential Regulation Authority and Chinese banks in London. The announcement is part of the chancellor's visit to China this week. A joint statement from the two countries said both sides "welcomed this as an important step that cements London's major role as one of the most important global centres for RMB trading". On Monday, the chancellor announced a simplified application process for Chinese tourists wanting to visit the UK while in Europe.
Intel applied for a licence to export tens of thousands of chips to update the Tianhe-2 computer. The Department of Commerce refused, saying it was concerned about nuclear research being done with the machine. Separately, Intel has signed a $200m (£136m) deal with the US government to build a massive supercomputer at one of its national laboratories. The Tianhe-2 uses 80,000 Intel Xeon chips to generate a computational capacity of more than 33 petaflops. A petaflop is equal to about one quadrillion calculations per second. According to the Top 500, an organisation that monitors supercomputers, the Tianhe-2 has been the world's most powerful machine for the past 18 months. This year the Chinese machine was due to undergo a series of upgrades to boost its number-crunching abilities past 110 petaflops. The upgrades would depend largely on new Intel Xeon chips. The chipmaker informed US authorities of its involvement with the upgrade programme and was told to apply for an export licence. 'In compliance' In a notice published online the US Department of Commerce said it refused Intel's application to export the chips for Tianhe-2 and three other Chinese supercomputers because the machines were being used for "nuclear explosive activities". The relevant section of US export regulations reveals that this covers technologies used in the "design, development or fabrication" of nuclear weapons. The notice added that the four institutions where the supercomputers would be located were deemed to be "acting contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States". In a statement given to the IDG news wire, the chipmaker said: "Intel complied with the notification and applied for the licence, which was denied. We are in compliance with the US law." China is now believed to be accelerating its own home-grown chipmaking efforts to boost the power of the four supercomputers and complete the upgrade programme. Although Intel has been denied the chance to sell its Xeon chips to China, the company has signed a large deal to build the Aurora supercomputer at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. When finished that machine is expected to have a peak performance of 180 petaflops.
The two-year-old will go to the Westacre Montessori School Nursery in Norfolk from January. A nursery spokesman said: "We are looking forward to welcoming George to our nursery." The nursery, near King's Lynn, is close to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's home, Anmer Hall. The BBC's royal correspondent Peter Hunt said the duke and duchess appreciate what they see as the care being shown by the British media around the privacy of their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, and are grateful for the public's support in respecting the privacy of their young family. He said the couple would be pleased George's new nursery was sited in a private road, not a public one. The nursery said Prince George would "get the same special experience as all of our children". Read more on this and other news from across Norfolk Analysis by Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent Prince George is continuing a royal tradition but not one that is long established. The Queen was educated at home and relied on her nanny, Crawfie, to take her on educational trips - including a journey on the London Tube. Prince Charles did go to school but his nursery was a palace room containing a blackboard, a desk and a governess. It was at his mother's insistence that Prince William was exposed to children of his own age when he started at Mrs Mynors' School. Read more from Peter Hunt The new picture shows the duke and duchess with their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte in the garden at Kensington Palace. It was taken in late October by photographer Chris Jelf. Mr Jelf said: "I thoroughly enjoyed photographing a very lovely family, although you have to be sharp as you don't have long when there are two young children involved! "I hope everyone enjoys this photo and I am honoured that the duke and duchess have decided to share it with the public." Kensington Palace said that the royal couple were "very much looking forward to their first Christmas as a family of four" and "hugely appreciative of all the warm messages they have received about their family this year". The early learning at the Westacre Montessori School was rated good by Ofsted after an inspection in June 2015. It costs £5.50 an hour or £33 a day to attend the nursery. The school follows the principles of an Italian doctor called Maria Montessori who developed a new approach to teaching in the early 20th Century, in which children take responsibility for their own learning. Analysis: What goes on in a Montessori nursery? The Montessori teaching method was developed by Italy's first female professor in the slums of Rome in the early 1900s. Working with special needs children, Dr Maria Montessori developed a child-centred approach using the classroom as her laboratory. Utilising children's natural instinct to learn through play, children are free to develop at their own pace. They choose the activities they want to pursue, in effect being trusted as the masters of their own development. Much Montessori philosophy has been incorporated as best practice in regular nurseries. Staff may lead activities, such as identifying sand paper numbers, which children will be encouraged but not obliged to take part in. Montessori nurseries can be quite different however, with some following the principles more closely than others. To use the name, a nursery must have a Montessori-trained member of staff. Prince William was the first senior royal to go to nursery and not start his education in a palace.

The news has prompted headlines around the world, and Politicians and city leaders have taken to Twitter to congratulate him, including the left-leaning mayors of New York and Paris. Congratulations also came from Ahok Basuki Purnama, the governor of Jakarta. He became Jakarta's first Christian governor in 50 years when he was elected in 2014. Jemima Goldsmith, the sister of Conservative party rival Zac Goldsmith, congratulated Mr Khan on his victory. The ex-wife of Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan also appeared to criticise her brother's campaign. 'Role model' for millions The New York Times describes Mr Khan's victory as "striking" and leads with the fact that he is London's first Muslim mayor. It described London as a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network. A commentary in German news magazine Der Spiegel describes Mr Khan's win as a "victory over Islamophobia", and says London is breaking new ground. "The mayoral election shows that London is more liberal, clever and tolerant than the Conservative mudslingers would like to think," it says. Qatari daily Al-Sharq says: "Once again, the British capital enters history, this time through the gate of democratic victory by electing a Muslim of immigrant descent as its mayor." Pakistan's Dawn newspaper says that Khan should see himself as a role model for millions of Muslims living in Europe. With the rise of increasingly popular right-wing parties across the continent, the paper's Brussels correspondent Shada Islam writes that "Khan's story should help set the record straight on immigration, integration and European Muslims". History Professor Juan Cole points out that Mr Khan is by no means the first Muslim in charge of a European city. In a popular blog post he traces the history of Muslim rule in Spain, Greece, the Balkans, and Sicily. "Not to mention that Constantinople/Istanbul is one of the larger European cities... the mayor there is a Muslim," he says. Bus drivers 'new elite'? Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, former co-chair of the UK Conservative Party, and Business Secretary Sajid Javid congratulated Mr Khan and pointed out their similar backgrounds. "Bus drivers are clearly the new Etonians" quipped writer and conservative activist Tim Montgomerie, referring to the elite public school attended by Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Goldsmith. In France's Le Figaro, London-based French essayist Laetitia Strauch-Bonnart says "two images of the United Kingdom" faced each other in this election: The "exemplary success story" of Mr Khan's life and "the billionaire's son", Mr Goldsmith. "In order to appeal nowadays, it is better to have a disadvantaged background, a personal history made of difficulties and social mobility," she told the paper. "It's the spirit of the time, and Goldsmith was not on the right side." Finally, before the result was in, former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted a warning about how Mr Khan could possibly be treated if Republican hopeful Donald Trump was to become US President.
By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent The driving force behind this is 32-year-old Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, who also heads the newly formed anti-corruption committee. So what's this all about? Is it really about corruption or is it nothing more than a power grab by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? The answer is it's both. Corruption is rampant in Saudi Arabia. Bribes, sweeteners and lavish kickbacks have long been an integral part of doing business in the world's richest oil-producing nation. Many of those appointed to key positions amassed astronomical wealth - in some cases running into billions of dollars - far beyond their government salaries, much of it stashed away in offshore accounts. The country can't afford this. It has a young, fast-growing population and it needs to find meaningful jobs for them and fund projects that will employ them. The crown prince - backed by his father, the 81-year-old King Salman - is going after some of the richest men in Arabia for several reasons. He wants to send a signal that the old way of doing business is no longer acceptable, that Saudi Arabia needs to reform and modernise if it is to survive as a successful nation in the 21st Century. The government he leads would love to get its hands on some of these offshore private assets, estimated by some to total as much as $800bn (£610bn). But where does it end? The attorney general has already announced that "phase one" of the purge is complete, implying there are more arrests to come. The ruling Al Saud family has never revealed how much of the nation's oil wealth goes to which princes and their families, and there are thousands of them. In 2015, the crown prince reportedly bought himself a yacht from a Russian businessman for 500m euros ($580m; £440m). So while many ordinary Saudis are welcoming this purge of the rich and famous, in the hopes that some of their wealth will be redistributed to the general population, it is not yet clear where the line will be drawn on this investigation. This is of course, about power too. At 32 years old, Prince Mohammed bin Salman - or MBS, as he is known - has already amassed extraordinary control over the key levers in the country. He is the youngest defence minister of any major country, and is also driving an economic development programme, declaring his intention to wean Saudi Arabia off its dependence on oil revenues. As his father's favoured son, he runs the all-powerful Royal Court, and he has some useful allies. After a visit to Washington and President Donald Trump's trip to Riyadh in May, there is now a close bond between the crown prince and the White House. He is largely popular with the young, despite dragging the country into a seemingly unwinnable war in Yemen and executing a damaging boycott against neighbouring Qatar. But he also has enemies. The old guard in Saudi Arabia are rattled. For a start, the elevation of such a young, untested prince to be next in line to the throne has upset the usual line of succession. Part of last Saturday's purge included the removal of Prince Miteb bin Abdullah as head of the National Guard. Prince Miteb was never a credible threat to the crown prince, but the National Guard has been run by former King Abdullah and then his son for 51 years. A whole network of patronage and tribal alliances has now been thrown into doubt. The crown prince knows that to drive through his modernising reform programme he may meet resistance, but he is now demonstrating a steely ruthlessness in removing anyone or anything that could get in his way. There is no-one left in Saudi Arabia with any obvious powerbase to challenge the rise to power of the crown prince and he could well become king and rule for the next half-century. Some among the royal family are grumbling that he is taking on too much too quickly, but perhaps more worrying is how the religious conservatives will react in the long-term. The Al Saud depend on these clerics for their legitimacy to rule the home of the two holiest places in Islam, Mecca and Medina (the king carries the title "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques"). So far, the clerics have accepted the curbs on their power and in September acceded to the lifting of the ban on women driving, which they always resisted. But how will they react when cinemas and other Western-style forms of entertainment are introduced as planned? How will the huge and well-connected Saudi business community react to the anti-corruption purge? Will international capital flow in or out? Most importantly, can the crown prince deliver on his promise of jobs for the nation's youth? In time, history will decide whether the purge begun on Saturday night has set the course for a better, cleaner Saudi Arabia, or whether it has started to melt the glue that holds this complex country together.
By Navin Singh KhadkaEnvironment correspondent, BBC World Service Base camp officials said they had received reports of 17 confirmed cases from hospitals in the capital Kathmandu, where a number of climbers have been sent from the base camp and higher camps to be treated. And staff at a private hospital in Kathmandu, the CIWEC clinic, confirmed to the BBC that patients had tested positive for coronavirus after arriving from Everest base camp. The Nepalese government has so far denied having any knowledge of positive cases at Everest base camp, raising concerns that officials are downplaying the extent of the situation out of fear it will bring more pressure to close the mountain to expeditions. Foreign climbers are a major source of revenue for the Nepalese government, which shut Everest last year during the pandemic. Authorities are mandating that visiting climbers quarantine in Nepal before proceeding to base camp, but concerns have been raised within the climbing community that a serious outbreak at the mountain would be devastating. The number of coronavirus cases has risen sharply in Nepal in recent weeks, and the country has the highest rate of infection among the countries neighbouring India, where a second wave has sparked a full-blown crisis. Officials from Nepal's Department of Tourism, which directly oversees expeditions, could not be reached for comment, but Prem Subedi, the under-secretary at Nepal's Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, told the BBC the ministry was not aware of any coronavirus cases at base camp. "None of the Covid cases at Everest base camp have been reported so far to the Ministry of Tourism," he said. 'Confirmed cases' The Himalayan Rescue Association, which runs a government-authorised medical clinic at the base camp, told the BBC it had received confirmation of positive cases in some climbers flown out to Kathmandu by expedition teams. "We have just received from Kathmandu confirmation of 17 positive cases [in climbers flown out of Everest]," said Lhakpa Nuru Sherpa, an official with the Himalayan Rescue Association. "We have now asked expedition teams to first let us know before they fly out their members [to Kathmandu] who fall ill so that we know what is going on," he said. Lhakpa Nuru Sherpa's colleague at the Everest base camp clinic, Dr Prakash Kharel, said the number of people showing coronavirus-like symptoms, such as a persistent cough and fever, was rising daily "Almost all climbers get a cough here, but we are seeing people with other symptoms, and we are making sure that they stay in isolation," Dr Kharel said. The CIWEC clinic in Kathmandu also confirmed to the BBC that it had seen Covid-positive climbers come to them as patients from Everest. "We did have patients come to us from the Everest region who tested positive at our hospital a couple of weeks back," said staff member Astha Pant. "We cannot share how many people or any other information at this time." One of the big expedition teams, who asked not to be named, told the BBC that some of their members had previously tested positive, but had now recovered. A Norwegian climber, Erlend Ness, told the BBC that he had tested positive for the virus three times in two different hospitals in Kathmandu last month. Ness was initially thought to be suffering from altitude sickness, but was diagnosed with coronavirus after being airlifted from base camp. Climbers have raised fears that coronavirus symptoms would be mistaken for the similar effects of being at altitude. "You can hear people coughing everywhere," Lukas Furtenbach, team leader of Furtenbach Adventures, told the BBC from base camp. "But this is not just the regular cough that mountaineers catch here. You can make it out that people are in pain and they have other symptoms like fever and body aches." According to the website of the Department of Tourism, the government had issued 394 Everest climbing permits for this climbing season, as of 26 April. That would allow more than 1,500 people to be on the mountain, the majority of them support staff. Officials at Everest base camp said there was also concern over climbers coming back from Kathmandu either after Covid treatment or after acclimatisation rotation to adjust to the altitude. "They may have recovered themselves but they might bring the virus along with them as things are getting serious in Kathmandu," said the army official. "We have therefore recommended that climbers do the rotation acclimatisation at places below the base camp, instead of going to Kathmandu." No Covid testing facility Mountaineers and officials at the Everest base camp also said that the lack of a coronavirus testing facility at the base camp health clinic was a major handicap. "We had requested a testing facility but the government said they could not give the permission," said Dr Kharel. Some of the big expedition teams have said they have brought their own testing kits to Everest base camp, which has helped them to take timely steps like isolating people and evacuating them. Himalayan Rescue Association officials said they had only recently received the confirmed reports of 17 positive coronavirus cases in climbers from Everest base camp. "It is unfortunate that we have not been receiving the details of the confirmed cases and the identities of the climbers all this time," an army official at the base camp told the BBC. "That would have helped us in contact tracing and containing the spread much earlier," he said. "We could have then isolated the climbers who had come in contact with those who tested positive much earlier." You may also be interested in:
Author JK Rowling announced the series will also be available as audiobooks through a new website, Pottermore. The interactive website will also feature new material which Rowling says she has been "hoarding for years". "This is such a great way to give something back to the fans who made Harry Potter such a huge success," the author said. The Harry Potter novels have sold more than 450 million copies through Bloomsbury in Britain, and Scholastic in the United States. However the e-books - which will be available in several languages - will be published through Rowling's Pottermore Publishing, rather than her print publishers which do not own the digital rights. 'New stuff' Pottermore will go live on 31 July - Harry Potter's birthday. Rowling told the BBC that the new material was being released online, rather than in a new book, because she did not have "a new story". "Most of this writing is material I generated while I was writing the books initially," she said. "It's background, and lots of details that didn't make it into the book. "Some of it is new stuff in response to things fans have asked me over the years." The site, which Rowling said she had been working on for two years, promises to immerse users in the boy wizard's world, offering opportunities for computer gaming, social networking and an online store. Sections let users shop for wands in Diagon Alley, travel to Hogwarts from the imaginary platform at London's King's Cross train station and be sorted into Hogwarts' school houses using the Sorting Hat. One million users will initially be chosen to help develop the online world, before it is open to all users from October. Rowling told reporters at the London Pottermore launch she had no intention of writing an eighth Harry Potter book. "I do have closure with Harry. I'm pretty sure I'm done on the novel front, but it was fun while it lasted," she said.
By Eleanor LawrieTechnology of Business reporter A bit steep, you might think, for a picture of someone you've never heard of. And you won't have heard of the artist either, as the picture was created by an algorithm drawing on a data set of 15,000 portraits painted between the 14th and 20th Centuries. And to be honest, it's a bit rubbish. The sale, which astonished auction house Christie's, raised many important questions. Can a computer, devoid of human emotion, ever be truly creative? Is this portrait really art? Does any of that matter if people are prepared to pay for it? And as artificial intelligence evolves and eventually perhaps reaches or surpasses human level intelligence, what will this mean for human artists and the creative industries in general? Algorithms have already created artworks, poems, and pieces of music, but are they merely mimicking rather than creating? Cognitive neuroscientist Romy Lorenz says a lot depends on how we define creativity. If creativity means finding completely new ways to solve problems, then AI has already achieved that, she argues, citing Google's DeepMind subsidiary. In 2017, one of DeepMind's AI programmes beat the world's number one player of Go, an ancient and highly complex Chinese board game, after apparently mastering creative new moves and innovative strategies within days. "Google would say that was creativity - new ways of finding solutions that it was not taught," she says. But is art more than just creative problem-solving? More Technology of Business Games, particularly those which take place within virtual worlds, have been the perfect setting for AI to solve problems creatively. But asking an algorithm to create without any human input at all actually yields quite boring results, argues New York-based professor of computer science, Julian Togelius. He cites Kate Compton's "10,000 bowls of oatmeal" problem, which suggests that while algorithms can now create infinite worlds, these can be tedious for humans to play in. An example, he suggests, was the hotly-anticipated release of space exploration game No Man's Sky, which offered 18 quintillion algorithmically-generated planets to explore. "In No Man's Sky there are more places you could visit in a lifetime, with different flora and fauna. But that game has had mixed reviews - it's a technical masterpiece but it's not super interesting to play," he says. "The question is, can your algorithm generate a world that has meaning to it, and that is particular to the player in terms of place or skill? "These algorithms are amazing - they can do more and more. But there will always be things us humans want to put in. It's the power of the sensibility and intentionality of the human brain - that's what is hard [to recreate]." Dr Lorenz points out that true artistic creativity differs from creative problem solving in that it requires a shift in perspective that machines do not appear to have the capacity for. "Artistic creativity is about turning an introspective thought into a medium, whether it's a sculpture or a piece of music. It's about taking an abstract form and making it concrete. "But AI has no internal world and it has no need to create its desires or fears." So rather than letting AI take complete control, results seem to be far more fruitful when human artists work hand-in-hand with machines. Musician and University of Sussex lecturer Dr Alice Eldridge suggests that we should treat AI as "just another tool that we have designed, like the wheel, or the combustion engine". She has helped create a cello that uses a combination of acoustics, electrification and an adaptive algorithm that makes the instrument self-resonate; or essentially, play itself. "With a classical cello you have to bring the instrument alive with a bow; a feedback cello is already singing, your job as a performer is to shape the sound - it's more like a dance than 'controlling' an instrument in the traditional way," she says. "This creates a different way of thinking about, and designing our relationships with, musical instruments, and technology in general." Mick Grierson, at the UAL Creative Computing Institute in London, believes advances in AI will "lead to better art, new types of artists and new mediums". In 2016, Nordic band Sigur Rós used his software to create a constantly evolving version of one of their singles, which the band played on a 24-hour road trip around Iceland. Individual musical elements of the song were fed through the software to make a song that, like a live performance, is subtly different with every repetition, and could respond to external prompts. Innovative composer and producer Brian Eno, who has worked with Roxy Music, David Bowie and Coldplay amongst others, is also a big fan of using algorithms to create music that constantly changes. Prof Grierson has also worked with Massive Attack on an AI reworking of their Mezzanine album, to mark its 20th anniversary. The album will be fed into a form of AI that teaches itself - a neural network - and visitors to an upcoming Barbican exhibition will be able to affect the resulting sound by their movements. While AI could be seen as yet another threat to artists' livelihoods, he believes machines will never come close to competing. "AI could be used to reduce human creativity by people who want to make money - but it's people [not technology] who are responsible for doing that. "The technology is never going to be good enough to generate better culture than people who use it to create their own." Follow Technology of Business editor Matthew Wall on Twitter and Facebooko
The surprise announcement about his long-time consort comes before his elaborate coronation ceremonies begin on Saturday. King Maha Vajiralongkorn, 66, became the constitutional monarch after the death of his much-loved father in 2016. He has been married and divorced three times before and has seven children. A royal statement said: King Vajiralongkorn "has decided to promote General Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya, his royal consort, to become Queen Suthida and she will hold royal title and status as part of the royal family". Queen Suthida is King Vajiralongkorn's long-term partner and has been seen with him in public for many years, though their relationship has never before been officially acknowledged. Footage from the wedding ceremony was shown on Thai TV channels late Wednesday, showing other members of the royal family and palace advisers in attendance. The king is seen pouring sacred water on the head of Queen Suthida. The couple then sign a marriage registry. She and others are prostrated before the monarch, as is customary in Thailand. In 2014 Vajiralongkorn appointed Suthida Tidjai, a former flight attendant for Thai Airways, as the deputy commander of his bodyguard unit. He made her a full general in the army in December 2016. The previous king, Bhumibol Adulyadej, ruled for 70 years, making him the longest-reigning monarch in the world when he died in 2016.
On Sunday, he was picked by the opposition alliance as its prime ministerial candidate for a general election that must be called by August. Mr Mahathir stepped down as prime minister in 2003. He had served in the post for more than two decades. If he wins, he will become one of the world's oldest leaders. In recent years, he has been drawn back into politics because of his vocal opposition to current Prime Minister Najib Razak, who has been embroiled in a multi-billion dollar financial scandal involving a state development fund called 1MDB. Mr Mahathir cut links with the ruling UMNO party and in 2016 started a new party, Bersatu, which joined the Pakatan Harapan opposition alliance. The former leader's authoritarian but essentially pragmatic policies at home during his tenure helped transform Malaysia into an Asian economic tiger, correspondents say. However throughout his rule, he took a tough stand against those who opposed him or threatened his power, they add. His deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, was abruptly sacked in 1998 over political difference, and was then jailed for six years on sodomy and corruption charges. But the two former political enemies have put aside their differences to take on Najib Razak. Mr Ibrahim, who led the opposition in the 2013 elections, was again jailed in 2015 on charges he says are politically motivated. The opposition says that if it wins it will seek a royal pardon for him so he is eligible to be prime minister.
The power switch could short-circuit, causing parts to overheat and potentially leading to a fire, the company said. It is the latest in a string of recalls by the carmaker. Toyota has already recalled some 10 million cars globally that were fitted with faulty air bags linked to a number of deaths. Manufacturing glitch The defective window switch affects models including the Yaris model as well as the Corolla, Camry, RAV4, Highlander and others. The recall only affects cars produced between 2005 and 2010. Of the total, about 2.7 million cars were sold in North America, 1.2 million in Europe, and 600,000 in Japan, the company said. The firm explained that modules in a switch related to the electric window might have been lubricated inconsistently during manufacturing. Debris caused by wear from the electrical contact points can accumulate and cause a short-circuit. This could in turn cause the switch to overheat and melt, potentially leading to a fire. Toyota said it was not aware of any accidents caused by the glitch.
Sarah SmithScotland editor The debate was suspended and the vote delayed last Wednesday as news reached the chamber of the terror attack in Westminster. Today they will pick up where they left off. The result of the vote this evening is not in any doubt. With the support of the Scottish Greens, the SNP will win the vote calling for a second referendum. They will then claim that the prime minister must not stand in the way of the democratically expressed will of the Scottish Parliament. But the other opposition parties - the Tories, Labour and Lib Dems - all believe that the will of the parliament does not match the will of the people. Scottish voters don't want another referendum, they argue, and they are convinced public opinion is on their side. It used to be received wisdom in Scottish politics that if Westminster tried to deny a Scottish referendum it could easily backfire and stir up support for independence. But the unionist parties are confident there is no great public demand for another vote - other than among people who are already committed nationalists. Opinion polls suggest people are split fairly evenly, about 50/50, on whether they want another vote. And it tends to be Yes supporters who say yes to another referendum and No voters who say no, not now. The great divide in Scottish politics over the question of independence may only be solidified by this current debate over whether to re-run the 2014 referendum. Nicola Sturgeon will argue that this is now a great constitutional struggle in which the Scottish Parliament is battling with Westminster. Tories say Ms Sturgeon is just playing a well rehearsed game, one in which she puts forward a proposal she knows will be rejected by Westminster and then responds with righteous indignation. And we are about to see that happen once again. The first minster will soon send a letter to 10 Downing Street demanding another referendum. No 10 will reply to say they are not prepared to talk about it at this time. The prime minister made that clear when she met Nicola Sturgeon in Glasgow yesterday, when she said it was more important to pull together and get the best Brexit deal for the whole of the UK. The big question, the big calculation for both sides, is how many Scottish voters will then share the SNP's inevitable outrage about being denied another referendum. Some will. Others will breathe a huge sigh of relief that they don't have to live through another campaign. At least not yet.
By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It is 6.1mm (0.24in) thick, and also gains a Touch ID fingerprint sensor. It has an anti-reflective coating on the screen for the first time, and the A8X - a faster version of the processor featured in the firm's latest iPhones. However, some analysts have questioned whether the upgrade will be enough to turn around iPad sales. An upgraded version of the firm's smaller tablet - called the iPad Mini 3 - was also announced. Like its bigger sibling, it gets the company's fingerprint recognition component. But it uses the older A7 processor and has a lower-resolution rear camera. Some of the details were published by Apple, reportedly by mistake, on Wednesday. Apple's last earnings release revealed that it had sold 13.3 million iPads in the April-to-June quarter. That marked a 9% fall on its tally for the same period in 2013, despite the fact the company saw sales of iPhones and Mac computers rise. It also contrasted with an 11% rise in the number of tablet shipments across the market as a whole - with Lenovo and Asus making some of the biggest gains - according to data from IDC. The market research firm said that the iPad remained the bestselling tablet brand, but that its market share had dropped over the year from 33% to 26.9%. Cannibalised sales? One expert suggested that the recent launch of the 5.5in (14cm)-screened iPhone 6 Plus, which shares most of the new iPads' features, could further temper demand. "Given that Apple's launched larger iPhones, it needs to find a market that the iPad Mini fits into," said Jitesh Ubrani from IDC. "It was a response to the market as a whole moving to smaller tablets. And now that phablets are growing in not just screen size but also in market size, unless Apple carves out a special place for it, we expect sales of the Mini in particular to be cannibalised quite a bit." Apple's chief executive Tim Cook has told investors he still believes that the tablet market will eventually surpass that of PCs, and has pointed to a recent deal with IBM - involving the two firms co-developing business-centric apps - as a way to get iPad sales on "a faster trajectory". Mr Ubrani agreed that targeting businesses had huge potential, but warned that sales to consumers would remain a challenge. "People who have the old iPad 2 or more recent versions are still happy with these devices - they are still functioning perfectly fine," he said. "There's really no reason to upgrade." Other new features of the iPad Air 2 include an eight megapixel rear camera that can now capture slow-mo videos at 120 frames per second. The front camera has also been upgraded to allow in more light and take a rapid succession of selfies. In addition, the machine includes a new type of wi-fi chip that supports faster data speeds, including downloads at up to 866 megabits per second (Mbps). "It is disappointing - particularly to enterprise buyers - that there wasn't a 12.9in [32.8cm] iPad model," said JP Gownder from research firm Forrester, who otherwise praised the update. "In order to return iPad to high growth, form factor innovation will be required." The new tablets will become available to buy next week at similar prices to before. New iMacs Apple also introduced a new model of its all-in-one iMac computer featuring what it said was the highest resolution display on the market. The computer has a 27in (68.6cm) screen that has a resolution of 5K - 5210 by 2880 pixels - offering about five times the detail of a "full HD" 1080p television. That represents four times the number of pixels found in the standard iMac of the same size. The basic model will cost $2,499 (£1,555) and is already available for sale. Lenovo already sells the N308 - an all-in-one Android-powered desktop PC with a 19.5in (49.5cm) screen offering slightly lower 4K resolution, while Panasonic has the Toughpad MB5025 - a 20in (50.8cm) 4K computer that runs Windows 8. Intel and Samsung have also announced plans to manufacture 4K screens for other all-in-one PCs. Otherwise, large ultra-high definition display are still a rarity in the computing sector beyond the use of separate monitors, which may aid demand for the new computer. "There is a huge difference in quality once you start moving through the different sets of screens," remarked Ranjit Atwal, research director at the tech consultancy Gartner. "Given the amount of consumption people are doing of online video, and the quality of what they can get from services like YouTube and Netflix on 4K TVs, they want to see that replicated on a PC as well." Apple suggested that people doing visual productivity tasks, such as photo editing, would also benefit from the innovation. Apple also announced an upgraded version of its screenless computer, the Mac Mini, but there was no mention of an update to its Apple TV set top box, which last received a hardware refresh in March 2012. The company also said that the latest version of its operating system for Mac computers - OS X Yosemite - was being made available for download this Thursday. The software allows data to be swapped back and forth with iOS-powered iPhones and iPads more easily than before. Its user interface has also been designed with higher resolution screens in mind. The company added that version 8.1 of iOS, which introduces support for its near field communication (NFC)-powered payment service Apple Pay, would be released on Monday.
Shelling killed five people in rebel-held Donetsk city on Wednesday while 19 Ukrainian soldiers died on Tuesday. The talks in the Belarusian capital Minsk are set to focus on securing a ceasefire, withdrawal of heavy weapons and creating a demilitarised zone. Berlin and Paris have been working hard on a deal for the past week. French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were due to meet Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko before full talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking after his arrival, Mr Poroshenko said the situation threatened to spin "out of control" if the parties did not agree to de-escalation and a ceasefire. While the Ukrainian government is seeking a demarcation line based on the failed ceasefire agreed on 5 September in Belarus last year, the rebels want a new truce to reflect the gains they have made in recent weeks, the BBC's James Reynolds reports from Donetsk. More than 5,400 people have died since the conflict began, and there has been a dramatic rise in casualties in recent days, with 263 civilians killed in populated areas between 31 January and 5 February. Ceasefire hopes: James Reynolds, BBC News, Donetsk Donetsk may be the tidiest city-at-war in the world. In the centre of town, the streets are swept, the benches are clean, the bins are empty. From the city centre you can hear the regular, deep boom of artillery fire in the distance. "We want to live alone," insists one woman who puts down her shopping bags to talk. "Most people here don't want to be ruled by Ukraine and [President] Poroshenko," she concludes. "We're hoping for a resolution," says another man, "But it all depends on Ukraine." A mother, walking with her young son, says she's exasperated with both sides. "They need to shut all the leaders in a room," she suggests, "like they do when they choose a Pope. Lock them in. Don't let any of them out until they've reached an agreement." With both sides seeking territorial gains before a potential ceasefire, there are fears that the violence could undermine attempts to secure a long-term deal. The majority of Ukrainian military casualties were near Debaltseve, a major transport hub where thousands of soldiers are under rebel siege. The separatists say they have cut off the main supply road into the town from the west as they try to capture a tongue-shaped area that cuts into the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk. At least two people were killed and several more injured when a shell hit a bus station in rebel-controlled Donetsk early on Wednesday. Three more deaths were reported during the night, city officials said. Volunteer pro-government fighters have also seized territory this week, capturing villages from the rebels outside the government-held of Mariupol. Rival agendas at Ukraine talks Ukraine: Restore government authority over breakaway areas, though Donetsk and Luhansk regions could get greater self-rule; disarm rebel forces; withdrawal of Russian troops; restore Kiev's control over Ukraine-Russia border; full prisoner exchange. Pro-Russian rebels: Separation from rest of Ukraine and recognition of "people's republics" of Donetsk and Luhansk; no disarmament of separatist forces; amnesty for separatist leaders. Russia: Legal guarantees for rights of Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine; full autonomy for Donetsk and Luhansk in a federal system - not necessarily independence; no return of Crimea to Ukraine; withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from combat zone. EU and US: Restore Ukraine's territorial integrity; end Russian intervention in eastern Ukraine - withdrawal of all Russian troops and heavy weapons; effective monitoring of Russia-Ukraine border and demilitarised zone between the combatants; full democracy in Donetsk and Luhansk. September 2014 ceasefire: The 12-point plan Why has conflict returned to eastern Ukraine? Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko said Wednesday's summit was one of the final chances to bring about an unconditional ceasefire and withdrawal of heavy weapons. But he warned that his government was prepared to impose martial law throughout Ukraine if the conflict escalated further. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini told AFP news agency that if a deal was reached, the Minsk summit would be "a turning point for good or for bad". Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending troops and arms to support the rebels, but Russia denies this. US President Barack Obama has refused to rule out supplying "lethal defensive weapons" to Kiev if diplomacy fails, but Russia says that would worsen the crisis. Ukraine's war: The human cost Source: Figures from UN report, 6 February
The money will be released over two years, with the first instalment of $3.2bn available straight away. The IMF loan will also unlock further funds worth $15bn from other donors, including the World Bank, EU, Canada and Japan. Months of turmoil have taken their toll. Interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk warned that the economy would shrink by at least 3% this year - and by as much as 10% without international assistance. But the price of that help will come in the form of higher energy bills and wage freezes. So why is the Ukrainian economy in such bad shape? And what is being done to fix it? What is the state of Ukraine's economy? In a nutshell: heavily indebted. Ukraine's new government has said it needs $35bn (£21bn) to pay its bills over the next two years, which the new loans should mostly cover. It owes the Russian gas company Gazprom $1.9bn. The Ukrainian economy shrank 0.3% in 2013, the IMF estimates. And the months of street protests, when the barricades were up on the streets of the capital, Kiev, will also have had an effect. The new government has also accused ousted President Viktor Yanukovych and his government of stripping billions from state coffers. The currency, the hryvnia, lost nearly a fifth of its value in February alone. It now stands at 11 to the US dollar, down from eight in January. The economy is struggling to recover from a recession and has been shaken by capital flight, as worried investors move their money abroad. Efforts to prop up the hryvnia have also depleted foreign currency reserves. Ukraine's stormy economy has history The Ukraine currency blame game Ukrainian currency hits 10-year low What difference will international aid make? A few months ago, a $15bn rescue package from Russia looked likely. But that was before street protests led to the removal of President Viktor Yanukovych, Moscow's man. Now the IMF and other international donors are stumping up a total of $32.1bn, reducing the risk that Ukraine will default on its debts. But the loan is dependent on strict economic reforms, including raising taxes and energy prices. The government has already raised gas prices by 50% in an effort to secure the bailout. It has also agreed to freeze the minimum wage. And Ukraine has a chequered history with the IMF: it failed to keep to the terms of previous assistance packages in 2008 and 2010. What economic help for Ukraine? What kind of economy does Ukraine have? Ukraine has a history of corruption and mismanagement that goes back to Soviet times. Consider this: Ukraine's economy is smaller than it was in 1992, shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. At the time, Ukraine and Poland had similar-sized economies, but Poland's economy is now twice as big as Ukraine's. The IMF estimates that the Ukrainian economy shrank 0.3% last year after barely growing in 2012. Ukraine has a lot of coal mining, especially around the eastern city of Donetsk, as well as ageing heavy industry including shipbuilding, steel and arms. However, because many industries are so energy-inefficient, they are highly dependent on imports of Russian gas, which have been heavily subsidised. Farming is also important: Ukraine has more arable land than any other European country and is a major producer of grain and sunflower oil. Wheat prices have risen 20% on world markets, partly because of the fear of instability in Ukraine. And then there is the shadow economy: everything from cash-in-hand labour to corruption to illegal activities. A 2012 study by two Ukrainian academics reckons the shadow economy is equivalent to 44% of Ukraine's economic output. In 2013, Ukraine was ranked 144 out of 177 in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index. Business and politics are deeply intertwined: Ukraine's richest man, Rinat Akhmetov was until recently an MP and a supporter of ex-President Yanukovych. His companies have received an important share of state tenders. Ukraine's stormy economy has history UOligarchs are Ukraine's weakest link What is the new Ukrainian government doing? Before the latest household gas price rise, consumers paid only a quarter of the cost of imported gas. The price increase was one of the conditions demanded by the IMF, but it was an unpopular measure that President Yanukovych refused to take. As well as the minimum wage freeze, taxes will go up and 10% of civil servants will be made redundant. There are also plans to cut corruption and red tape. And the IMF wants the hryvnia to float more freely against the dollar. But the government faces a dilemma: if its reforms inflict too much pain, protesters could - having removed one government - take to the streets again. Just ask the Egyptians. What effect will the dispute with Russia have? The dispute with Russia has already cost Ukraine the Crimea region. It also means higher energy prices. In return for the lease of the naval base at Sevastopol for the Black Sea fleet, Russia agreed to subsidise energy exports to Ukraine. Now Crimea has been annexed by Russia and the Russian state-controlled producer Gazprom is ending Ukraine's one-third discount. However, the loss of Crimea at least takes it off the books of the government in Kiev, which was paying for about two-thirds of its budget. The government in Kiev says if Russia goes ahead with trade restrictions, those could lower economic growth by up to 1%. Meanwhile, thousands of Russian troops have been deployed to the areas near Ukraine's eastern border, raising tensions. Even if Russia decides not to invade, the prospect of further instability will not do the Ukrainian economy any good.
By Faranak Amidi Women's Affairs reporter Aliya Shagieva posted the photo on social media back in April with the caption: 'I will feed my child whenever and wherever he needs to be fed.' She took the post down after being accused of immoral behaviour, but in an exclusive interview with the BBC she said the row was a result of a culture which hyper-sexualised the female form. "This body I've been given is not vulgar. It is functional, its purpose is to fulfil the physiological needs of my baby, not to be sexualised," she told BBC Kyrgyz. It wasn't only some social media users who disapproved. Her parents, President Almazbek Atambayev and his wife Raisa, were also unhappy. "They really didn't like it. And it is understandable because the younger generation is less conservative than their parents," Ms Shagieva said, speaking at her home on the outskirts of the Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek. Ms Shagieva posts actively on social media, including her own artwork and carefully stylized portraits of herself and her husband and baby, often set against the backdrop of wide open landscapes. Breastfeeding is a recurring theme. "When I'm breastfeeding my child I feel like I'm giving him the best I can give. Taking care of my baby and attending to his needs is more important to me than what people say about me," Ms Shagieva said. Who is Aliya Shagieva? Gulnara Kasmambetova, BBC Kyrgyz I interviewed Aliya Shagieva in her flat in a prestigious quarter of Bishkek which she shares with her husband and child. Her drawings and pictures were on the walls and the couple offered fruit and herbal tea. Herbs were growing in pots on the window sills; the couple are vegetarian, a rarity in a traditionally meat-eating country. In the context of a post-Soviet traditional Muslim society, Aliya Shagieva is very bold and very different. She was quite open, sharing her experience of feeling lonely as a child of very busy parents. She spoke of the generation gap and her efforts to understand and find compromise with her parents, not least over her social media activities. "My mum received messages from her 'friends' about me," she said. "Now that I am a mother myself, I know what my mum went through raising me." Aliya has been active supporting causes such as awareness of children with Downs syndrome and animal rights, but has no obvious political ambitions. People in Kyrgyzstan have recent memories of the two previous presidents' children getting involved in politics and business - both leaders were ousted. But the incumbent leader has pledged that his children will never meddle in politics. Kyrgyzstan is a mainly Muslim ex-Soviet republic. It is socially conservative but breast feeding in public is acceptable. Women are seen in parks and other public spaces feeding their babies, but they usually try and cover their breasts with a piece of clothing. When Ms Shagieva's post first went online some social media users thought there was no need to post a picture of such an intimate moment; others denounced her for not being modest enough. And her breastfeeding photos attracted attention well beyond Kyrgyzstan - they were republished by newspapers and websites as far away as Europe. Many took to social media to praise her for breaking taboos surrounding women's bodies. The question of breastfeeding in public is a matter of debate in many countries, including the UK where only three years ago a woman was asked to cover up in the restaurant of London's famous Claridges Hotel while feeding her baby, causing an outcry. When different BBC language services ran the interview with Aliya Shagieva, the resulting online conversation threw a light on different breastfeeding cultures and practices in Muslim countries. Women writing from Iran shared their experiences about the stress they feel when breastfeeding in public: "People zoom in on me, I have to either cover myself and the baby or just leave him hungry," one Tehran mother wrote. Others praised the recently installed mother and baby rooms in Tehran's Metro. An Afghan woman from Kabul, Zarifa Ghafari, shared a story from her own extended family, saying mothers had to go into a separate room to breastfeed: "She can't do this in front of others. If she did she would face strong reactions from the elder members of the family. It is a big issue but slowly, slowly the culture is changing." Another Afghan woman, Nageen related a shopping trip with her sister in law. "We had to buy some gifts just so she could feed her baby in a shop. She sat there and covered herself with a big scarf." A Turkish Facebook user said, she herself preferred covering up while feeding her baby. "I don't rub it in people's faces. I use a cover. There are many who still sexualize breasts." Victoria Tahmasebi, a women and gender studies expert at Toronto university tweeted: "From a capitalist view point women's breasts can create profit as long as they are sexualised. Breastfeeding in public makes women's breasts less sexy, therefore it is not acceptable." As for Aliya Shagieva's picture which caused a stir - she finally took it down because her parents were worried that the attention "could be harmful to her young family". But it hasn't stopped her speaking out, and it hasn't stopped the debate.
The China-based executive, Xinjiang Jin, is accused of helping to terminate at least four video meetings in May and June, hosted by people based in the US. A warrant is out for his arrest. Zoom said it was co-operating with authorities. China has not commented on the case. The California-based company said it had "terminated" the employee for violating its policies, and had "placed other employees on administrative leave pending the completion" of an internal investigation. The pro-democracy protests and their suppression are strictly taboo in China. What are the allegations? A statement from the US Department of Justice said Xinjiang Jin, also known as Julien Jin, had been charged with "conspiracy to commit interstate harassment and unlawful conspiracy to transfer a means of identification". Prosecutors say that from January 2019 he conspired to "censor the political and religious speech of individuals located in the United States and around the world at the direction and under the control of officials" in the Chinese government. Among the actions taken on behalf of China's government, prosecutors allege that the 39-year-old and others terminated at least four meetings commemorating the 31st anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown, some of which were attended by dissidents who had participated in and survived the protests. They allege that he fabricated violations of Zoom's terms of service to justify his actions to his superiors. "Jin willingly committed crimes, and sought to mislead others at the company, to help [Chinese] authorities censor and punish US users' core political speech merely for exercising their rights to free expression," acting US Attorney Seth DuCharme in Brooklyn said in a statement. According to the statement, the Chinese authorities "took advantage of information provided by Jin to retaliate against and intimidate participants" residing in China or family members of participants based in the country. The statement does not mention Zoom by name, but the company confirmed that its former employee had been charged. "We learned during the course of our investigation that the China-based former employee charged today violated Zoom's policies by, among other things, attempting to circumvent certain internal access controls," it said. It added that the employee "took actions resulting in the termination of several meetings in remembrance of Tiananmen Square and meetings involving religious and/or political activities" and "also shared or directed the sharing of a limited amount of individual user data with Chinese authorities". Mr Jin is living in China and is not in US custody. He faces up to 10 years in prison. What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989? Pro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square in April 1989 and began the largest political demonstrations in communist China's history. They lasted six weeks, with as many as a million people taking part. On the night of 3 June tanks moved in and troops opened fire, killing and injuring many unarmed people in and around Tiananmen Square. Afterwards the authorities claimed no-one had been shot dead in the square itself. Estimates of those killed in the crackdown range from a few hundred to several thousand. China has never given an official figure for how many people died.
By Barbara Plett UsherBBC News The president-elect upset almost 40 years of US practice in the region by taking a call from the Taiwanese leader Tsai Ing-wen. It was an unprecedented breach of the protocol that undergirds the One China Policy, which says Taiwan is part of China and not an independent country. And it raised questions about whether Mr Trump would follow through on campaign pledges to take a tougher line with Beijing. China has identified Taiwan as its most important core interest. Since the Kuomintang retreated to the island in 1949 following defeat in the civil war, China has insisted Taiwan is a renegade province that will eventually be reunited with the mainland. In 1979 the US agreed to go along with this approach, deciding to recognise Beijing instead of Taipei. The One China Policy remains the foundation of that relationship. Was Taiwan phone call planned? Given what's at stake some China experts and politicians have suggested that Donald Trump blundered unknowingly on to sensitive territory with his penchant for improvised diplomacy. "I don't think there was any strategy behind it and I think the effort to push out a story line or a narrative that this was actually a well-thought-about change in direction is highly dubious," the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, told the BBC, saying conflicting accounts made the exchange sound haphazard. Mr Trump's transition team did send mixed messages. His Vice President-elect Michael Pence initially played down the conversation as a courtesy call initiated by Taiwan that was not about policy. But Mr Trump followed up with a confrontational flurry of tweets criticising Beijing's economic and security practices. He showed no remorse and made no gestures to reaffirm the One China Policy. Numerous reports since have detailed the influence of China hawks and Taiwan proponents amongst his advisors. And it's emerged that the call was brokered by the lobbyist and former republican senator Bob Dole, who Taipei has been paying to gain access to Mr Trump's inner circle. "I think it was prearranged and deliberate and Donald Trump knew what it was about," says Walter Lohman, Director of Asian Studies at the conservative Heritage Foundation. The meaning of the call So what was it about? In and of itself, the call is not a policy shift. The One China agreement doesn't specifically prohibit contact between American and Taiwanese leaders, although past US presidents have refrained from picking up the phone so as not to upset China. And right from 1979, there was criticism in Washington over US treatment of Taiwan, says Robert Daly, Director for the Kissinger Institute on China at the Woodrow Wilson Center. That's especially so among Republicans, who have longstanding personal and in some cases business ties with the democratic country that seems a more like-minded ally than Beijing. The talk among Mr Trump's advisers is not about recognising Taiwan, but regularising the way the US interacts with it, says Mr Lohman, which does not mean overturning the One China Policy. It's doubtful Beijing would see it that way. Trump's broader China invective As for President-elect Trump, there is no policy yet on Taiwan, or on China more broadly - or even a discernible strategy. But there has been extraordinarily fiery campaign rhetoric. As a candidate, Mr Trump accused Beijing of "raping" the United States with its trade policies and threatened to levy a punishing tariff on Chinese goods. Hard-line Republicans have welcomed the Taiwan telephone call as evidence that Mr Trump the president would continue confronting China. "He showed the dictators in Beijing that he's not a pushover," Representative Dana Rohrabacher told Fox News. Others have suggested that the president-elect wants to use Taiwan as a bargaining chip for a better economic deal. 'This whole idea of finding ways to strengthen and increase the level of contact with and support for Taiwan is not only sure to drive China crazy, but at the same time give us some leverage over China," says Patrick Cronin at the Center for New American Security. "Because this could become the new normal if we're not happy with the overall relationship." The China response Thus far, China has been fairly restrained, blaming Tsai Ing-wen for a "petty trick". The response to the Twitter tirade was tougher - an editorial in the official People's Daily warned that "creating troubles for the China-US relationship is creating troubles for the US itself." But Beijing still left diplomatic space to formulate a new relationship with the Trump administration. Robert Daly predicts a long adjustment period with a more adversarial tone, because the incoming administration appears to see the relationship as fundamentally competitive. That would potentially leave less room for the kind of co-operation President Obama emphasised on global issues such as climate change, and containing North Korea's nuclear militarisation. "The people advising Trump on Taiwan were pleased with the results (of the call)," Mr Daly says. "That likely means similar actions going forward." Mr Trump continues to send mixed signals. Just days after igniting a diplomatic firestorm over Taiwan, he soothed tensions by naming Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, a long-time friend of Beijing, as his Ambassador to China. Still, there are many ways China could respond to further provocations. And it would respond, says Meredith Sumpter of the Eurasiagroup, "in a direct and probably proportional way, but one that hurts US business and commercial interests". Economically, a lot of trade and investment is at stake. When it comes to security issues, Beijing could decide to be more or less aggressive on disputes in the South China Sea and on North Korea sanctions. And it has never dropped its threat of force to settle the status of Taiwan, so the Taiwanese people could end up paying the biggest price. One test of relations could come next month when Ms Tsai is expected to transit through the US on her way to Central America. Her office has denied reports that she will try to meet Mr Trump's transition team. Another could arise in April when the Treasury Department is set to publish a "currency" report that might prompt Mr Trump to act on his threats to label China a currency manipulator.
That's according to Save Face - the national register for professionals who carry out things like fillers and Botox. The warning comes as a BBC survey suggests nearly 50% of men between 18-30 "might consider" having a procedure. The government is about to launch a campaign in England to tackle cosmetic treatments that go wrong. The survey, commissioned by Radio 1 Newsbeat and the Victoria Derbyshire programme, found that of those who'd had a cosmetic procedure in the past, abdominal implants and Botox were among the most common. Save Face says they get more men visiting their site than women now and the number of complaints from them has risen dramatically. "There is a definite trend of men seeking these procedures and in turn men who are suffering complications when procedures go wrong," says Ashton Collins from the group. She says images on social media and programmes like Love Island and Geordie Shore are partly responsible for men wanting to change their bodies. And it seems the perfect torso is what a lot of men under 30 are aiming for. As part of this BBC survey of around 2,000 men and women, respondents were asked what part of them they would most like to change - the most popular choices among men were their stomach and chest, with 34% selecting them. Worried about his chest, Mike decided to have surgery to reduce what he calls his "man boobs." "You'd be out at the gym and you'd be conscious of it. Everywhere you go you are conscious of it," he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat Two weeks after his operation he insists he has had no complications and is really pleased that he went ahead with it. "I Just feel so confident. It almost makes you feel more masculine, more manly," he says. Diren Kartel is an online personal trainer. He says a lot of men tell him they want to improve the shape of their torsos. "Even me, when I first started training, I wanted abs. When I was younger, I wanted abs. Every guy wants abs." But he says having abdominal definition doesn't always mean you are healthy and he would recommend exercise and a balanced diet to get the body you want. "Even thinking about doing surgery to get abs is shocking. That is not going to fix the problem. If anything they are creating more of a problem doing that. "I would advise you don't do it. If you train well, if you eat well, and change your lifestyle instead of trying to fix something as a quick fix it is going to be so much more beneficial for you." Diren isn't afraid to call out celebrities and online influencers who aren't truthful about how they get their bodies Instagram ready. "All these celebrities having the perfect physique, if as a kid you don't have this, it might seem that this is a problem. "If the celebrity is purposely promoting the fact that having abs is being healthy then that is wrong as it isn't the case." Ashton Collins from Save Face is concerned that some men may be more likely to fall victim to badly-done procedures because they are embarrassed to talk about wanting to have something done. "For men, there is still a barrier to talk about it openly with friends as women would which can leave them falling foul to bad practice and falling in to the wrong hands," she says. "There are a lot of men that are going on social media and finding the cheapest price they come across which inevitably leads to complications."

Five thousand young adults in India, Brazil, Germany, China and the USA were asked to name a person they associated with contemporary UK arts and culture. Shakespeare was the most popular response, with an overall score of 14%. The result emerged from a wider piece of research for the British Council. The Queen and David Beckham came second and third respectively. Other popular responses included JK Rowling, Adele, The Beatles, Paul McCartney and Elton John. Shakespeare proved most popular in China where he was mentioned by 25% of respondents. The lowest score - 6% - was in the US. Other events to mark Shakespeare's birthday on Wednesday include a launch event for Shakespeare's Globe theatre's two-year world tour of Hamlet. The tour aims to visit every country in the world. Venues will include Wittenberg in Germany, the Roman theatres of Philippopolis in Bulgaria and Heraclea in Macedonia, the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington and the Mayan ruins of Copan in Honduras. The poet Michael Rosen wrote a celebratory poem for BBC Radio 4's PM programme in which he picked out his favourite insults from Shakespeare's works for use by people on social media. It includes the lines: "Thou cream faced loon There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune Thou art baser than a cutpurse." As part of the Royal Shakespeare Company's special celebrations, artistic director Gregory Doran will answer questions from 10am submitted via the RSC's Twitter account. There will also be a firework display from the top of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon after the evening performance of Henry IV Part I. Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616 at the age of 52. His actual birth date in 1564 is unknown but it is traditionally celebrated on 23 April. The British Council - which promotes British culture around the world - is planning a major international programme of events for 2016, the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death. "The 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death is the biggest opportunity to put UK culture on the world stage since London 2012," said Sir Martin Davidson, chief executive of the British Council. "As the most widely read and studied author in the English language, Shakespeare provides an important connection to the UK for millions of people around the world, and the world will be looking to celebrate this anniversary with the UK. We hope that the UK's cultural organisations will come together to meet these expectations and ensure that 2016 is our next Olympic moment."
Education Secretary Michael Gove and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will confirm the plans for reform. Pupils who have begun secondary school this year will be the first to take the revised exams in 2017. Mr Clegg promised that the changes would "give parents confidence" in the exams taken by their children. But Labour's shadow education secretary, Stephen Twigg, attacked the plans as "totally out of date, from a Tory-led government totally out of touch with modern Britain". "Schools do need to change as all children stay on in education to 18 and we face up to the challenges of the 21st Century. We won't achieve that with a return to the 1980s," said Mr Twigg. Single exam board Details of the changes to GCSEs in England will be formally announced to MPs on Monday afternoon. But a series of leaks have suggested that the shake-up will mean that the current system of assessing individual units of a course will be replaced by a single three-hour final exam. The first pupils would begin studying these exams in 2015 - with the first candidates taking the new-look exams in 2017. There is also likely to be one exam board for each subject - rather than having different exam boards competing with their own versions. There have been claims that such competition leads to a "race to the bottom", with an incentive for exam boards to attract more business by making it easier to pass. It is also expected to be made more difficult to get the highest grades - with the suggestion that the A* and A grades will be replaced with a top level that fewer children will be able to achieve. A leak during the exam season had claimed that GCSEs would be abolished and replaced with an O-level for the more able and a separate exam for pupils of a lower ability. But this prompted a dispute within the coalition over introducing such a two-tier system - which seems to have been resolved to create a single exam for all ability levels. Leaving age Addressing the education select committee last week, Mr Gove suggested that an exam could be taken at different points between 16 and 18 years of age - allowing weaker pupils to catch up. The changes to the GCSE exam will come alongside the raising of the leaving age - which will see young people staying in education and training until the age of 18. Mr Clegg said the changes would "raise standards for all our children", but he added that it would "not exclude any children". He said it would have been wrong to go back the old dual exam system - and set out what he hoped would be gained from the revised GCSEs. "Firstly give parents confidence in the exams their children are taking, secondly raise standards for all our children in schools in the country but thirdly and crucially not exclude any children from the new exam system." When more details of the new exam were leaked at the weekend, Labour said it supported more rigorous exams but only if they do not act as a cap on aspiration. A reform of the exam system in England will not apply to pupils taking GCSEs in Wales - and this shake-up could see a greater divide between qualifications in England and Wales. The Welsh government says it will not be rushed into following any changes to the GCSE and is carrying out its own separate review into the exam system. Changes to the GCSE in England would not apply to Northern Ireland. Former chief inspector of schools Sir Mike Tomlinson - who conducted a review of the exam system for the previous government - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he thought the planned change was "largely positive". He backed the move away from a modular system and plans for there to be only one board to examine in English, mathematics or the sciences. Back to the future? But he questioned how subjects that do not lend themselves to a single exam, such as art and dance, would be tested in a single exam. Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said GCSEs needed to be reviewed but bringing back an O-level style exam was not the answer. "I hope that these proposals are not going to be telling us that we're going to have a system that goes back to something that we used to have in the 1950s, which was suited to a very small part of the population," he said. Martin Johnson of the ATL teachers' union said: "A new exam certainly should not be designed on the back of a restaurant menu as a short-term political fix by ignorant ministers. This is an insult to the nation's children who will have to live with the consequences if the crackpot ideas are implemented." "Tinkering with exams is a cheap and relatively easy lever for governments, which has been used and over-used in the past couple of decades. What would make a real, long-term difference to raising standards for all children would be improving the teaching and learning in all schools - but that's long, and hard, and expensive," said Kevin Stannard of the Girls' Day School Trust. The plan to reform the exam system comes amid controversy over this year's GCSE English exams - with head teachers claiming that grade boundaries have been unfairly altered. The exam regulator in England has refused to regrade the disputed papers - but the Welsh government has instructed the WJEC examining board to carry out a regrading in Wales. In Scotland, pupils take Standard Grades, Highers and Advanced Highers rather than GCSEs and A-levels.
By John Sudworth BBC News, Xinjiang At the same time as hundreds of thousands of adults are being detained in giant camps, a rapid, large-scale campaign to build boarding schools is under way. Based on publicly available documents, and backed up by dozens of interviews with family members overseas, the BBC has gathered some of the most comprehensive evidence to date about what is happening to children in the region. Records show that in one township alone more than 400 children have lost not just one but both parents to some form of internment, either in the camps or in prison. Formal assessments are carried out to determine whether the children are in need of "centralised care". Alongside the efforts to transform the identity of Xinjiang's adults, the evidence points to a parallel campaign to systematically remove children from their roots. China's tight surveillance and control in Xinjiang, where foreign journalists are followed 24 hours a day, make it impossible to gather testimony there. But it can be found in Turkey. In a large hall in Istanbul, dozens of people queue to tell their stories, many of them clutching photographs of children, all now missing back home in Xinjiang. "I don't know who is looking after them," one mother says, pointing to a picture of her three young daughters, "there is no contact at all." Another mother, holding a photo of three sons and a daughter, wipes away her tears. "I heard that they've been taken to an orphanage," she says. In 60 separate interviews, in wave after wave of anxious, grief-ridden testimony, parents and other relatives give details of the disappearance in Xinjiang of more than 100 children. They are all Uighurs - members of Xinjiang's largest, predominantly Muslim ethnic group that has long had ties of language and faith to Turkey. Thousands have come to study or to do business, to visit family, or to escape China's birth control limits and the increasing religious repression. But over the past three years, they have found themselves trapped after China began detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other minorities in giant camps. The Chinese authorities say the Uighurs are being educated in "vocational training centres" in order to combat violent religious extremism. But evidence shows that many are being detained for simply expressing their faith - praying or wearing a veil - or for having overseas connections to places like Turkey. For these Uighurs, going back means almost certain detention. Phone contact has been severed - even speaking to relatives overseas is now too dangerous for those in Xinjiang. With his wife detained back home, one father tells me he fears some of his eight children may now be in the care of the Chinese state. "I think they've been taken to child education camps," he says. New research commissioned by the BBC sheds light on what is really happening to these children and many thousands of others. Dr Adrian Zenz is a German researcher widely credited with exposing the full extent of China's mass detentions of adult Muslims in Xinjiang. Based on publicly available official documents, his report paints a picture of an unprecedented school expansion drive in Xinjiang. Campuses have been enlarged, new dormitories built and capacity increased on a massive scale. Significantly, the state has been growing its ability to care full-time for large numbers of children at precisely the same time as it has been building the detention camps. And it appears to be targeted at precisely the same ethnic groups. In just one year, 2017, the total number of children enrolled in kindergartens in Xinjiang increased by more than half a million. And Uighur and other Muslim minority children, government figures show, made up more than 90% of that increase. As a result, Xinjiang's pre-school enrolment level has gone from below the national average to the highest in China by far. In the south of Xinjiang alone, an area with the highest concentration of Uighur populations, the authorities have spent an eye watering $1.2bn on the building and upgrading of kindergartens. Mr Zenz's analysis suggests that this construction boom has included the addition of large amounts of dormitory space. Xinjiang's education expansion is driven, it appears, by the same ethos as underlies the mass incarceration of adults. And it is clearly affecting almost all Uighur and other minority children, whether their parents are in the camps or not. In 2018 work began on a site for two new boarding schools in Xinjiang's southern city of Yecheng (known as Kargilik in Uighur). Yecheng County Middle Schools 10 and 11 Dragging the slider reveals the pace of construction - the two middle schools, separated by a shared sports field, are each three times larger than the national average and were built in little more than a year. In April last year, the county authorities relocated 2,000 children from the surrounding villages into yet another giant boarding middle school, Yecheng County Number 4. Government propaganda extols the virtues of boarding schools as helping to "maintain social stability and peace" with the "school taking the place of the parents." And Mr Zenz suggests there is a deeper purpose. "Boarding schools provide the ideal context for a sustained cultural re-engineering of minority societies," he argues. Just as with the camps, his research shows that there is now a concerted drive to all but eliminate the use of Uighur and other local languages from school premises. Individual school regulations outline strict, points-based punishments for both students and teachers if they speak anything other than Chinese while in school. And this aligns with other official statements claiming that Xinjiang has already achieved full Chinese language teaching in all of its schools. Speaking to the BBC, Xu Guixiang, a senior official with Xinjiang's Propaganda Department, denies that the state is having to care for large numbers of children left parentless as a result. "If all family members have been sent to vocational training then that family must have a severe problem," he says, laughing. "I've never seen such a case." But perhaps the most significant part of Mr Zenz's work is his evidence that shows that the children of detainees are indeed being channelled into the boarding school system in large numbers. There are the detailed forms used by local authorities to log the situations of children with parents in vocational training or in prison, and to determine whether they need centralised care. Mr Zenz found one government document that details various subsidies available to "needy groups", including those families where "both a husband and a wife are in vocational training". And a directive issued to education bureaus by the city of Kashgar that mandates them to look after the needs of students with parents in the camps as a matter of urgency. Schools should "strengthen psychological counselling", the directive says, and "strengthen students' thought education" - a phrase that finds echoes in the camps holding their parents. It is clear that the effect of the mass internments on children is now viewed as a significant societal issue, and that some effort is going into dealing with it, although it is not something the authorities are keen to publicise. Some of the relevant government documents appear to have been deliberately hidden from search engines by using obscure symbols in place of the term "vocational training". That said, in some instances the adult detention camps have kindergartens built close by, and, when visiting, Chinese state media reporters have extolled their virtues. These boarding schools, they say, allow minority children to learn "better life habits" and better personal hygiene than they would at home. Some children have begun referring to their teachers as "mummy". We telephoned a number of local Education Bureaus in Xinjiang to try to find out about the official policy in such cases. Most refused to speak to us, but some gave brief insights into the system. We asked one official what happens to the children of those parents who have been taken to the camps. "They're in boarding schools," she replied. "We provide accommodation, food and clothes… and we've been told by the senior level that we must look after them well." In the hall in Istanbul, as the stories of broken families come tumbling out, there is raw despair and deep resentment too. "Thousands of innocent children are being separated from their parents and we are giving our testimonies constantly," one mother tells me. "Why does the world keep silent when knowing these facts?" Back in Xinjiang, the research shows that all children now find themselves in schools that are secured with "hard isolation closed management measures." Many of the schools bristle with full-coverage surveillance systems, perimeter alarms and 10,000 Volt electric fences, with some school security spending surpassing that of the camps. The policy was issued in early 2017, at a time when the detentions began to be dramatically stepped up. Was the state, Mr Zenz wonders, seeking to pre-empt any possibility on the part of Uighur parents to forcibly recover their children? "I think the evidence for systematically keeping parents and children apart is a clear indication that Xinjiang's government is attempting to raise a new generation cut off from original roots, religious beliefs and their own language," he tells me. "I believe the evidence points to what we must call cultural genocide."
Jobandeep Sandhu is a hard worker. The 22-year-old worked pretty much full time as a truck driver while studying to be a technical engineer, so he could help put himself and his brother through college in Ontario. "My thinking was that working isn't a crime," he said. But now the Indian citizen is facing deportation after he was arrested for working too many hours as an international student. Sandhu's student visa stipulated that he can only work off-campus up to 20 hours a week during the school year. Yet some weeks he was working as much as 40. Sandhu said he did this because his parents could not afford the high cost of international tuition for both himself and his brother, plus the living expenses. When an officer pulled him over during a routine traffic stop and asked to see his trucking log books, Sandhu readily turned them over. "I was working legally, I was paying taxes," he said. "I thought that I don't need to lie." Since then, he has had to hire a lawyer to fight his deportation, which is scheduled for 21 May. Sandhu is not alone in struggling to pay the bills. There are currently more than 500,000 international students in Canada, and international tuition rates have risen 32% across the country, compared to 14% for domestic students. Since his arrest, several advocates have spoken about the need to be more accommodating of international students who need to work. "They absolutely need to be able to seek employment," says Adam Brown, chair of the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations and a student at the University of Alberta. The calls for change come at a time when Canada is trying to aggressively compete with other countries around the world to attract international students. For years local and federal governments have been pulling out all the stops to draw in students from around the world. Canada has relaxed rules around off-campus work and made it easier for international students to get a work visa after graduation or apply for permanent residency. The latest federal budget has earmarked $148m (£86m) over the next five years, in part "to promote Canadian education institutions as high-calibre places to study". Economics 101 It is all about the bottom line, according to Dani Zaretsky, an international student recruiter. "Globally - it's not just Canada - there's no mistaking it's all about money," says Zaretsky, who co-founded recruitment company Higher Edge and has worked with several Canadian universities and colleges to help boost international student enrolment. "If there are other benefits [like diversity], they're welcome, but it's not the point." On average, international students in Canada can expect to pay four times more tuition than domestic students. Similar formulas apply in other countries. At the University of California in San Diego, where about 20% of students come from outside the US and pay $40,327 a year in tuition, which is about three times the in-state rate. A similar number of students at the UK's University of Manchester also come from abroad, and pay £18,500 a year in tuition, twice the rate of domestic students. At a time when many governments are cutting back on their education spending, international students are a crucial form of revenue for many institutions. Canada is ranked sixth in the world as a destination for international students, according to research conducted by research group Project Atlas. That puts it behind the US, UK, China, Australia and France - and down two spots from the year before. Why Canada? So what makes an international student willing to shell out so much cash? For Bangladeshi student Kazi Mridul, it was the promise of a high-quality technical education, coupled with Canada's reputation as a welcoming, multicultural country. "There's more funding for research, especially in the STEM field [science, technology, engineering and maths]," said Mridul, who is studying engineering at Toronto's York University. Canada also makes it easy for international students to apply for a post-graduate work permit, a policy the UK has discussed adopting, to increase its appeal abroad. But Mridul says the visa process could still be easier. "School accepted me in March, but until August I didn't know if I was coming or not," he says. Do students get what they pay for? The Ministry of Global Affairs estimated that in 2014 alone, international students spent $11.4 billion in the Canadian economy. Since then, the number of international students has grown from 330,170 to 572,415 - an almost 75% increase. Meanwhile, average international tuition fees have been raised from $20,593 to $27,159, or by about 32%. Yet it is not clear that international students are getting any more for their dollar than they were before. Zaretsky says services have not kept up. If Canada is really committed to attracting more international students, it should be clear about what it's offering them, he says, and that includes an opportunity to work once they arrive. He also thinks schools need to be careful about how much they raise tuition, year-to-year. "Sometimes they'll raise it 10-12% in a fell swoop, and for families that have budgeted carefully that's a rude shock," he says. Ultimately, Mridul does think his Canadian education was worth it. "It's not just the education, it's the whole experience," he says. "It's all the other people that are here. In Bangladesh we have a very homogenous society... here it's the exposure to everything."
By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website A trial on 163 heart failure patients found supplements of the vitamin, which is made in the skin when exposed to sunlight, improved their hearts' ability to pump blood around the body. The Leeds Teaching Hospitals team, who presented at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology, described the results as "stunning". The British Heart Foundation called for longer trials to assess the pills. Vitamin D is vital for healthy bones and teeth and may have important health benefits throughout the body but many people are deficient. No safe way to suntan - warning The average age of people in the study was 70 and, like many people that age, they had low levels of vitamin D even in summer. "They do spend less time outside, but the skin's ability to manufacture vitamin D also gets less effective [with age] and we don't really understand why that is," said consultant cardiologist Dr Klaus Witte. Patients were given either a 100 microgram vitamin D tablet or a sugar pill placebo each day for a year. And researchers measured the impact on heart failure - a condition in which the heart becomes too weak to pump blood properly. The key measure was the ejection fraction, the amount of blood pumped out of the chambers of the heart with each beat. In a healthy adult, the figure is between 60% and 70%, but only a quarter of the blood in the heart was being successfully pumped out in the heart failure patients. But in those taking the vitamin pills, the ejection fraction increased from 26% to 34%. Dr Witte told the BBC News website: "It's quite a big deal, that's as big as you'd expect from other more expensive treatments that we use, it's a stunning effect. "It's as cheap as chips, has no side effects and a stunning improvement on people already on optimal medical therapy, it is the first time anyone has shown something like this in the last 15 years." The study also showed the patients' hearts became smaller - a suggestion they are becoming more powerful and efficient. In the UK, people over 65 are advised to take 10 microgram supplements of the vitamin. However, Dr Witte does not think high-dose vitamin D should be routine prescribed just yet. He told the BBC: "We're a little bit off that yet, not because I don't believe it, but data have shown improvements in heart function, they may show improvements in symptoms and we now need a large study." It is also not clear exactly how vitamin D is improving heart function, but it is thought every cell in the body responds to the vitamin. Most vitamin D comes from sunlight, although it is also found in oily fish, eggs and is added to some foods such as breakfast cereals. Prof Peter Weissberg, from the British Heart Foundation, cautioned that the patients seemed no better at exercise. And added: "A much bigger study over a longer period of time is now needed to determine whether these changes in cardiac function can translate into fewer symptoms and longer lives for heart failure patients."

The tech giant has hired Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan to manage the sale. Alibaba would offer dollar-denominated notes to institutional investors, the company said in a statement. Reports suggest that Alibaba would sell $8bn (£5bn) in bonds after its record public listing just two months ago. News of Alibaba's bond sale comes after it made $9bn in sales on Singles' Day in China this week, which is considered the world's biggest online sales day. In September, the company's initial public offering in New York was the biggest in the world, raising $25bn and its stock is up nearly 70% since then. Alibaba will hold meetings next week in Boston, New York, Hong Kong, London and Singapore. US ratings firm Moody's has given the proposed bond an A1 credit rating.
"I think truly progress has been made," the US president said, declaring the relationship as "outstanding". The two men and their staff sat face to face for talks at Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida. Last year Mr Trump said China had "raped the US" and vowed to brand the superpower a currency manipulator. But at a welcome banquet it was all smiles and the good spirits appeared to continue on Friday as Mr Xi's visit concluded with a working lunch. On the night of the Chinese president's arrival, a US airstrike on an airbase in Syria was launched in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack. The attack was made public on Thursday evening just moments after Mr Xi and his wife left the resort following dinner. Beijing has avoided publicly taking sides on the issue. Xi likely to be angry - Carrie Gracie, BBC China editor China's position on Syria is much closer to Russia's than to the US. And the Chinese government will guess that the timing of the American missile strike was a blunt message that without more robust Chinese help on dismantling Kim Jong-un's nuclear programme, the next target for pre-emptive American military action might be North Korea. In Chinese protocol, sudden moves disrupting setpiece occasions are avoided wherever possible, and in private, President Xi is likely to be angry that President Trump chose to strike on the very night of his visit. But in public Mr Xi stuck to his script about the virtues of co-operation while Mr Trump insisted they'd formed an outstanding relationship and made great progress. As the two presidents went into their final lunch there were no specifics though, and in the aftermath of the US missile strike on Syria, all the big questions which bedevil the US China relationship have been kicked down the road for President Trump's visit to China later this year. "We have made tremendous progress in our relationship with China," Mr Trump said on Friday, without going into detail. Mr Xi urged co-operation on trade and invited his host to visit China. According to a statement on China's foreign ministry website, Mr Xi told Mr Trump: "We have a thousand reasons to get China-US relations right, and not one reason to spoil the China-US relationship." An A-Z of hot topics for Trump and Xi What can Trump do about trade with China? The cost of Trump's 'Winter White House' On Thursday evening, they dined on pan-seared Dover sole and New York strip steak in an ornate candle-lit private dining room decked with red and yellow flowers. Mr Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who both work at the White House, were also among guests. The leaders of the world's two most powerful economies are a study in contrasts - one a softly spoken Communist Party apparatchik and the other a brash Manhattan property tycoon. During the election campaign, Mr Trump said massive trade deficits and job losses could no longer be tolerated. But he has so far not followed through on his threat to formally brand China a "currency manipulator", nor to hit Chinese imports with punitive tariffs. The Republican president's blue-collar supporters hope he can translate his China-bashing election rhetoric into concrete gains for American manufacturing workers. One of the most urgent issues for the US is nuclear-armed North Korea, which is trying to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the west coast of the US. Beijing has so far been chary of isolating its neighbour, fearing its collapse could spawn a refugee crisis and bring the US military to its doorstep. Some protesters lined the streets on Thursday to voice their opposition to China's policy in the South China Sea.
By Andrew WalkerBBC World Service economics correspondent The short answer is: "Yes." Africa has been adversely affected, although not so much as to snuff out the real improvement over the past two decades. Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa is, according to IMF projections, slowing to 3.8% this year, the slowest since 1999. Slower, in other words than during the global financial crisis. That projection, released in October, is also down from the 4.4% the IMF published just three months earlier. It is still, however, faster than the increase in population. So economic activity per person, which is a rough, if flawed indicator of average living standards, is still rising. In all but 10 of the 45 individual African countries, gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is likely to rise this year. And next year, the IMF forecasts, Africa will regain a bit more momentum, with growth of 4.3%. In the 11 years after the turn of the century, the economy of sub-Saharan Africa doubled in size. In 1993, GDP per person was about the same as in 1970. By 2010, it was 50% higher. China was an important factor, though it can't claim all the credit. There were real improvements in political stability and economic policy in Africa, although some analysis suggests progress in this area may have stalled since the financial crisis. And China emerged as a major source of finance for investment in new commodity extraction and helped boost the international market price for African exports. The consultants McKinsey estimated a quarter of Africa's economic growth between 2002 and 2007 came from energy, metals and other natural resources. There was a further indirect contribution in the shape of government spending financed by revenue from taxes on resource industries. More on China in Africa: The BBC is running a series of pieces about China's role in Africa ahead of the China-Africa summit on 4-5 December in South Africa. In the first decade of the century, base metal and energy prices gained by more than 160%, according to the World Bank. For precious metals, the rise was above 300%, and for agricultural commodities over 100%. Chinese demand for commodities was a key force behind these rising prices. New projects with high costs or in inaccessible locations were made more profitable. But now, the commodity price boom is over. Oil, copper, and aluminium have all fallen by about half from the peaks they reached in the past few years. Iron ore has fallen even more. And these are all important exports for a number of African countries. To take one example, the international commodities producer and trader Glencore has decided to suspend production at copper mines in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. And China's slowing growth and its shift towards service industries is a central part of the explanation. The IMF says oil exporters are facing a formidable adverse shock. The big ones are Nigeria and Angola, and they generally get half of government revenues from oil-related activities. The lower oil price will probably lead to investment in new oil production capacity being postponed. The IMF suggests this is especially likely in East Africa. Africa's biggest oil producers are indeed seeing slower growth this year - Nigeria 4% after 6.3% last year, and Angola 3.5% compared with 4.8% in 2014. Strong supply from oil cartel Opec countries and from North American shale oil is perhaps the key force driving prices down. But cooling demand for oil from China is probably also involved. Exporters of other commodities account for 40% of population and economic activity of sub-Saharan Africa. They too will be affected by the decline in prices, but the IMF says the impact will be less than on the oil exporters and they will also get some benefit from cheaper oil. It will enable them to reduce spending on fuel subsidies - or if the lower price is passed on to users, there should be a boost to consumer spending. All the same, the World Bank is concerned about the impact. It said earlier this year: "Revenue dependence on the commodity sector remains high." And if governments scaled back on social services and infrastructure, "gains in poverty reduction could be lost and prospects for future growth could be damaged by growing infrastructure deficiencies and bottlenecks". Zambia's central bank raised interest rates sharply a couple of weeks ago, up to 15.5%, to curb the inflation that had resulted from a weakening currency, which was in turn down to the decline in the price of the country's copper exports. The economic growth expected in Africa in the next few years is perhaps a bit of a disappointment after the first decade of the century. Faster growth would do more to ease the continent's persistent poverty problem. But even so, it is a very different and brighter prospect than what Africa went through in the 1980s.
The Culture Secretary told the Sunday Telegraph that voters had legitimate fears over "excessive" immigration. Mr Javid, elected Conservative MP for Bromsgrove in 2010, criticised migrants who had lived in Britain for many years but still could not speak the language. He also said there was no place for Sharia law in the English legal system. 'Laws and culture' Mr Javid, the son of Pakistani immigrants, said: "People want Britain to have more control over its borders, and I think they are right. "People also say, when immigrants do come to Britain, that they should come to work, and make a contribution and that they should also respect our way of life, and I agree with all of that. It means things like trying to learn English." He added: "I know people myself, I have met people who have been in Britain for over 50 years and they still can't speak English. "I think it's perfectly reasonable for British people to say 'look, if you're going to settle in Britain and make it your home you should learn the language of the country and you should respect its laws and its culture'." Mr Javid spoke amid reports that Sharia courts have been established in cities such as London, Birmingham, Bradford and Manchester. He said: "Where people want to have their own private arrangements between them, that is a matter for them. But there is no place for Sharia law in British law." Mr Javid also expressed concern about allegations of a plot by Muslim radicals to "Islamise" state schools in Birmingham. He went on to say that the "vast majority" of immigrants wanted to integrate with the rest of society in the UK. 'Not new' Mr Javid is the first Asian male in the cabinet, after Baroness Warsi became the first Muslim female in her role as co-chairman of the Conservative Party. Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Javid's comments did not represent anything new. Mr Vaz told BBC Radio 5 live: "It was a Labour government that introduced an English language test for those who wanted to get indefinite leave to enter the country. "This is not new; it's just interesting because it's been said by the first Asian cabinet minister. Politicians have been saying this of all parties. "Of course we want people to learn English, of course we want people who come into this country to respect our values. We're not suggesting otherwise." Mr Javid's interview came a day after the Daily Mail reported that immigrants who could not speak English had been able to buy documents saying they had passed a language test.
The decision was made after 14 of the laureates threatened to boycott the event. The mayor of Cape Town, Patricia De Lille, supported the boycott, criticising the government's "intransigence". South Africa has denied the Dalai Lama a visa three times in five years. Remembering Mandela The 14th World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates was scheduled to start next week but organisers say it will now be moved to another country. Attendees were planning to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the end of apartheid as well as honour the late Nelson Mandela, himself a Nobel Peace Prize recipient. The Dalai Lama on Thursday accused South Africa of "bullying a simple person". It has been suggested that South Africa is trying to ally with China, which views the Tibetan spiritual leader as a separatist. Desmond Tutu, another Nobel Peace Prize winner and a South African, also criticised the government. "I'm ashamed to call this lickspittle bunch my government," he said.
By Tim HarfordBBC World Service, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy My left-hand little finger holds the shift key, then the other fingers of my left hand clumsily crab sideways across the upper row. Q-W-E-R-T-Y. There's a lesson here: it matters where the keys sit on your keyboard. There are good arrangements and bad ones. Many people think that qwerty is a bad one - in fact, that it was deliberately designed to be slow and awkward. Could that be true? And why do economists, of all people, argue about this? It turns out that the stakes are higher than they might first appear. Find out more: 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service.

But let's start by figuring out why anyone might have been perverse enough to want to slow down typists. In the early 1980s, I persuaded my mother Deb to let me use her mechanical typewriter, a miraculous contraption which would transcend my awful handwriting. When I hit a key, a lever would flick up from behind the keyboard and whack hard against an inked ribbon, squeezing that ink against a sheet of paper. On the end of the lever - called a type bar - would be a pair of reversed letters in relief. I discovered that if I hit several keys at once, the type bars all flew up at the same time into the same spot. Fun for a nine-year-old boy, less so for a professional typist. Typing at 60 words per minute (wpm) - no stretch for a good typist - means five or six letters striking the same spot each second. At such a speed, the typist might need to be slowed down for the sake of the typewriter. That is what qwerty supposedly did. Then again, if qwerty really was designed to be slow, how come the most popular pair of letters in English, T-H, are adjacent and right under the index fingers? The plot thickens. The father of the qwerty keyboard was Christopher Latham Sholes, a printer from Wisconsin who sold his first typewriter in 1868 to Porter's Telegraph College, Chicago. That bit's important. The qwerty layout was designed for the convenience of telegraph operators transcribing Morse code - that's why, for example, the Z is next to the S and the E, because Z and SE are indistinguishable in American Morse code. The telegraph receiver would hover over those letters, waiting for context to make everything clear. So the qwerty keyboard wasn't designed to be slow. But it wasn't designed for the convenience of you and me, either. So why do we still use it? The simple answer is that qwerty won a battle for dominance in the 1880s. Sholes' design was taken up by the gunsmiths E Remington and Sons. They finalised the layout and put it on the market for $125 - perhaps $3,000 (£2,271) in today's money, many months' income for the secretaries who would have used it. It wasn't the only typewriter around - Sholes has been described as the "52nd man to invent the typewriter" - but the qwerty keyboard emerged victorious. The Remington company cannily provided qwerty typing courses, and when it merged with four major rivals in 1893, they all adopted what became known as "the universal layout". And this brief struggle for market dominance in 1880s America determines the keyboard layout on today's iPads. Nobody then was thinking about our interests - but their actions control ours. And that's a shame, because more logical layouts exist: notably the Dvorak, designed by August Dvorak and patented in 1932. It favours the dominant hand (left and right-hand layouts are available) and puts the most-used keys together. The US Navy conducted a study in the 1940s demonstrating that the Dvorak was vastly superior: training typists to use the Dvorak layout would pay for itself many times over. So why didn't we all switch to Dvorak? The problem lay in co-ordinating the switch. Qwerty had been the universal layout since before Dvorak was born. Most typists trained on it. Any employer investing in a costly typewriter would naturally choose the layout that most typists could use, especially when economies of scale made it the cheapest model on the market. Dvorak keyboards never stood a chance. So now we start to see why this case matters. Many economists argue qwerty is the quintessential example of something they call "lock in". This isn't really about typewriters. It's about Microsoft Office and Windows, Amazon's control of the online retail link between online buyers and sellers, and Facebook's dominance of social media. More things that made the modern economy: How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff What leaded petrol says about the limits of regulation? How the plough changed everything How Ikea's Billy bookcase took over the world If all your friends are on Facebook apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp, doesn't that lock you in as surely as a qwerty typist? This matters. The lock-in is the friend of monopolists, the enemy of competition, and may require a robust response from regulators. But maybe dominant standards are dominant not because of lock-in, but just because the alternatives simply aren't as compelling as we imagine. Consider the famous Navy study that demonstrated the superiority of the Dvorak keyboard. Two economists, Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis, unearthed that study, and concluded it was badly flawed. They also raised an eyebrow at the name of the man who supervised it - the Navy's leading time-and-motion expert, one Lieutenant-Commander… August Dvorak. Liebowitz and Margolis don't deny that the Dvorak design may be better: the world's fastest alphanumeric typists do use Dvorak's layout. In 2008, Barbara Bradford was recorded maintaining a speed of 150 words per minute (wpm) for 50 minutes, and reached a top speed of 212 wpm using such a keyboard. But they were just not convinced that this was ever an example where an entire society was desperate to switch to a hugely superior standard yet unable to co-ordinate. And in fact these days, most of us peck away at our own emails, on devices which can actually let you switch your keyboard layout. Windows, iOS and Android all offer Dvorak layouts. You no longer need to persuade your co-workers, other employers and secretarial schools to switch with you. If you want it, you can just use it. Nobody else is even going to notice. Yet most of us stick with qwerty. The door is no longer locked, but we can't be bothered to escape. Lock-in seems to be entrenching the position of some of the most powerful and valuable companies in the world today - including Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. Maybe those locks are as unbreakable as the qwerty standard once seemed. Or maybe they risk being crow-barred off if restless consumers are tempted by something better. After all, it wasn't that long ago that people worried about users being locked in to MySpace.

A saw-whet owl is recovering at a wildlife refuge in New York state after it was discovered clinging to the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree. The bird was found by workers helping to transport the spruce 170 miles from Oneonta, New York, to New York City. "It's just a story out of a movie," said Ravensbeard Wildlife Center director Ellen Kalish, who is caring for the owl. After the feathered stowaway - now named Rockefeller - was dropped off with Ms Kalish and taken to the wildlife centre, her team began giving him fluids and "all the mice he will eat". Rockefeller had not had anything to eat or drink during his three-day road trip. "It's amazing he didn't get crushed," Ms Kalish said. Rockefeller was taken to the vet on Wednesday night for a check-up and some X-rays, but Ms Kalish said he appears to be in great condition considering his adventurous week. "So far, he's pensive and cautious. Very alert, bright-eyed," she said. "And the cuteness factor is just off the charts." Despite Rockefeller's diminutive size, he is a full-grown adult. Saw-whet owls are the smallest owls in the US north-east, Ms Kalish said, typically growing to no more than 8.3in (17-21cm) tall. "They're a very interesting species," Ms Kalish said. They are "very" nocturnal, meaning they're typically not seen unless someone is looking for them. Some migrate south for the winter, and some don't migrate at all. Once Rockefeller has a clean bill of health, Ms Kalish and the Ravensbeard team will release him back into the wild. "Our goal is to release any bird that can be released," she said. There are about two million saw-whet owls across the US, she said, so Rockefeller will be OK if he doesn't make it all the way back to Oneonta. "They find a new mate each year and go on with their lives," she said. With all the bad news of 2020, this tiny owl's rescue "was a story that needed to be shared", Ms Kalish said. And plucky little Rockefeller the owl has lit up this year's Christmas tree with some positive publicity. Social media users had a hoot this week mocking the 75ft (23m) tree for its "sparse" appearance, with some calling it an appropriate tribute to a year to forget.
Mr Sotloff, 31, was abducted in Syria in 2013. He appeared at the end of a video last month which showed fellow US journalist James Foley being killed. A militant in the latest video also threatens to kill a British hostage. Mr Sotloff's family said they were aware of the video and were "grieving privately". After Mr Foley's death, Mr Sotloff's mother appealed to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi to save her son's life. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said US officials were checking the reports. The US has recently carried out dozens of air strikes against IS targets in Iraq. President Barack Obama has ordered the deployment of another 350 troops to Baghdad to protect US diplomatic facilities, the White house has said. Analysis: BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner This second hostage killing video from IS is significant, even though it was largely expected and dreaded. It shows that the recent US air strikes which have halted IS's lightning advance across northern Iraq are causing the organisation real damage, upsetting its plans to extend by force its rule into Kurdistan. Unable to hit back militarily against America's jets, Islamic State has responded with a form of information warfare that it knows will horrify most people in the West. Secondly, by threatening to murder a British hostage, IS shows it makes little or no distinction between the US and Britain as its enemy. This is despite Britain so far restricting itself to dropping aid to refugees and flying in supplies to the Kurdish military, leaving air strikes to the Americans. 'Arrogant policy' The video, entitled "A second message to America", is about two-and-a-half minutes long and was apparently recorded in a desert. It appears to have been filmed after Mr Foley's, though it is impossible to determine the exact timing. It shows a masked figure together with Mr Sotloff, who is dressed in an orange gown. Mr Sotloff reads out a text addressed to Mr Obama saying: "You've spent billions of US taxpayers' dollars and we have lost thousands of our troops in our previous fighting against the Islamic State, so where is the people's interest in reigniting this war?" The masked man, whose voice is similar to that of the man who appeared to carry out the beheading of James Foley, then describes the act he is about to commit as retribution for the US air strikes. "I'm back, Obama, and I'm back because of your arrogant foreign policy towards the Islamic State... despite our serious warnings," the man says. "We take this opportunity to warn those governments that enter this evil alliance of America against the Islamic State to back off and leave our people alone." The video ends with the militant threatening to kill the British captive. 'Absolutely disgusting' US state department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said: "If the video is genuine, we are sickened by this brutal act." She said it was believed that "a few" other Americans were still being held by Islamic State. Mr Earnest urged caution about the veracity of the video. "Our thoughts and prayers, first and foremost, are with Mr Sotloff and Mr Sotloff's family and those who worked with him," he said. "I'm not in a position to confirm the authenticity of that video or the reports. "It's something that will be analysed very carefully by the US government and our intelligence officials to establish its authenticity." UK Prime Minister David Cameron described the apparent beheading as an "absolutely disgusting, despicable act". Mr Cameron's office said he has known for months that a Briton was among the hostages taken by Islamic State and has chaired meetings with high-level officials to discuss the situation. But British officials say they have deliberately not commented on this while there has been what they call "strong family liaison" with relatives of the hostage. 'Unbiased observer' A friend of Mr Sotloff, US film maker Matthew Van Dyke, told the BBC: "He was a complete professional and there was no reason for this to happen to him." Mr Sotloff was abducted near Aleppo in northern Syria in August 2013. He had worked for Time magazine, Foreign Policy and the Christian Science Monitor, and reported from Egypt, Libya and Syria. Time Magazine editor Nancy Gibbs said in a statement that she was "shocked and deeply saddened by reports of Steven Sotloff's death". "He gave his life so readers would have access to information from some of the most dangerous places in the world," she said. Friends said he had lived in Yemen for many years and spoke good Arabic. Last month a video was released showing the beheading of Mr Foley. Mr Sotloff was shown at the end, as a militant gave a warning that his fate depended on President Obama's next move. The US has launched more than 120 air strikes in Iraq in the last month, in an attempt to help Kurdish forces curb the advance of Islamic State militants and protect minorities threatened by them.
They were reportedly caught as they were leaving the northern town of Arlit before dawn in five different vehicles. The migrants - mainly men, with some women and a few children - are believed to be from Nigeria and Niger. It comes days after 92 migrants were found to have died of thirst after two trucks broke down carrying them across the Sahara to Algeria. Niger lies on a major migrant route between sub-Saharan Africa and Europe. Those arrested on Saturday are now reportedly being arrested by police in Arlit. 'Criminal activities' The government announced on Friday a plan to close illegal camps in northern Niger - which it referred to as "ghettos" - and said those involved in trafficking migrants would be "severely punished". The country has been holding three days of mourning after the bodies of 52 children, 33 women and seven men were discovered on Wednesday. Another five from the same convoy had been found several days earlier by the army. Most of the dead were from the southern Niger district of Kantche. The government said in its statement on Friday that the tragedy was "the result of criminal activities led by all types of trafficking networks". About 5,000 African migrants are said to be currently stranded in illegal camps in the northern town of Agadez alone. Most of these migrants - having paid large sums of money to traffickers - are waiting to cross the hundreds of kilometres of desert into Libya or Algeria, from where they can take boats to Europe in the hope of a better life there. Niger has said that migrants found to be in the illegal camps will be handed over to international aid agencies. The head of the International Office for Migration in Niger, Abibatou Wane, has welcomed the action by the government but warned migrants should only be repatriated to their home countries on a voluntary basis.

The Islamic State (IS) militant with an English accent appears in the extremist group's video of the killing of American journalist James Foley. "I do know from my colleagues at home that we are close," Peter Westmacott told CNN's State of the Union show. The Foreign Office and Home Office refused to comment on the remarks. "We do not comment on security matters," an FCO spokesman said. 'Sophisticated technologies' Mr Westmacott said: "We're not far away from that [finding Foley's killer]. We're putting a lot into it." He added that some "very sophisticated" voice recognition technology was being used in the hunt, which is being led by the FBI. "I can't say more than this at the moment, but I do know from my colleagues at home that we are close," he added. Earlier this month, extremist group IS published a video of the moments before and after the apparent beheading of Mr Foley, 40, who was seized in Syria in 2012. Referring to the 500-plus British citizens who are thought to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to fight in the past few years, Mr Westmacott said: "It goes beyond one horrendous criminal... It's a betrayal of all our values." His comments come after Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond wrote in the Sunday Times that the government was investing "significant resources" to tackle "a barbaric ideology". Mr Hammond also warned the threat from conflicts in Syria and Iraq could last a generation. Downing Street earlier announced the appointment of a new security envoy to Iraq. Lt Gen Sir Simon Mayall, the government's senior defence advisor for the Middle East, will travel to the country next week to meet political leaders. Work is also under way to supply "non-lethal equipment" to Kurdish forces who are battling IS, including night vision equipment and body armour, a No 10 spokesman added. Domestic threat Home Secretary Theresa May has said the government is looking at new powers to tackle the threat of extremism in Britain. But shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called for a stronger domestic response. "More must be done to stop British citizens joining the barbarism and to keep the country safe if they return," she wrote in the Sunday Times. She called for more action "to disrupt the travel plans of those planning go out to fight through better monitoring of the borders' watch list as well as access to passports". The Home Office insisted it would take the "strongest possible action" against people travelling to fight in Iraq and Syria. A spokesman said: "The police, security services and Border Force are actively working to identify, detect and disrupt terrorist threats, including from British fighters attempting to return to the UK. "They use a wide range of powers including those which allow them to detain and interview individuals at the UK border suspected of being involved in terrorism." Senior Conservative MP David Davis, meanwhile, said TPims - used to restrict movement, the use of computers and mobile phones and meetings with others - were "completely useless". "What happens with them is that all the dangerous villains get away - they leave the country, go off back to Pakistan or now to Iraq," he told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend. Who are Islamic State (IS)? Government forces in Iraq said on Sunday that they had defeated an attack - suspected to be by IS - on the country's largest oil refinery, killing several insurgents. The Baiji refinery in northern Iraq has been the site of several battles between government forces and militants over the past few months. Meanwhile, a car bomb killed at least seven people in the capital Baghdad.
The group reportedly includes former UK consulate worker Simon Cheng, well-known activist Nathan Law and US citizen Samuel Chu. They are wanted on suspicion of violating a new security law imposed in Hong Kong by Beijing, Chinese state TV reported, calling them "troublemakers". Hong Kong police declined to comment. The development comes after legislative elections scheduled for September were delayed for a year by Hong Kong's government on Friday. It said the move was necessary because of a spike in Covid-19 infections, but the opposition accused it of using the pandemic as a pretext. The White House said the move undermined democracy. Pro-democracy politicians had hoped to capitalise on anger in the Chinese territory about the new security law to win a majority in the Legislative Council (LegCo). Many in Hong Kong, a former British colony handed back to China in 1997, fear that unique freedoms meant to be guaranteed until 2047 are under serious threat. The UK and Australia are among countries that have suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong in recent weeks. Germany did so on Friday - one of those reported to be on the new "wanted list" has received asylum there. Who are the 'wanted'? Chinese state TV network CCTV said six people were wanted on suspicion of inciting secession or colluding with foreign forces - both crimes can be punished with up to life in prison under the new security law. The six, according to CCTV and Hong Kong media, are: Simon Cheng, a former employee of the UK's Hong Kong consulate who was recently granted political asylum in Britain. He was detained last August while on a business trip to mainland China and accused of inciting political unrest in Hong Kong. He denies that and says he was beaten and forced to sign false confessions while in Chinese custody. Responding to news of the arrest warrant, Mr Cheng told the BBC that he would not stop speaking out about issues in Hong Kong. "The totalitarian regime now criminalises me, and I would take that not as a shame but an honour," he said. Nathan Law, 27, a high-profile activist who has fled to the UK. "I have no idea what is my 'crime' and I don't think that's important. Perhaps I love Hong Kong too much," he said on Twitter. Mr Law first came to prominence as a student protest leader in 2014. He said he was disappointed and frightened to have to live in exile, and that he was going to have to "sever" his relationship with his family in Hong Kong. Samuel Chu, a US citizen. He is the son of Reverend Chu Yiu Ming, a Baptist minister who was one of the founders of the 2014 "Umbrella Movement". Mr Chu runs the Washington DC-based Hong Kong Democracy Council and said he last visited Hong Kong in November 2019. "I might be the first non-Chinese citizen to be targeted, but I will not be the last. If I am targeted, any American and any citizen of any nation who speaks out for Hong Kong can, and will be, too," he said. The national security law carries extraterritorial provisions that say anyone, including non-Hong Kong residents, can be charged under it. China says the law is necessary to restore stability and order in the global financial hub. Ray Wong, a pro-independence activist who fled to Germany in 2017 and is now in Britain, told the BBC that the list of "wanted" exiles had been drawn up to "intimidate" pro-democracy activists who are trying to drum up international support for their cause. Honcques Laus, an 18-year-old now in the UK, first came to prominence in November 2017 when he brandished a pro-independence banner next to Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam. "Come arrest me in the UK," he was quoted - as Lau Hong - as telling a journalist on Friday. Wayne Chan, another pro-independence activist, is in an undisclosed country. "For me, the situation faced by Hong Kongers is even more dangerous than what I face. I can't think too much about my personal safety," he told Reuters news agency.
The leak happened during a report on state-run Channel One about President Vladimir Putin meeting military chiefs in the city of Sochi. One general was seen studying a diagram of the "devastating" torpedo system. Launched by a submarine, it would create "wide areas of radioactive contamination", the document says. The "oceanic multi-purpose Status-6 system" is designed to "destroy important economic installations of the enemy in coastal areas and cause guaranteed devastating damage to the country's territory by creating wide areas of radioactive contamination, rendering them unusable for military, economic or other activity for a long time", the document says. "It's true some secret data got into the shot, therefore it was subsequently deleted," said Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov. "In future we will undoubtedly take preventive measures so this does not happen again." The US Defence Department said it had seen the report, but would not comment further. "We are aware of the video footage, but defer to the Russian navy as to its authenticity," a Pentagon spokesperson told the BBC. However, the Russian government newspaper Rossiiskaya Gazeta later reported details of the weapon, without showing the diagram, and speculated about a super-radioactive cobalt device. So the leak may not have been accidental. Cobalt warhead? On the diagram the giant torpedo's range is given as "up to 10,000km" (6,200 miles) and depth of trajectory is "up to 1,000m" (3,300ft). It was developed by Rubin, a submarine design bureau in St Petersburg. It would, apparently, be launched by nuclear-powered submarines of the 09852 "Belgorod" and 09851 "Khabarovsk" series. Rossiiskaya Gazeta called the torpedo a "robotic mini-submarine", travelling at 100 knots (185km/h; 115mph), which would "avoid all acoustic tracking devices and other traps". Just before the torpedo diagram came into view in the state TV report, Mr Putin could be heard telling the generals that the US and its Nato allies were forging ahead with a global anti-missile defence system "unfortunately ignoring our concerns and our offers of co-operation". He said the Western defence project was "an attempt to undermine the existing parity in strategic nuclear weapons and essentially to upset the whole system of global and regional stability". In June Mr Putin said Russia would put more than 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles into service this year. US 'real goal' The US is developing the sea-based Aegis Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) system to counter the perceived threat of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles from Iran or another so-called "rogue" state. Under the plan, air defence missiles will eventually be sited on land in Romania and Poland. Mr Putin dismissed that Nato argument, pointing to the international deal, agreed this year, imposing limits on Iran's nuclear programme. "References to an Iranian or North Korean nuclear missile threat are just used to conceal the true plans - their real goal is to neutralise the strategic nuclear potential of other nuclear states... above all, of course, Russia," Mr Putin told the generals in Sochi, a Black Sea resort. He said Russia would continue developing strategic offensive systems capable of penetrating any anti-missile defence. According to state-run Rossiiskaya Gazeta, the destructive power attributed to the new torpedo's warhead would fit the description of a cobalt bomb. That would be a type of thermonuclear warhead with a layer of cobalt-59, which on detonation would be transmuted into highly radioactive cobalt-60 with a half-life longer than five years. Such a weapon would guarantee "that everything living will be killed", the paper said - there would not even be any survivors in bunkers. A cobalt bomb has never been tested because of the devastating radiation it would unleash. "But it can be considered as a means of deterrence - like the Perimetr system, which is on combat readiness, which guarantees retaliation with all of Russia's nuclear forces even if command posts and the country's leadership have been annihilated". Russian military experts told BBC Russian Service:
By Katherine SellgrenBBC News education reporter It shows a rise in satisfaction levels since 2005, especially in areas such as academic support and assessment. The Higher Education Funding Council for England analysed the results of the annual National Student Survey of more than 2m final-year UK students. It shows overall satisfaction levels have risen by five percentage points, from 80.2% in 2005 to 85% in 2013. Feedback Satisfaction with "assessment and feedback" rose by 12 percentage points during this period, as did happiness with "academic support". The results show differences depending on the subject a student chose, with students in creative art and design, computer science and mass communication and documentation less satisfied over time. Among the more satisfied were those studying veterinary sciences, physical sciences, mathematical sciences and geographical studies. The study also found that black African students were more satisfied overall than white students, but those from a black Caribbean background were less content. The analysis covers the core population of students who have been part of the National Student Survey cohort since 2005 - those registered at English, Welsh and Northern Irish universities who are not funded by the National Health Service. 'Source of intelligence' Hefce chief executive, Prof Madeleine Atkins, said: "The NSS is an invaluable source of intelligence for universities and colleges. "The reports we are publishing today confirm the robustness of the NSS, and the value it adds to UK higher education. Hefce will now work with the other UK funding bodies, universities and colleges, and students, to make refinements for the future." A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "We welcome this research on the NSS, which shows that students have become more satisfied with their higher education experience. "However, we are not complacent and are looking for institutions to analyse the data published today to improve the learning experience they offer to all students." Sally Hunt, general secretary of the University and College Union, said: "Despite unpopular and chaotic university funding changes from governments in the past nine years, students remain satisfied with their degrees and it is the staff in our universities who deserve enormous credit for that. "Satisfaction remains high even though staff pay has been driven down, workloads have increased and some students expect more for their massively increased fees - despite the fact that money merely covers the funding this government has cut. "The government and universities cannot continue to simply expect more for less. We need proper investment and commitment to higher education if we are to continue to satisfy students in our universities and be a key player on the world stage."
The jewels were initially thought to have been loaned to stars at the annual film festival on the French Riviera. They were taken from the hotel room of an employee of exclusive Swiss jewellers Chopard in the early hours of Friday morning. Police say the thieves ripped the safe containing the jewels from a wall of the room at the Novotel hotel. But a company spokeswoman, Raffaella Rossiello, insisted the value of the pieces had been exaggerated and "the jewellery stolen is not part of the collection... worn by actresses during the Cannes Film Festival". And festival officials said the event's top award, the Palme d'Or, was not among the stolen items. The trophy is also made by Chopard, an official sponsor of the festival. Celebrities choosing the Swiss firm's gems for their red carpet appearances at this year's festival include Julianne Moore, Lana Del Rey and Cindy Crawford. The theft happened a few hours after the festival was shown The Bling Ring, a new film by director Sofia Coppola. The film is about teenagers who find out when celebrities are attending red carpet events in order to break into their homes and steal their designer clothes, bags and shoes.
Maamoun Abdul Karim said they included the Tower of Elahbel, built in AD103 and one of the best-preserved. The multi-storey sandstone monuments, standing outside the city walls in an area known as the Valley of the Tombs, belonged to rich Palmyrene families. Their demolition comes only days after IS blew up Palmyra's two main temples. The group, which captured the Unesco World Heritage site from government forces in May, has previously destroyed two Islamic shrines - those of a Shia saint and Sufi scholar - near Palmyra, which they described as "manifestations of polytheism". Satellite images The Valley of the Tombs, in the hills to the south and west of the ruins of the Greco-Roman city, contains a series of funerary towers of various sizes. The towers were divided into compartments, or loculi, into which sarcophagi were placed before being sealed with slabs of stone carved with an image of the deceased and painted in lively colours. Ancient city of Palmyra IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' History's lesson in how to save artefacts Understanding sadness at loss of sites Why IS destroys ancient sites The Tower of Elahbel was among the most prominent. It was four storeys high and could purportedly accommodate up to 300 sarcophagi. Mr Abdul Karim told the AFP news agency that he had received reports 10 days ago that the "best preserved and most beautiful" towers had been blown up, but only just confirmed the news. "We obtained satellite images from the US-based Syrian Heritage Initiative, taken on 2 September," he added. On Tuesday, satellite images confirmed reports that IS had destroyed the Temple of Bel, which the UN Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) said was one of the most important religious edifices of the 1st Century in the East. Last month, the jihadist group blew up the smaller Temple of Baalshamin and beheaded the archaeologist who looked after the site for four decades, Khaled al-Asaad, after he reportedly refused to reveal where treasures had been hidden. Unesco's director-general Irina Bokova has said the systematic destruction of Palmyra constitutes a "war crime" and called on the international community to stand united against IS efforts to "deprive the Syrian people of its knowledge, its identity and history". IS has ransacked and demolished several similar ancient sites that pre-date Islam in Iraq. The sale of looted antiquities is nevertheless one of the group's main sources of funding. It has also been accused of destroying ancient sites to gain publicity. The Syrian authorities removed hundreds of statues and priceless objects before IS overran Palmyra, among them the carved images found in the funerary towers.
By Paula McGrathHealth check, BBC World Service How to fix it When we think, move, speak, dream and even love - it all happens in the grey matter. But our brains are not simply one colour. White matter matters too. Much of the research into dementia has focused on the tell-tale plaques of beta amyloid and tau protein tangles which occur in the grey matter. But one British scientist, Dr Atticus Hainsworth says the white matter - and its blood supply - may be equally important. The white colour results from fatty sheaths around the axons - which are extensions of the nerve cell bodies and help the cells to communicate. He is using banks of donated brains, in Oxford and Sheffield, to analyse white matter for potential triggers such as leaking blood vessels. "Some of the cases had an MRI or CT scan and that information can help give more clues about whether there was disease in the white matter - and what its basis might be," says Dr Hainsworth. If leaking blood vessels in white matter do play a key role in the development of dementia then it may offer up a another potential route for new drug therapies. How to make us all geniuses For years caffeine was used to enhance alertness. But popping a pill to get straight-A's may soon become the norm. At Cambridge University neuroscientist Barbara Sahakian is investigating cognitive enhancers - drugs which make us smarter. She studies how they can improve the performance of surgeons or pilots and asks if they could even be used to make us more entrepreneurial. But she warns that there is no long-term safety information on these drugs and as a society we need to talk about their use. She says the scientific and ethical challenges created by drugs which affect the production of brain chemicals like dopamine and noradrenaline - which induce pleasurable or "fight or flight" responses - need to be debated in order to decide whether drug-tests become routine before taking an exam. Dr Sahakian adds: "I frequently talk to students about cognitive-enhancing drugs and a lot of students take them for studying and exams. "But other students feel angry about this, they feel those students are cheating." How can we harness our unconscious? People need to be on top of their game when mastering skills like playing a musical instrument or detecting a bomb. But research suggests that our unconscious can be harnessed to help us excel. Repeatedly playing a tricky piece of music obviously helps develop a familiarity with the bits that are most difficult. But cellist Tania Lisboa, who's also a researcher in the Centre for Performance Science at London's Royal College of Music, says it also helps to send the trickier parts of a piece from her conscious to the unconscious part of her brain. After hours of practice, a fluent musician's brain stores how to play the piece in an area at the back of the brain called the cerebellum - literally "the little brain". Neuroscientist Prof Anil Seth, of Sussex University, says: "It has more brain cells than the rest of the brain put together. "It helps to promote fluid movements.. So the conscious effort of learning how to bow a cello is moved from the cortical areas which are involved when it's new or difficult over to the cerebellum, which is very good at producing unconscious fluent behaviour on demand." Music and defence may not appear to have much in common, but the unconscious can also help detect potential threats, whether it's a suspicious person in a crowd or the presence of an improvised explosive device. The unconscious brain is really good at spotting patterns - a skill which Paul Sajda at Colombia University in New York exploits - right at the boundary of the conscious/sub-conscious. "I can flash 10 images a second and if one of those images has something out of the ordinary..that will essentially cause me to re-orient my brain to that image - but I'm not exactly aware of what that is." Brain activity is monitored whilst the analyst looks at images so that researchers can later see which images triggered reactions. What dreams are for It's just 60 years since scientists in Chicago first noted the tell-tale "rapid eye movement" or REM sleep which we now associate with dreaming. But our fascination with dreams dates back at least 5,000 years to ancient Mesopotamia when people believed that the soul moved out of a sleeping body to visit the places they dreamed of. REM sleep - which occurs every 90 minutes or so - begins with signals from the base of the brain which eventually reach the cerebral cortex - the outer layer of the brain which is responsible for learning and thought. These nerve impulses are also directed to the spinal cord, inducing temporary paralysis of the limbs. Prof Robert Stickgold, from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for Sleep and Cognition in Boston, believes that dreams are vital for processing memory associations. He has asked the subjects of some of his sleep studies to play Tetris - and then noted their descriptions of how they floated amongst geometric shapes in their dreams. He's an admirer of Japanese scanning research where the scientists could "read" the dreams of subjects as they had MRI scans. But he says it's hard to get people to sleep in a noisy, expensive scanner. And the future? "I would like to see research which reveals the rules for dream construction - and how it relates to the larger concept of memory processing during sleep." One even more elusive goal: how to dream just happy dreams and ditch the bad ones, especially nightmares. Can we cure unreachable pain? Excruciating chronic pain is one of medicine's most difficult problems to solve. Untouched by conventional treatments like painkilling drugs, surgeons are now testing their theory that deep brain stimulation could provide relief. It is a brain surgery technique which involves electrodes being inserted to reach targets deep inside the brain. The target areas are stimulated via the electrodes which are connected to a battery-powered pacemaker surgically placed under the patient's collar bone. One of the pioneers of this technique is Prof Tipu Aziz at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Deep brain stimulation has been used in the past for Parkinson's disease and depression, and is now being trialled on obsessive compulsive disorder patients as well as those in chronic pain. One of his patients, Clive, has suffered from terrible pain for nearly a decade after an operation to remove a disc in his neck. "Sometimes I thought that if I had an axe, I'd chop my own arm off, if I thought it would get rid of the pain." The doctors explained to him that his brain was getting signals from his arm to his brain confused and that the electrodes could help. In Clive's case this was an area of the brain called the anterior cingulate. A week after his surgery he was one of the fortunate 70% of patients for whom the deep brain stimulation provides relief. "It's great to be out of that pain now. Since having the implant I can sit down for longer, I am able to walk further, everything is an improvement." Prof Aziz is treating medical conditions. But he is aware of ethical dilemmas which could arise if the technique was applied to other areas. "Putting electrodes in targets to improve memory. "Or you could put electrodes into people to make them indifferent to danger and create the perfect soldier."
S&P said the cut from AA+ to AA came after reassessment "of cohesion within the EU, which we now consider to be a neutral rather than positive". The UK's Brexit vote had triggered "greater uncertainty" over long term economic and financial planning. On Monday, S&P cut the UK's top AAA credit rating, saying Brexit could hit the economy and financial sector. S&P said the change to its EU rating was because the previous assessment was based on all 28 states remaining in the bloc. The agency said: "The rating action stems from S&P Global Ratings' view that the UK government's declared intention to leave the union lessens the supranational's fiscal flexibility, while reflecting weakening political cohesion. "Our baseline scenario was previously that all 28 member states would remain inside the EU. While we expect the remaining 27 members to reaffirm their commitment to the union, we think the UK's departure will inevitably require new and complicated negotiations on the next seven-year budgetary framework. "Going forward, revenue forecasting, long-term capital planning, and adjustments to key financial buffers of the EU will in our view be subject to greater uncertainty," S&P said. Pound falls on hint of Bank stimulus Agencies downgrade UK credit rating How will Brexit affect your finances? On Monday, S&P stripped Britain of its top credit grade by two notches, from AAA to AA, warning the Brexit vote would lead to "a less predictable, stable and effective policy framework in the UK". A number of economists have warned about the consequences of leaving the EU, with IHS Global Insight cutting its growth forecasts to 1.5% from 2% for 2016 and to 0.2% from 2.4% for 2017. Also on Thursday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney signalled that interest rates could be cut over the summer to help boost the UK economy. He said "some monetary policy easing" would be required in response to the Brexit vote.
By Natalie ShermanBusiness reporter, New York The lawsuits are one of the most significant legal actions the US government has taken against the firm. Officials are asking the court to consider breaking up the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook said the deals under scrutiny were approved by regulators years ago. "The government now wants a do-over, sending a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final," Facebook general counsel Jennifer Newstead said. She said the company had invested millions to make Instagram and WhatsApp successful and would defend itself "vigorously". "Antitrust laws exist to protect consumers and promote innovation, not to punish successful businesses," Facebook said, describing the government's arguments as "revisionist history". The lawsuits filed by the states and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) focus on Facebook's 2012 acquisition of Instagram, 2014 purchase of WhatsApp and rules governing outside software developers. Officials accused Facebook of taking a "buy or bury" approach to potential rivals, hurting competitors and users, who have lost control of their own data to support the firm's advertising revenue. The legal filings cite internal messages from Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg, such as one 2008 email that said it was "better to buy than compete". "For nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users," said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the legal fight by the states. "No company should have this much unchecked power over our personal interaction and social interactions. That's why we are taking action today." It's quite hard sometimes to comprehend just how massive Facebook is. Facebook, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram - all owned by Facebook - all have more than a billion monthly users. WhatsApp and Facebook have more than two billion. What the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is arguing is that there's a reason why Facebook came to dominate this highly lucrative sector - it acquired the competition illegally. In 2012 Instagram was growing rapidly. Facebook was worried. Zuckerberg has admitted himself previously that Instagram was a competitor to Facebook. It was bought, for what now seems a ludicrously low figure of $1bn. WhatsApp too in 2014 was growing at incredible speeds. Was it going to threaten Facebook's own messenger service? Facebook bought WhatsApp too. Both of these acquisitions were previously looked at by the FTC and were approved. That is Facebook's argument - that they bought these companies when they were much smaller - that there was nothing pre-ordained about their success. In other words, don't punish Facebook for building strong American companies. Whether Instagram and WhatsApp will be cleaved off from Facebook will now be decided in the courts - and these antitrust lawsuits take time. There will also be ample opportunity for appeals. Don't expect a breakup of Facebook soon. But this is yet more indication of where the courts and politicians are now headed. Big Tech is a little too big in many peoples' eyes - and it needs to cutting down to size. Monopoly claims The lawsuits come as US regulators are taking a closer look at the power enjoyed by tech companies. This summer, the bosses of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple were forced to testify before Congress, as part of a bigger investigation of their influence on the market. In October, the Department of Justice sued Google, accusing the search giant of violating US competition laws to maintain a monopoly on internet searches and online advertising. More than 2.5 billion people use one of Facebook's apps each day. The firm, valued at nearly $800bn, employs more than 56,000 people and reported more than $18bn in profit last year. The Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank that has been pushing regulators to take a more aggressive stance against tech companies, said the lawsuits were a "critical step" forward. "There's still more to do, but this is a big moment," the organisation wrote on Twitter. You may also be interested in:
The man, identified by French media as Gregoire Moutaux, 25, was arrested on the Ukrainian border with Poland. Intelligence chief Vasyl Hrytsak said the man had planned 15 attacks and was driven by ultra-nationalist views. He had amassed guns, detonators and 125kg of TNT, Mr Hrytsak said. Mr Hrytsak listed bridges, motorways, a mosque and a synagogue among the suspect's potential targets. He was being prosecuted for arms smuggling and terrorism, he said. It was not clear if the tournament itself was being targeted and Paris police prefect Michel Cadot told reporters there was "no specific threat against any [Euro 2016] site". 'Threat exists' News of the man's arrest on 21 May first emerged in a report by French TV network M6. The suspect was described as a worker at a farming co-operative from the Lorraine area of eastern France. He had no previous criminal record, reports said. French authorities have been on high security alert ahead of the European championships, amid fears that the tournament could be targeted by Islamist militants. President Francois Hollande said on Sunday that "the threat exists" but that France should not be daunted. Analysis - by BBC Paris correspondent Hugh Schofield The French police and judicial authorities are saying very little about Gregoire Moutaux. They clearly want to know more from the Ukrainians before they pronounce on any possible terrorist link. What's significant is that so far the French investigation is not in the hands of anti-terrorist specialists, but of the unit that looks into organised crime. This would suggest that the initial suspicion in Paris is that Mr Moutaux was engaged in arms trafficking. His home in north-east France has been searched by police, who - according to media reports - found a T-shirt bearing far-right insignia. The Ukrainians say he was motivated by hatred of immigration and globalisation. Ukraine's SBU security service said it had been watching the suspect since December last year and that he had picked up five Kalashnikovs, two anti-tank grenade launchers, some 5,000 rounds of ammunition and 100 detonators, as well as a large quantity of explosives. An SBU video was shown of the dramatic moment of the suspect's arrest along with the weapons that intelligence officials said they had found. The arrest was said to have taken place at a border crossing close to the Ukrainian town of Yahodyn. The footage also revealed a second person being wrestled to the ground on the passenger side of the car. The SBU chief said the French suspect had been in touch "with military units fighting in Donbass", a reference to the eastern areas of Luhansk and Donetsk, where pro-Russian rebels have seized large areas of Ukrainian territory. "The Frenchman spoke negatively of the activities of his government on mass migration of foreigners to France, the spread of Islam and globalisation. He also said he wished to stage a number of terrorist attacks in protest," Mr Hrytsak said. Euro 2016 security France's 10 Euro 2016 stadiums Euro 2016 - Uefa website A search was carried out at the suspect's home in the tiny village of Nant-le-Petit and police sources told French media that explosive material and balaclavas were recovered. An inquiry has been launched by France's organised crime agency, OCLCO, and by regional authorities in Nancy. However, French police sources told AFP news agency that Ukrainian officials had yet to send them any details. There was some scepticism that the suspect could have been anything more than an arms trafficker. Residents in Nant-le-Petit were stunned by the arrest of Gregoire Moutaux, who lives there with his grandfather and works as a cattle inseminator. "He's a rather nice guy, who I think is actually rather well-educated. I've even invited him over for a glass of wine. I just can't understand this," neighbour Jean-Jacques Renck told France 3 TV. Anti-terrorism specialist Alain Bauer said Ukraine had become a big source of arms because of the continuing conflict in the east of the country. The man detained did not fit the usual profile of an attacker, he said, pointing to the arrest last year of far-right activist Claude Hermant, accused of providing weapons to a jihadist who murdered four people at a Jewish supermarket in Paris in January 2015.
Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter The report, issued by the National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of GCHQ, says it can provide "only limited assurance that the long-term security risks can be managed in the Huawei equipment currently deployed in the UK". The report reflects what are said to be deep frustrations at the failure of the company to address previously identified problems. Huawei supplies telecoms for telecoms companies operating in the UK and this report comes ahead of a decision by the UK over whether to allow the company to build next generation 5G networks. Poor practices The US has been campaigning for it to be excluded on the basis the company poses a national security risk. There is no allegation in the latest report that the company is deliberately introducing backdoors or working to carry out any kind of espionage on behalf of the Chinese state. Rather, the accusation is that poor practices by the company create vulnerabilities that in turn pose security risks. The report describes "significant technical issues in Huawei's engineering processes". It also says Huawei's approach to software development brings "significantly increased risk to UK operators". Officials say the rigorous system of oversight means those risks can be mitigated and managed. But the report also warns that the current arrangement "can only provide limited assurance that all risks to UK national security from Huawei's involvement in the UK's critical networks can be sufficiently mitigated long-term". Huawei's kit is often cheaper than that of rivals but with that come concerns that the business model driving its fast growth can lead to sloppiness in its work. And because the company offers different products to different customers, it has been hard for security officials to be able to confirm that the equipment is all secured to the same standard. Since 2010, after Huawei partnered first with BT and then other telecoms providers to supply equipment in the UK's telecoms infrastructure, the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC), known as "the cell", has been examining the hardware and software deployed. In 2014, a board, chaired by National Cyber Security Centre head Ciaran Martin, was set up to oversee its work. Other government representatives as well as individuals from Huawei and companies that use Huawei equipment also sit on the oversight board. Concerns were raised in last year's annual report but this year its report is highly critical of the failure of the company to address these. Huawei has said it will invest significant sums in dealing with the problems in the next three to five years but it is understood that so far officials have not seen what they consider to be a credible plan to do so. "No material progress has been made by Huawei in the remediation of the issues reported last year," the report says. This raises concerns for the future, according to the oversight board. "It will be difficult to appropriately risk manage future products in the context of UK deployments, until Huawei's software engineering and cyber-security processes are remediated," it says. "The oversight board currently had not seen anything to give it confidence in Huawei's ability to bring about change via its transformation programme." The report stresses that the decision over Huawei's role in 5G will come after a wider review by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). But its warnings raise serious questions as to whether a company whose work on existing systems has proved so problematic should be allowed to play a major role in building the next generation of systems on which significant parts of our daily life will eventually depend. In response, a Huawei representative said it understood the concerns over its software engineering capability and took them "very seriously". They added:
BTCC said it would stop buying and selling on 30 September in response to tightening regulation. It comes after authorities banned initial coin offerings on 5 September. The country has seen an explosion of digital currency trading, sparking fears about the financial risks and speculative investing. The price of Bitcoin tumbled sharply following the BTCC announcement late on Thursday but has since regained some ground. Cracking down Chinese authorities expressed concern over the investment risks involved in crypto-currencies and ordered a ban on initial coin offerings, or ICOs, earlier this month. A growing number of tech companies are opting to sell digital "tokens" to raise funds because they are quick, easy and unregulated. Then on Wednesday this week, the state-backed National Internet Finance Association issued a warning that virtual currencies are increasingly being used as a tool for illegal fundraising and money laundering. BTCC, one of the world's biggest Bitcoin platforms, said in a tweet Thursday after "carefully considering" the directive from regulators, trading on its platform would cease and it would stop registering new users from Thursday. BTCC also runs an international exchange from Hong Kong. More intervention is expected. The BTCC shutdown comes ahead of speculation that the Chinese government plans to completely ban exchanges. Reuters and other media have reported this week, citing sources, that China is planning the suspension, but the regulator has not yet made any such announcement. China's ICO ban, and wider fears of more regulation, has prompted a sell-off that has wiped billions of the value of crypto-currencies since they hit record highs at the start of the month. Currency risk Regulators around the world are in the midst of working out how to address some of the risks around virtual currencies. The UK's financial watchdog warned this week that ICOs are "very high-risk, speculative investments," while the US Securities and Exchange Commission said in July that some ICOs should be regulated like other stocks. Regulators in Singapore, Hong Kong and Canada have also pointed out some of the dangers. Digital currencies are also facing scrutiny from the private sector. This week JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon branded Bitcoin a "fraud" and said it was set to "blow up". Mr Dimon told an investor conference in New York that if any of his traders were found trading Bitcoin he would "fire them in a second", and that Bitcoin was "worse than tulips bulbs", referring to a famous market bubble from the 1600s.
A report by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Aviation said efforts should be made "to ensure the UK retains and grows hub capacity" at Heathrow or a new purpose-built hub airport. It comes as the government rejected calls for a third runway at Heathrow. Chancellor George Osborne said the government understood there was a need for additional airport capacity. On Tuesday, Transport Secretary Justine Greening said the government remained opposed to a third runway at Heathrow, despite calls from Conservative MPs for a change of heart. The coalition agreement between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats rules out any expansion of Heathrow before the next election, while Labour also currently opposes the idea of a third runway at the UK's largest airport. 'Trading nation' But a consultation on future air capacity in south-east England has twice been delayed amid reported divisions within the coalition and Conservative ranks. The chancellor said more airport capacity was needed in the south east but exactly where "is not a decision you can make right here, right now". "Over the next few months we will be talking to people about where that capacity should be," Mr Osborne said. "I am very clear; we are an open trading nation and just as we don't want to shut down our ports or our railways, we don't want to shut down our airpsace." The All Party Aviation Group, which brings together MPs from across the parties with an interest in aviation but has no formal parliamentary role, said the UK was being left behind on aviation capacity. It has taken evidence from 60 organisations and its chair, Labour MP Brian Donohoe said the findings "advocate a new direction for UK aviation". He said: "In order to achieve the greatest possible economic and social contribution from aviation, we need two things from government: a forward-looking aviation policy that allows for aviation growth; and a new approach to the taxation of aviation. "Combined, a new approach could not only energise the sector but also provide a firm foundation for the UK's economic recovery. "In common with all other sectors, aviation must continue to address its carbon emissions and environmental impacts. It has already achieved significant improvements but can and must do more." The group, which received advice and administrative assistance from the Fair Tax on Flying campaign - an alliance of more than 30 travel organisations who think tax on air passengers is too high - said Airport Passenger Duty is "a barrier to inward business". The government should undertake an economic analysis of the impact of the tax "on growth and employment," the MPs said. A government spokesman said: "The UK is currently one of the best-connected countries in the world, but does face a capacity challenge in the medium term, especially in south east England. "It is this challenge that government will seek to address in its call for evidence later this year." He added: "The government is firmly committed to ensuring aviation in the UK remains affordable and will continue to monitor the situation to ensure the industry is able to compete in international markets."
By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter The actress, who stars in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, also said female characters in films should not have to be portrayed as physically tough in order to be considered strong. "I think that, so often, when a story's told which says 'this is a strong woman', she has to beat the man, or she has to be like the man, or she has to somehow not need the man," Jolie told journalists at the film's launch. Referring to her own character in the film and Princess Aurora, played by Elle Fanning, Jolie said: "We both very much need and love and learn from the men. "And so I think that's also an important message for young girls, to find their own power, but to respect and learn from the men around them." She added: "We have strong women, but the character that is wrong in the film and has to be taken out is also a woman. We show very diverse types of women between our characters, but also we have extraordinary men in the film, and I really want to press that point." Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, the sequel to 2014's Maleficent, is released in the UK later this month and also stars Ed Skrein, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michelle Pfeiffer. Fanning, who reprises her role of Princess Aurora in the film, echoed Jolie's comments and said her character's strength is not necessarily physical, unlike many princesses in children's films. "Aurora's strength is her kindness, and she stays very true to herself, which is something I wanted to keep in the film. She is soft and feminine and wants to be a wife and have babies, and that's a beautiful, strong thing that isn't portrayed a lot on screen. "A lot of the princesses are like 'we're gonna make her a strong princess! And make her tough, so we're gonna make her fight!' And it's like, is that what being a strong woman means? Like, we just have to have a sword and have armour on and go fight? Aurora can do that in a different way, in a pink dress, and it's beautiful that she keeps her softness and vulnerabilities." 'How to use that power' Many of the female leads in action or children's films focus on the character's physical strength. Wonder Woman, for example, or Merida in the Disney's 2012 film Brave. Indeed, one of Jolie's previous roles was playing action hero Lara Croft in Tomb Raider. Explaining the premise of the Maleficent sequel, Fanning said: "Five years have passed in her life, and she's now Queen of the Moors, and she has this new responsibility, and she's trying to figure out who she is as a ruler and how to use that power." The movie's plot sees Jolie's Maleficent conflicted over her maternal feelings towards Aurora, and facing competition from the neighbouring Queen Ingrith (played by Michelle Pfeiffer). Queen Ingrith causes a rift between Maleficent and Aurora, when her son Prince Phillip proposes to the princess. Ingrith intends to use the marriage to divide humans and fairies, and it falls to Maleficent to stop the impending war. Official reviews are still under embargo, but critics who attended early screenings of the film have been allowed to share their first impressions on Twitter. "Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is like Pirates of the Caribbean; there's lots of convolution and contrivance, but has star power," said Courtney Howard, who reviews films for Variety and Awards Circuit. "Angelina Jolie, Michelle Pfeiffer and Elle Fanning are a holy trinity with bumpy arcs." Scott Menzel, the editor of We Live Entertainment, described it as "a visually spectacular sequel that proves once again that Angelina Jolie was born to play the title character. [It's] a modern day fairytale where badass women take centre stage. The battle sequences are epic and the costumes are stunning." "Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer having a sass-off in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is every bit as good as you'd hope," said Digital Spy. "The movie needs more of it, but it's still a visually bold, fun and superior sequel." The film received its London premiere on Wednesday. Fanning said: "I definitely felt a real responsibility to do the second film, the first film was the first film I'd ever done of that scale, and so many young kids saw the film, and especially young girls would come up to me, and they'd look at me as the character. "So hearing that we'd be doing the sequel, I felt a responsibility to those girls for sure, and just to get to show Aurora as a young woman growing up. Obviously in the first film, I was 14 when I did that, and Aurora still has the qualities that she does of kindness, innocence and sweetness that she embodies, but it was so fun to come back. "The three of us [Fanning, Jolie and Pfeiffer], we were there in the beginning, our relationships have changed and grown, I'm 21 now, so I wasn't the kid on set anymore. I really felt accepted on set in a way. Especially with Michelle and Angelina, I felt like they included me as if I was one of their peers." Jolie says the films have come to reflect the life cycle of a woman - something that wasn't necessarily the intention when the first movie was conceived. "One of the interesting things is, without realising, we've hit the chapters of the growth of a woman," she said. "Her birth, her christening, to being a little girl, a teenage girl, to now being a wife. And so in a way the chapters are following a few things, but one of them is how a woman grows and evolves."

By Angela Harrison Education correspondent, BBC News Six of the author's books about wizardry feature in a list compiled by online education company Renaissance Learning. The Potter series has a reading age of 11-12, but is popular among children as young as six. Other books on the list were similarly advanced. The study looked at the reading habits of more than 400,000 children in 2,000 primary and secondary schools in the UK, with children being asked to vote for their favourites. The top books across all age groups were, in joint first place: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins. Fourth place was shared by Inheritance (Christopher Paolini) and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Branded products Eight books shared sixth place: Renaissance Learning calculates an estimated "reading age" for the Harry Potter books, launched in 1997, as being between 11 and 12 years old, based on the complexity of words and language and sentence length. But a breakdown of the lists suggests the books are very popular with younger readers. One of the Harry Potter titles is in second place on the most popular book list among pupils in Year 2 (six and seven-year-olds) and three are in the top five books picked by children in Year 3. The Hunger Games and Catching Fire - which were both made into successful films - have an estimated reading age 11, but appear popular with children from the age of nine or 10. Renaissance Learning says the fact that children are reading books which are quite challenging for their age group suggests films, computer games and branded products linked with books might be boosting literacy. It is not thought the final study, when it is published later this year, will show a causal link however. Prof Keith Topping from Dundee University, who carried out the research for the company, looked at what children of different ages were reading and how much they understood about those books. He said: "It is wonderful what reading highly motivating books does for children. "For the Years 1-5, children are reading favourite books at far above their chronological ability, but still maintaining a high rate of success." He said it was not just that films might attract children to reading books - a child might also be drawn to seeing a film if they had liked a book. Added value "The Hobbit was high on the lists before the first film came out," he said. "However, since the first film came out, The Hobbit has risen up the lists and become even more popular. So films certainly do give a book added value for children." Last year the Booktrust charity asked people of all ages to vote for the book they thought all children should read before the age of 14 from a list of 100. JK Rowling also topped that poll, followed by The Hunger Games and many others which had also been turned into films, including novels by Roald Dahl, Tolkien, CS Lewis and Philip Pullman. Viv Bird, the chief executive of Booktrust, said: "We're not surprised to see another list topped by Harry Potter. It's been several years since the last film was released, and many of these children weren't born 16 years ago when the first Potter title was published, yet it truly endures as a modern classic. "The common fear among parents and teachers is that books have to compete with the rest of the entertainment industry for children's attention, but we are seeing more and more of this trend for films sending young people back to books. "It can be a reciprocal relationship and actually help turn reluctant readers around, which can only be a good thing."
Here is what we know so far about the discovery: Who are the victims? Police say there were 59 men, eight women and four children in the lorry. Travel documents discovered among their belongings have led authorities to believe they were Syrian refugees. The condition of the victims' remains initially made it difficult to determine the number of dead. How did they die? They are believed to have suffocated in the back of the small lorry as it drove through Hungary, but were not discovered until about two days later. The lorry had no ventilation. How were they discovered? Police were alerted to the lorry when a road worker saw liquid seeping from the vehicle. It was abandoned on Austria's A4 motorway between Neusiedl and Parndorf. Has anyone been arrested? Three Bulgarian men have been detained in Hungary, suspected of driving the lorry. They are thought to have left the Hungarian capital, Budapest, for Austria on Wednesday morning. Police said they suspect the crime was part of a Bulgarian-Hungarian human trafficking operation. Who owns the lorry? The Slovakian poultry company, Hyza, whose logo appears on the lorry, says it no longer owned the vehicle but its branding was not removed. Hans Peter Doskozil, a provincial Austrian police chief, said it was a refrigerated vehicle, which is not a typical choice for people smugglers. Where is it now? Police towed the vehicle to a customs building with refrigeration facilities where forensic teams worked through the night to examine the bodies. Have you been affected by this story?

Nick TriggleHealth correspondent@nicktriggleon Twitter In the 1840s people did not live much past 40 on average. But then improvements in nutrition, hygiene, housing and sanitation during the Victorian period meant by the early 1900s life expectancy was approaching 60. As the 20th Century progressed, with the exception of the war years, further gains were made with the introduction of universal health care and childhood immunisations. From the 1970s onwards, medical advances in the care of stroke and heart attack patients in particular, saw big strides continue to be made So much so that by the start of the 21st Century, life expectancy at birth had reached 80 for women and 75 for men. And so it continued, with an extra year of life being added every four years or so. But then it suddenly stopped - or rather rapidly slowed. The turning point was 2011. A blip or long-term trend? Initially many experts wondered if it might be a blip. Certainly 2015 was an exceptional year when the number of deaths spiked - the winter was particularly bad, and this was linked to the strain of flu circulating. But it is now clear there is more to it than just a short aberration The latest figures released by the Office for National Statistics for 2016-2018 - these things are measured on a rolling three-year basis - are the first for a few years to exclude that bad winter. And while there has been a little improvement, it is still way down on what has been seen previously. On current trends, it will take more than 12 years for people living in the UK to gain an extra year of life. So what are the causes? One suggestion put forward is that after so many years of gains, humans are just reaching the upper limits of their lifespan. The oldest living person for whom official records exist was French woman Jeanne Calment, who was 122 when she died - but that was more than 20 years ago. Research published by the journal Nature has claimed the limit - bar those extreme few like Ms Calment - is around 115. But there are plenty who dispute this. In fact a US geneticist, David Sinclair, has written a book called Lifespan which argues that by boosting genes associated with longevity, people may be able to live much longer. Whatever the truth, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that the UK's population should not have reached its limit on lifespan. Japan, for example, which already has longer life expectancy, has seen bigger increases in recent years than the UK. In fact, out of the wealthier nations the ONS looked at, there was only one country which had a significantly worse record than the UK - the US - although plenty have seen improvements slow down. Complex range of factors ONS ageing expert Edward Morgan said there was likely to be a "complex" range of factors behind the trend - and he would like more work done to investigate it. Public Health England has already done some. Its report, published last year, puts forward a number of factors. One possible explanation is that there has not been a big medical or health game-changer in the past couple of decades. As people stop dying from one thing, another disease takes its place. With greater numbers surviving heart attacks and strokes and cancer, the death rate from dementia has started to rise. And with the medical community struggling to find ways to slow the disease - never mind cure it - life expectancy has been curbed. The PHE report also looked at the impact of austerity - something former World Health Organization adviser Prof Michael Marmot has already suggested is playing a role. The evidence shows that poorer people have seen the biggest decline in improvements - and the fact they would be more affected by a squeeze on care, health and welfare spending "could indicate" government spending has played a role, PHE said. But the report was far from being conclusive. What is sure, however, is that the longer this trend goes on, the more pressing it will become to find an answer.
In a statement, he said the two worst affected provinces, Leyte and Samar, had suffered massive destruction and loss of life. Thousands of survivors are still desperately waiting for the aid effort to reach them. At least 10,000 people are feared to have been killed. Tacloban is one of the worst affected cities. The BBC's Jon Donnison, who is there, says there does not yet seem to be an effective operation to get help to those in need. This is expected to change over the next few days, he says. Hundreds of thousands more people have been displaced after the high winds and floodwaters destroyed their homes. Damage to roads and airports has delayed the delivery of aid. The UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the UN would launch a large-scale humanitarian plan on Tuesday. He called for UN member states to show solidarity with the people of the Philippines. "We have all seen the heartbreaking images of the impact of this huge storm," he said. One of the most powerful storms on record to make landfall, Haiyan - named "Yolanda" by Philippine authorities - struck the coastal provinces of Leyte and Samar on Friday. It then headed west, sweeping through six central Philippine islands. Struggle More than nine million people have been affected in the Philippines. Many are now struggling to survive without food, shelter or clean drinking water. A picture is slowly emerging of the full damage wrought by the storm: A huge international relief effort is under way, but rescue workers have struggled to reach areas cut off since the storm. However, reports from Tacloban say soldiers have been distributing food and water to some residents and the US military has sent marines to the city. The head of the Philippine Red Cross, Richard Gordon, described the situation as "absolute bedlam". "It's only now that they were able to get in and we're beginning just to bring in the necessary food items... as well as water and other things that they need," he told the BBC. Jane Cocking, the humanitarian director for Oxfam, said her colleagues witnessed "complete devastation". A Philippine military spokesman was quoted as saying on Monday that 942 people had died in the typhoon's aftermath, though it is clear the official death toll will rise significantly. Some 660,000 people have been displaced, according to UN figures, among a total of 9.8 million affected. The UN's Under-Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs, Valerie Amos, was is her way to the Philippines. A priority of the UN's response teams once on the ground would be the burial of bodies to meet concerns about public health, UN humanitarian official John Ging said. "We are certainly expecting the worst," he added. "As we get more and more access we find the tragedy of more and more people killed in this typhoon." 'Unprecedented' storm Some are questioning what more authorities could have done to prepare for this, just the latest in a string of disasters to hit the nation of more than 7,000 islands. Authorities had evacuated hundreds of thousands of people before the typhoon arrived, but many evacuation centres - schools, churches and government buildings - proved unable to withstand the winds and storm surges. Haiyan brought sustained winds of 235km/h (147mph), with gusts of 275 km/h (170 mph) and waves as high as 15m (45ft). In some places, as much as 400mm (15.75 inches) of rain fell. Officials said looting was widespread and order was proving difficult to enforce. Correspondents say many ordinary people are simply scavenging for the food and water needed to survive. In some areas, the dead are being buried in mass graves. American military aircraft and ships are being deployed to provide help. Aid is being flown into the only regional international airport at Cebu, with relief efforts focusing on Tacloban. Other countries have also pledged millions of dollars in assistance. Britain is earmarking £10m ($15); Australia has approved $9m in humanitarian aid to the Philippines; while New Zealand has pledged over $1m. Typhoon Haiyan later made landfall in Vietnam, near the tourist destination of Ha Long Bay, with sustained winds of up to 140 km/h (85mph). Despite losing much of its strength, the storm still felled trees and damaged buildings, with reports of some casualties. Some 600,000 people were evacuated in northern provinces of the country.
Imports also fell for the month by 16.1% in yuan terms, compared with forecasts for a fall of about 12%. That means the country's trade surplus has risen to 210.2 billion yuan (£21bn; $32.4bn) from 18.6bn yuan in March. Recent economic data from the mainland has shown further signs that China's slowdown is continuing. "[The surplus rise] was mainly due to further import weakness," said Moody's analyst Alistair Chan in a note. "Imports have slowed on account of the housing slump and reduced demand for commodities, while exports have been softened on account of the uneven global recovery," he said. Economist Tony Nash of Delta Economics said there was clearly pressure on China's trade environment. "But the environment is improving and will continue through the second quarter," he said. "We see some difficulties in the third quarter, with recovery late in the year." In US dollar terms, China's exports for the month fell 6.4%, while imports fell 16.2%, and the trade surplus rose to $34.13bn. Some official numbers from the mainland are now reported by media in both currencies, because of currency conversion factors based on US dollar and Chinese yuan movements over the last year. China's economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, its weakest for almost 25 years.
The three-year contract with Chinese video streaming service PPTV is set to be the league's biggest-ever overseas broadcast sale. A PPTV source told the BBC a deal was in place. If the reported value is confirmed, it would be worth ten times more than the league's current China TV deal. The Premier League is yet to comment. Superpower ambitions PPTV is owned by Chinese retailer Suning, which is already invested in European football after it bought a controlling stake in Italian club Inter Milan in June. China's President Xi Jinping has led a drive for businesses to invest more in football in a bid to turn the country into a footballing superpower. He has set a target for the nation to be the world's biggest sports economy by 2025. Manchester City, West Bromwich Albion and Aston Villa are among the English clubs to have received investment from China over the last year. Audiences for Premier League football are also growing strongly in China, with English clubs seeing the world's second largest economy as a major growth market. The nation's own Super League is also helping to fuel the boom, as it attracts well-known players and managers from the European leagues. The Associated Press news agency reported that the TV deal would be worth $700m, working out at $233m-a-year starting in the 2019-2020 season. Other reports have suggested the deal is worth $600m. The Premier League's largest overseas TV rights deal is currently with US broadcaster NBC, which paid $1bn for six seasons, or $167m per campaign. But the main source of the league's income still comes from the UK. British broadcasters Sky and BT last year agreed to pay a record £5.14bn for three seasons, starting with the current 2016-2017 campaign. Analysis by Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai If Manchester United and other top English Premier League clubs are willing to parade their players in a series of exhibition games across China as soon as the domestic season is finished, then you can see how important this market is. EPL (as it's known here) is big. The fact that even David Beckham's son is the centrepiece of an advert for a smartphone in China shows you the strength of its appeal. Basketball is long established in China. The NBA has a huge following. Rugby Union, Cricket and the NFL all have ambitions here. But China's association with English football is deepening. Chinese investors have acquired what seems like most of the West Midlands clubs in a show of status and financial might, but also for some a genuine attempt to build new brands that could appeal beyond their domestic base. This broadcast deal, unsurprisingly, reveals how important web-based distribution is here for certain types of entertainment. But what you might call 'revenue issues' remain. There are plenty of illegal ways to watch EPL games in China and I'm pretty sure that the England away kit I saw listed on a very well-known Chinese internet retailer - for the equivalent of £7.50 - wasn't the real deal.
By John SudworthBBC News, Shanghai And in the early part of this year, much of the gossip among the shop owners and stall holders centred on the goings on, and the money to be made, not far away on the other side of the dirty old Huangpu River, at the Shanghai Stock Exchange. "I hadn't done any stock market investments before," Lin Jinxia tells me, "but I was influenced by all the talk." Ms Lin lives at the top of seven flights of stairs, the landings of which are littered with dusty old bicycles, in a tiny apartment with her husband and her four-year-old son. They're migrant workers who arrived from Fujian Province five years ago and, through hard graft in their shop selling buttons to a bustling garment industry, they've saved themselves a tidy fortune. Then in May this year they ploughed a large chunk of it into the stock market, investing more than 200,000 RMB ($32,000: £20,000) into four separate stocks. It seemed a sensible enough spread with picks from the electronics, fashion and car-sales industries. But the timing was terrible. They all tanked, collectively standing now at just half of their original purchase price, amounting to a combined loss for Ms Lin and her husband of 100,000 RMB. "I've lost so much of the money that I've worked so hard for," she says. "Now I'm having to save and cut down on my spending. We don't earn much, it was all money from our hard work." In China, unlike in the European or US markets, individuals make up around 80% of the investors. Many of them are new and inexperienced, often following whim and rumour to make decisions and so the market is arguably more vulnerable to quick turnarounds in herd behaviour. Having been marching share prices up the hill for well over a year, on 12 June the crowd suddenly veered back down again and three weeks later almost a third of the value - $3.2 trillion - had been wiped away in three short weeks. 'I knew there were risks' Chen Zhihui's small tailors shop can be found - although not that easily - down a passageway close to Lin Jinxia's home. And like his neighbour, he too acted on the advice of all those who had, until recently, been making nice fat paper profits, not realising he was entering the fray at the worst possible moment. "To me, personally, I knew there were risks," he tells me from his tiny workspace with his sewing machine whirring away beside us. He bought just one company, 10,000 RMB's worth of a Chinese steel-maker, only to find his shares suddenly trading at around half their original value. And while his losses are relatively small, Mr Chen is well aware that in almost every other shop and home in this district and beyond, there are others in a similar predicament, or fearing that they soon might be. "If everyone lost 5,000 RMB it could add up to a big amount," he says. For many analysts that explains why the Chinese government has been so keen to stop the market sliding any further. Economic impact Once it saw a buoyant stock market as a key part of its strategic shift to a consumer society with rapidly increasing share ownership having the twin benefits of both recapitalising the country's big debt-laden firms and, at the same time, making the small punter feel richer. Now the Communist party faces the frightening prospect of the very opposite effect; as savings vanish into thin air, millions of investors are simultaneously tightening their belts with potentially chilling impacts for the Chinese economy and beyond. For now, it is only the late arrivals to China's stock market binge that have been burned, with the recent, sharp depreciation in value still comfortably outweighed by longer term gains going back a year and more. But the slew of measures the authorities have unleashed in the past few days are part of an attempt - perhaps futile - to stop things getting any worse. It has been criticised by outside observers, of course, as dangerous political meddling in the workings of the markets and their ability to put a proper price on risk. But then, it could be argued, that exact same charge could be levelled at the attempts to pump up the markets in the first place. Politics not economics Some analysts dismiss the fear that a full blown stock market collapse could precipitate a wider economic shock. "The stock market is too small, too tiny, completely irrelevant," Chen Long, China economist at Gavekal Dragonomics tells me. "It accounts for just 5% of Chinese household wealth and anyway the market is still up on where it was last year." Much more could yet be wiped off the value of Chinese shares, it would follow, before anyone needs to panic, least of all the government. So perhaps, if this view is correct, Beijing's actions are motivated by the need to contain the political fallout, rather than the economic. In the middle of an already tricky slowdown in GDP growth the last thing it needs is hordes of mom and pop stock traders taking to the streets. And so far, at least, that part of the strategy might be working with little sign of any anger. Despite her already heavy losses, Lin Jinxia's plan is to hang onto her massively devalued stock in the hope it rises again. "I believe the government will come up with the right strategies," she tells me. Confident investor Liu Changrong is a restaurateur, selling noodles, pork chops and sticky rice a block or so's walk from Mr Chen the tailor. He is either canny or lucky, or both. "You just need to buy at the right point," he tells me. He did exactly that, buying 200,000 RMB worth of shares in a large Chinese conglomerate last year and then selling them all in May, just below their peak. He made a very nice profit indeed, coming out more than 50%. You might think that would be a good place to call it a day. But despite the cautionary tales of his neighbours all around him he's still confident the government will turn things around. "When the market improves, I'll get back in again," he tells me as he puts a big pan of water on to boil.
The singer was admitted to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre on Wednesday, but released the same day. Doctors have advised the 65-year-old star against working while he completes a course of antibiotics. The remaining 11 concerts of his Million Dollar Piano residency at Caesars Palace take place in October. "Elton developed a serious respiratory infection last weekend while performing at The Colosseum on Sunday, May 20," said a statement by his publicist, Fran Curtis. "This week the condition worsened, even with medication and rest, resulting in Elton being hospitalised." The statement added that the singer underwent "extensive tests" and was recommended to take "complete rest" for "approximately seven days... to cure his respiratory infection and prevent any damage". Sir Elton added his own apologies: "All I can say to the fans is 'sorry I can't be with you'." "I love performing the show and I will be thrilled when we return to the Colosseum in October to complete the 11 concerts." Sir Elton was previously forced to cancel two concerts in February, after he came down with food poisoning. Gibb dedication The singer, whose hits include Your Song and Candle in the Wind, began his three-year headlining stint in Las Vegas in September last year. Earlier this week, he dedicated his track Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me to Bee Gees singer Robin Gibb, who died at the weekend. "The Bee Gees were part of my life when I was growing up; they were a huge influence on me as a songwriter," he told the audience. "Travel well Robin - you were amazing. God bless you." The singer is expected to perform at The Queen's Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace on 4 June, before embarking on a tour of Europe in June and July. He returns to the United States and Canada for a series of concerts in September, before completing the Las Vegas residency.
By Paul RinconScience editor, BBC News website The office of the US national intelligence director says that the virus was not man-made or genetically modified. But intelligence officials are investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or through a laboratory accident. So what, if anything, does this add to our understanding of the current pandemic? What do the cables say? The Washington Post newspaper reported information obtained from diplomatic cables on 14 April. They show that, in 2018, US science diplomats were sent on repeated visits to a Chinese research facility. Officials sent two warnings to Washington about the lab. The column says the officials were worried about safety and management weaknesses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and called for more help. It also claims diplomats were concerned the lab's research on bat coronaviruses could risk a new Sars-like pandemic. The newspaper says the cables fuelled more recent discussions in the US government about whether the WIV or another lab in Wuhan could have been the source of the virus behind the current pandemic. In addition, Fox News issued a report promoting the lab origin theory. The outbreak came to light late last year when early cases were linked to a food market in Wuhan. But despite rampant online speculation, there is no evidence of any kind that the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) was released accidentally from a lab. On 30 April, the US national intelligence director's office issued a statement rejecting the most extreme of the conspiracy theories about the virus's origins - that it was conceived as a bioweapon. It said the intelligence community was still examining whether the outbreak began "through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan". But President Donald Trump appeared to undercut that statement in a press briefing the same day. Asked whether he had seen anything to make him think the WIV was the source of the outbreak, he replied: "Yes, I have. Yes, I have." China rejects the idea and has criticised the US response to the crisis. What kind of security measures do labs use? Laboratories studying viruses and bacteria follow a system known as the BSL standards, where BSL stands for Biosafety Level. There are four levels, which depend on the types of biological agents being studied and the containment precautions needed to isolate them. Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) is the lowest and is used by labs studying well-known biological agents that pose no threat to humans. The containment precautions increase through the levels until you arrive at Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) which is the highest, and reserved for labs dealing with the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments: ebola, Marburg virus and - in the case of just two institutes in the US and Russia - smallpox. The BSL standards are applied internationally, but with some cosmetic variations. "The Russians, for instance, label their highest containment labs as 1 and the lowest containment labs as 4, so the exact opposite of the standard, but the actual practices and infrastructure requirements are similar," says Dr Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity expert at King's College London. But while the World Health Organization (WHO) has published a manual on the different levels, the standards are not enforced by any treaties. "They've been developed to be in the best interest for working safely, for lab workers who don't want to infect themselves or their community, and for the environment to avoid accidental releases," says Dr Lentzos. But she adds: "The 'stick' comes with the purse strings. If you want to do projects with international partners they require labs to be operating to certain standards. Or if you have products to sell in the market, or perform certain services, e.g. tests, then you are also required to operate to international standards." Indeed, the WIV had received funding from the US, along with assistance from American research institutes. The cables recommended giving them even more help. What kinds of security failures were the cables describing? The short answer is we don't know from the information provided in the Washington Post. But, generally speaking, there are multiple ways that safety measures can be breached at labs dealing with biological agents. According to Dr Lentzos, these include: "Who has access to the lab, the training and refresher-training of scientists and technicians, procedures for record-keeping, signage, inventory lists of pathogens, accident notification practices, emergency procedures." But how unusual were the concerns expressed in the diplomatic cables? Accidents happen. In 2014, forgotten vials of smallpox were found in a cardboard box in a research centre near Washington. In 2015, the US military accidentally shipped live anthrax samples instead of dead spores to as many as nine labs across the country and a military base in South Korea. In four instances between 2003 and 2004, the Sars virus was accidentally released at laboratories in Singapore, Taiwan and Beijing. There are variations in safety standards across the large number of labs at the lower end of the BSL scale and many lesser breaches don't make it into the news. But there are relatively few labs that are designated BSL-4. Wikipedia lists over 50 around the world, of which WIV was one, but there is no authoritative list. They have to be built to very high specifications because they deal with the most dangerous pathogens known to science. As a result, they generally have good safety records. So any concerns about procedures at one of these facilities would be more than noteworthy. Weren't there previous claims of the virus leaking from a lab? Yes, almost as soon as the novel coronavirus came to light, there was speculation - much of it uninformed - about its origins. One online theory that surfaced in January suggested the virus could have been engineered in a lab as a bioweapon. This allegation has been repeatedly dismissed by scientists, who note that studies show the virus originated in animals - most likely in bats. Viruses can also be engineered for the purposes of scientific research. For example, studies may improve the ability of a pathogen to cause disease, to investigate how viruses could mutate in future. But a US study of the coronavirus genome published in March found no signs it had been engineered. "By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that Sars-CoV-2 originated through natural processes," co-author Kristian Andersen, from Scripps Research in California, said at the time. Pathogens can be made to mutate in a laboratory without the directed manipulation of their genes. In so-called "passage experiments", viruses or bacteria are passed from one lab animal to another in order to study how the agents adapt to their hosts. Past experiments have succeeded in making viruses more transmissible between animals using this low-tech method. But, again, there is no evidence that this played any role in the origin of the novel coronavirus. Then there is the allegation of an accidental release of a natural virus from a lab. The proximity of the Huanan Seafood and Wildlife Market in Wuhan, where the outbreak came to light, to at least two centres carrying out research on infectious diseases fuelled speculation about a link. In addition to the WIV, the city is home to another institute - the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. That the WIV had carried out research on bat coronaviruses is a matter of public record. This work was entirely legitimate and published in international journals. Given the country's experience with the Sars outbreak in the early 2000s, this should come as no surprise. But the predominant narrative about an origin at the food market had been questioned as early as January. A paper published at the time in The Lancet showed that, while most of the early Covid-19 patients had been directly exposed to the market, many others had no known link. However, it's also possible those other patients were connected in ways that aren't yet understood. Dr Lentzos said the issue of the virus' origin was a "very difficult question", and added that "there have been quiet, behind-the-scene discussions... in the biosecurity expert community, questioning the seafood market origin that has come out very strongly from China". But there is currently no evidence that any research institute in Wuhan was the source of Sars-CoV-2. On 16 April, China's foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian addressed the matter at a news conference, telling journalists the World Health Organization's officials "have said multiple times there is no evidence the new coronavirus was created in a laboratory". China has repeatedly been accused of lacking transparency in the early stages of the outbreak, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said Beijing "needs to come clean" on what they know. Amid this war of words between the countries, the painstaking - and largely unseen - scientific work to trace the origin of the virus will continue. Follow Paul on Twitter.
He died at home in Los Angeles with his wife and family by his side, a statement posted on social media said. Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer four years ago but had not made the information public. The news has left fans and the film world stunned. Get Out director Jordan Peele said it was "a crushing blow". "A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much," his family said in the statement. "From Marshall to Da 5 Bloods, August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and several more - all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. It was the honor of his career to bring King T'Challa to life in Black Panther." Boseman came to prominence playing real-life figures - baseball great Jackie Robinson in 2013's 42, and soul singer James Brown in 2014's Get on Up. However, it will be as the titular Black Panther in the blockbuster 2018 film he will be best remembered. Boseman stars as the ruler of Wakanda, a fictional African nation with the most advanced technology on earth. As well as winning critical praise and taking more than $1.3 billion US dollars (£973m) at cinemas worldwide, the film was widely seen as a cultural milestone for having a largely black cast and a black director, Ryan Coogler. Boseman said last year that the film had changed what it means to be "young, gifted and black". Black Panther was the first superhero film to get a nomination for best picture at the Oscars. He also played the same role in other Marvel films Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame. A sequel was in the works and due to come out in 2022, with Boseman set to return. The news of his death came as a shock to many as Boseman never discussed his diagnosis publicly. However, fans started raising concerns over his health this year due to noticeable weight loss. Tributes have already begun pouring in for the star, including from actor and fellow Marvel star Mark Ruffalo. Actor Dwayne Johnson tweeted: "Thank you for shining your light and sharing your talent with the world. My love and strength to your family." Political figures have also started paying their respects, including Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Former President Barack Obama added his voice to the tributes, describing Boseman as "blessed" and praising his contribution. The hashtag #WakandaForever has also been trending. Born in South Carolina as the son of a nurse and an upholstery entrepreneur, Boseman graduated from Howard University in Washington DC. Despite playing roles on television, it wasn't until 2013 that he hit the big time in 42. In 2018, Boseman returned to his university to speak at its graduation ceremony. "Some of you here struggled against the university itself," he said to the mostly minority ethnic audience. "Many of you will leave Howard and enter systems and institutions that have a history of discrimination and marginalisation. "The fact that you have struggled with this university which you love is a sign that you can use your education to improve the world that you are entering."
The report by the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) also said relocating the submarines would be far cheaper than previously assumed. But it could take a decade to build a base for the submarines elsewhere in the UK, it said. The SNP wants to remove nuclear weapons within four years of independence. The submarines carrying the UK's nuclear deterrent currently operate from the Faslane naval base on the Clyde. There have been concerns over how they could be relocated in the event of a "Yes" vote in September's independence referendum. Milford Haven in Wales and "the most obvious replacement", Devonport base in Plymouth, have been suggested as potential new homes for the submarines. Falmouth in Cornwall is named as a possible munitions site. Former cabinet minister Lord Forsyth has previously warned that the potential difficulties of moving the submarines would mean that the UK could be forced to give up its nuclear deterrent if Scotland votes in favour of independence. But in their paper, Rusi research analyst Hugh Chalmers and research director Malcolm Chalmers said relocating Trident would be both financially and technically feasible. They suggested that recreating the required nuclear facilities outside Scotland would add between £2.5-3.5bn to the cost of maintaining a nuclear-armed fleet, plus the cost of acquiring and clearing land. This would be far less than a previously-predicted £20-25bn, they said. Hugh Chalmers said the research by the military think tank contrasted with an "unlikely consensus" between supporters and opponents of Scottish independence that it would be impossible to relocate the nuclear weapons elsewhere. If the question mark over Trident's future could be answered, it would help untangle a difficult issue surrounding Scottish independence, he added. Analysis: Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent Britain's nuclear deterrent doesn't come cheap. It'll cost around £20bn to replace the current fleet of four Trident submarines, sometime during the next decade. Not everyone's convinced - either in Parliament or the MOD - that the UK can afford or really needs a like for like replacement. This study, by the distinguished defence think tank Rusi, highlights the additional costs if Scotland votes for independence. It concludes that moving the deterrent from the Clyde and the secure storage facilities for the warheads at Coulport is financially and technically feasible but wouldn't be cheap - between an additional £2.5bn to £3.5bn. It'll also cost a lot of political capital - persuading people of Plymouth and Falmouth that it's in their interests to have the deterrent and warheads based in their backyard instead. The Ministry of Defence has already had to cut its cloth to the tougher economic climate. It would rather not contemplate an even bigger dent to its finances as a result of a "Yes" vote. Mr Chalmers said: "When people start considering options for relocations it's only natural to assume that it would be quite expensive and very difficult and that is certainly the case. But importantly it is not impossible. "We estimate that essentially the net costs of relocating could actually be £2.5-3.5bn at 2012 prices, rather than the tens of billions or even £20bn that has been put forward so far." But he said it would take a long time, and was unlikely to be completed by the SNP's target date of 2020. Mr Chalmers said: "It may be possible to deactivate Trident by that point and have it out of Scotland but it's unlikely we would have been able to have it up and running in a new location by that point. "The Scottish government has acknowledged that if they were to become independent there would be a period of time where the UK would be basing its nuclear forces in an independent country. The UK would be the first country to ever do this." A more "natural timeframe" would be linked to the entry of a new generation of nuclear-armed submarines, currently anticipated to start in 2028, he argued. Mr Chalmers said the Rusi paper showed the possibility of a "space for a friendly and amicable settlement" over Trident in the event of independence. He added: "Effectively this is a key aspect of any negotiations that will emerge after a Yes vote. "This will be a very, very important issue. If both Scotland and the UK can show that they can come to some sort of amicable arrangement then that untangles a very knotty issue. "We are trying to essentially dispel the myth that relocating Trident out of Scotland is impossible and in doing so create some space allowing an amicable settlement to be reached in the event of a Yes vote." 'Speedy withdrawal' A spokeswoman for the Scottish government said: "As Rusi's paper shows, the UK government has choices on what it decides to do with its nuclear weapons following their removal from an independent Scotland, including of course the potential to reconsider the possession and planned renewal of Trident. "The Scottish government will work responsibly with the government in Westminster in securing the speediest safe withdrawal of Trident from an independent Scotland. "We look forward to the opportunity to discuss these arrangements with the UK government following a vote for independence." A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said: "There are no plans to move Trident from Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde and unilateral disarmament is not an option. "We are not planning for Scottish independence and as such it is difficult to estimate the total costs, or how long it would take, to replicate the facilities at Faslane, but it would likely cost taxpayers billions of pounds and take many years."
The two princes said that "the time is right to recognise her positive impact" with a permanent statue. The sculpture will be erected in the public grounds of her former residence, Kensington Palace. A sculptor has yet to be chosen but a spokesperson said work on the artwork would begin soon. Princes William and Harry said in statement: "It has been 20 years since our mother's death and the time is right to recognise her positive impact in the UK and around the world with a permanent statue. "Our mother touched so many lives. We hope the statue will help all those who visit Kensington Palace to reflect on her life and her legacy." 'Cinderella causes' The Queen has said she "supports" her grandchildren commemorating Princess Diana. Royal historian Kate Williams told the BBC it was an opportunity for the princes to "put their stamp" on their mother's legacy as "a great charitable patron". "The princes have really taken up her mantle of the charity work - particularly of looking at the Cinderella causes, that don't get that much attention," she added. The Princess of Wales died on 31 August 1997 in a car crash in Paris, when the Duke of Cambridge was 15 and his brother was 12. The princes' statue will be the fourth London-based monument dedicated to Princess Diana, and will be close to the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain in Hyde Park, and the memorial garden close to Kensington Palace. An artist will be chosen by a committee of six people, which includes Diana's sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale. Camilla Tominey, royal editor of the Sunday Express, said: "This is Harry and William saying that want a more permanent and personal memorial to their mother. They were too young when she died to have any role in the memorial." She added: "There's a sense that people want to go somewhere and pay their respects two decades on." 'A long time coming' By Peter Hunt, royal correspondent This national monument to the wife of one future king and the mother of another has been a long time coming. The Queen Mother statue was unveiled seven years after her death. Some of Diana's friends have argued it would be difficult to capture the princess in stone. Others have questioned whether the failure to do so was more a reflection of establishment ambivalence towards what Diana represented. Until now, the main memorial has been a fountain in London's Hyde Park. For its supporters, the granite structure embodies the princess's spontaneity. Its critics have likened it to the outflow from a power station. As children, Prince William and Prince Harry watched as controversy surrounded the building of this fountain. As adults, they're using their wealth - and that of others - to erect a statue of their mother. Read more from Peter Hunt The announcement comes after Prince William said his mother's death made him "very angry". The rare admission was made during a visit to a London bereavement centre. Her death led to an international public outpouring of grief, marked by millions of tributes being left at royal residences for many months. It is thought her funeral was watched by two billion people worldwide. In July 2016, Prince Harry said he did not talk about his mother's death "for the first 28 years of my life". The 20th anniversary of Princess Diana's death will be commemorated by Earl Spencer, her brother, with a host of exhibitions at the family's home in Althorp.
Huawei is to invest the funds in areas such as mobile broadband over five years, creating up to 700 new jobs. Prime Minister David Cameron said the investment demonstrated that the UK is "open for business". The company's overseas expansion plans have been met with suspicion in the US and Australia amid concerns about cyber-security. Earlier this year, Huawei was barred from bidding for a new nationwide broadband installation project in Australia. Mr Cameron said: "The investment announced by Huawei today demonstrates once again that the UK is open for business. I welcome this and I want to see more companies invest in the UK as we work to achieve sustainable and balanced growth within our economy." The Chinese firm said that it already employs over 800 people in the UK. Huawei was founded in 1987 by Ren Zhengfei, who had previously served in the Chinese army, and remains a private company. "The UK is one of the most important European markets in which Huawei has invested," said Mr Ren. ''The UK is a centre of innovation, has a highly skilled workforce, and is respected internationally for the quality of its legal and educational systems. It is for these reasons we have selected the UK as the location for a number of our centres of excellence."
He had previously suggested that they could be relaxed as early as Easter, which falls in mid-April. "The highest point of the death rate is likely to hit in two weeks," Mr Trump said. He appeared to be referring to peak infection rates that experts fear could overwhelm hospitals. White House medical adviser Dr Anthony Fauci had earlier warned that the virus could kill up to 200,000 Americans. Dr Fauci said that it was "entirely conceivable" that millions of Americans could eventually be infected. The US now has more than 153,000 confirmed cases. As of Monday afternoon, 2,828 deaths had been recorded in the country in relation to Covid-19, according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. The US last week became the country with the most reported cases, ahead of Italy and China. What did Trump say? Speaking during the White House coronavirus briefing on Sunday, Mr Trump called social distancing measures "the way you win", adding that the US "will be well on our way to recovery" by June. Suggesting that the "peak" of death rates in the US was likely to hit in two weeks, Mr Trump said that "nothing would be worse than declaring victory before victory is won - that would be the greatest loss of all". Analysts suggest that when Mr Trump referred to a peak in the "death rate", he probably meant the total number of recorded infections. He said the decision to extend social distancing was made after he heard that "2.2 million people could have died if we didn't go through with all of this", adding that if the death toll could be restricted to less than 100,000 "we all together have done a very good job". Mr Trump had previously said that Easter - 10-13 April - would be a "beautiful time" to be able to open at least some sections of the country. On Sunday he said that lifting restrictions at Easter was "just an aspiration". "I wish we could have our old life back... but we're working very hard, that's all I know." He said that "rapid testing" had been approved to get Covid-19 results within five minutes, and that doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers would get them. Earlier tweets, Mr Trump touted a New York Times article which called the president's daily briefings a "ratings hit". However, he claimed in his briefing the ratings figures "don't matter to me". "What matters to me is that we have a victory over this thing as soon as possible" he said. What's the situation in the US? Nationwide measures mean citizens must continue to avoid non-essential travel, going to work, and eating at restaurants or bars. Gatherings are limited to groups of under 10 people. But stricter restrictions apply to millions in some of the worst-hit states. On Saturday residents of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut were instructed not to travel elsewhere within the country for 14 days. Non-essential gatherings in New York City are banned and most businesses are closed as the city faces more than 33,000 cases. Police can issue fines of $250-500 (£200-£400). In California, a "shelter in place" order remains. What about the shortage of equipment? Earlier on Sunday, Mr Trump accused hospitals in some states of "hoarding" ventilators, face masks and other critical medical supplies. "We do have a problem with hoarding... including ventilators. Hospitals need to release them - in some cases they have too many, they have to release medical supplies and equipment," he said. Hospitals "can't hold [ventilators] if they think there might be a problem weeks down the road", he said, alleging that some were "stocked up". The availability of ventilators is a major concern among health professionals as demand has surged. A number of states have warned that they will soon not have enough to treat patients suffering from Covid-19. The virus can cause severe respiratory issues as it attacks the lungs, and ventilators help to keep patients breathing. What's the global picture? More than 33,000 people are now confirmed to have died worldwide after being infected with the new coronavirus. Some of the latest major global developments include:
Northampton Borough Council auctioned the Sekhemka limestone statue to help fund a £14m extension to Northampton Museum and Art Gallery. However, Arts Council England had warned the council its museum could lose its accreditation status. The Egyptian ambassador to Britain said the council should have handed the statue back if it did not want it. Before the auction, Egyptian Ambassador Ahsraf Elkholy condemned the sale as an "an abuse to the Egyptian archaeology and the cultural property". He said: "Our objection starts from this basic principle: how can a museum sell a piece in its collection when it should be on display to the public?" The ambassador said: "We are concerned this piece may be moved into a private collection. 'Darkest cultural day' "A museum should not be a store. Sekhemka belongs to Egypt and if Northampton Borough Council does not want it then it must be given back. "It's not ethical that it will be sold for profit and also not acceptable. The council should have consulted with the Egyptian government." Christie's said it would reveal details of the new owner later. Protesters gathered outside Christie's before the sale said they wanted the statue to be returned to Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities. Sue Edwards, from the Save Sekhemka Action Group, who travelled from Northampton to the auction, said: "This is the darkest cultural day in the town's history. "The local authority has made a huge mistake but we will continue our fight to save Sekhemka." Loss of Arts Council England accreditation would make the museum ineligible for a range of future grants and funding, however the leader of the council David Mackintosh said he did not see why this should happen. Northampton Museum funding: He said that having kept Arts Council England "informed of our actions and plans... we see no reason why we should not retain our accredited status". The statue has not been on display for four years, and no-one had asked to see it in that time, he said. "It's been in our ownership for over 100 years and it's never really been the centrepiece of our collection," he told BBC Look East. "We want to expand our museum and to do that we need to raise the money."
A free-press advocacy group wants to see the documents after their existence was apparently let slip by prosecutors in another case. But prosecutors and the judge noted that US charges are never ordinarily released until after an arrest. Prosecutors did not confirm or deny any such charge sheet against Mr Assange. Barry Pollack, a US lawyer representing Mr Assange, told the BBC he is unaware of the nature of such a criminal complaint. In a federal court on Tuesday in Alexandria, Virginia, Judge Leonie Brinkema called it "an interesting case, to say the least", according to US media. She said she would make a ruling at a later date after receiving more information. Lawyers for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, which filed the motion to unseal, said that since Mr Assange knows he has been charged, there is no rationale for keeping the criminal complaint sealed. But Assistant US Attorney Gordon Kromberg said that in any legal case, "discussion of why it would be sealed cannot be done in a public forum", the Washington Post reported. The purported criminal complaint emerged earlier this month when papers from the Eastern District of Virginia federal court stated "Assange has been charged", though he was not listed as a defendant in that case. A spokesman for the US attorney's office told the New York Times the filing was "made in error". On 16 November, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press filed its motion requesting Judge Brinkema unseal the complaint against Mr Assange. Its director, Bruce Brown, said in a statement: "There's no longer any justification for keeping the criminal complaint, the docket, and other filings related to the prosecution sealed." Although prosecutors have said an erroneous reference was not proof of any actual charges, several US media outlets have cited sources as confirming there is a sealed complaint against Mr Assange. On Tuesday, the Guardian reported that Mr Assange had met former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort several times before the 2016 US election. US investigators are scrutinising whether the Trump campaign was aware of Wikileaks' role in the leaking of Democratic emails that were allegedly stolen by Russian hackers during the American presidential race two years ago. Mr Manafort swiftly denied the Guardian report. "This story is totally false and deliberately libellous," said a statement issued through his spokesman. "I have never met Julian Assange or anyone connected to him." Wikileaks also denied on Twitter that any such meetings had taken place. Mr Manafort was convicted of financial fraud earlier this year as a part of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian election meddling. On Monday, the Mueller team said the former aide had breached his plea deal by repeatedly lying to the FBI. CNN reports that Mr Mueller is also investigating whether Wikileaks or Mr Assange were discussed during a 2017 meeting between Mr Manafort and Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno. Mr Assange took refuge in Ecuador's embassy in London in 2012 amid fears he could be prosecuted for Wikileaks' previous revelations of US national security secrets. Friction between Mr Assange and the diplomatic staff is known to have risen. According to some reports, he has been asked by the embassy to begin paying his own living expenses from December and has to clean the bathroom. His lawyers say his physical and mental health has deteriorated in recent months.
By Richard AndersonBusiness reporter, BBC News And as the chart below shows, in recent years it has begun loosening the purse strings - in 2005, the Chinese government and Chinese companies collectively invested about $17bn (£11bn) in global assets, according to The Heritage Foundation. Last year they invested almost $130bn. That sounds like a lot of money, but in the context of global world trade or the economic output of developed economies, it is small change. For example, the total amount of money invested by China into Britain over the past nine years amounts to just 0.7% of the UK's total GDP in 2012. And Britain is one of the more popular destinations for Chinese investment. It is in the top 10 nations globally and attracts more than double the investment of any other nation in Europe. Globally, Australia comes out top, but even here Chinese investment last year equated to just 0.6% of the country's annual GDP. In developing nations, Chinese investment is more significant. In Nigeria, for example, inflows from China equated to 2% of GDP in 2012. Almost half of all the money invested overseas by China and Chinese companies in the past nine years went into the energy and power sector. China's demand for energy is expected to triple by 2030 so countries with abundant natural resources will continue to attract the most money from China. While more Chinese money is invested in the energy sector than in any other in Britain, China holds a number of investments elsewhere, including in Barclays Bank, BP, Diageo and Thames Water. Most are minority stakes, but it does have a controlling interest in some household names. For example, Bright Foods owns a 60% stake in Weetabix, the Wanda conglomerate owns 92% of Sunseeker boats, while Geely Automobile owns Manganese Bronze, the company that makes London taxis. Some of the companies listed below are not British firms, but the investments shown refer to assets based in Britain. For example, last year China Investment Corporation paid Ferrovial $700m to buy a 10% stake in Heathrow airport, and paid $400m to Deutsche Bank to take a stake in the bank's London offices. There are four other UK companies that have received monies from China, but are not included in the list as the money went into divisions based overseas. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOCC) invested almost $1.5bn to take a 33% stake in Tullow Oil's Ugandan operations in 2011. In 2010, CNOCC spent $270m on a 5% stake in BG's energy interests in Australia. In 2008 and 2009, Aluminium Corporation of China (Chinalco) made two investments totalling $14.3bn in Rio Tinto to take a 12% stake in the mining giant's aluminium operations in Australia, and two years later paid another $1.4bn to Rio for a share of its steel business in Guinea. Finally, in 2008, oil trader Sinochem paid $470m for a stake in oil and gas exploration company Soco International for a stake in its oil business in Yemen.

The election commission said Mr Widodo - widely known as Jokowi - won 53.15% of the vote with his rival, ex-general Prabowo Subianto, on 46.85%. Earlier, Mr Subianto alleged widespread electoral fraud and vowed to challenge the result. Mr Widodo has promised a decisive break with Indonesia's authoritarian past and better social welfare for the poor. Joko Widodo: Key facts Who is Joko Widodo? What does Jokowi win mean for Indonesia? Before the official results were confirmed, the chairperson of Mr Widodo's PDI-P party, Megawati Sukarnoputri, claimed victory on behalf of the candidate and his running-mate Jusuf Kalla. "I want to declare that we, the party that supports and puts forward Joko Widodo and Jusuf Kalla, has won," she told reporters on Tuesday evening. Indonesia's politics has traditionally been dominated by establishment figures from the political elite and military. A former furniture-maker who grew up in a small village, Mr Jokowi is seen as a clean politician in touch with the masses. The Jakarta governor has proved to be particularly popular with urban and rural youth. His rival Mr Subianto is a former general closely associated with the traditional elite. He had the backing of media tycoons. A former son-in-law of Indonesia's ex-leader Suharto, Mr Subianto has faced multiple questions over alleged human rights abuses. Jubilant supporters took to Twitter with congratulatory messages for Mr Widodo, using the hashtag #presidenbaru (New President). Meanwhile about 100 supporters of Mr Subianto held a peaceful protest about 300m from the election commission building in Jakarta, declaring Mr Subianto the real president, the Associated Press reports. Mr Subianto said earlier on Tuesday that his camp would not resort to violence as it challenges the results. Security was tight for the announcement, with more than 250,000 police officers on duty across the nation, amid fears that supporters from both camps would clash. About 130 million votes were cast on 9 July following an intense election campaign. It was followed by a controversial vote-counting period in which both candidates raised concerns about voting irregularities. But Mr Widodo's winning margin of 6% win is seen as decisive by analysts. They say that even if Mr Subianto's claim of electoral fraud in certain areas proved to be true, this would be unlikely to change the overall results. Mr Subianto has three days to file an appeal with Indonesia's constitutional court. The court has till 22 August to make a ruling on the results.
In a court filing on Wednesday, the star's legal team said he had paid more than $1.3m (£1m) in costs and loaned $8m to Jolie to help her buy a house. On Tuesday, Jolie's lawyer said Pitt had paid "no meaningful child support" since she filed for divorce in 2016. The couple had been together since 2005 but only married in 2014. In the documents, Pitt's lawyers also said Jolie's claims regarding child support were a "thinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage". Her lawyer said in the filing on Tuesday: "[Pitt] has a statutory duty to pay child support. As of present, [he] has paid no meaningful child support since separation. "Given that the informal arrangements around the payment of the children's expenses have not been regularly sustained... for over a year and a half, [Jolie] intends to file... for the establishment of a retroactive child support order," the documents stated. Responding to Pitt's rebuttal, Jolie's lawyer Samantha Bley DeJean said she hoped the dispute could be resolved "without further delay or posturing". "A loan is not... child support and to represent it as such is misleading and inaccurate," she said. "Angelina is asking Brad to pay 50% of the children's expenses. He has not. "Angelina has had to shoulder the majority of those without his contribution for the past two years. Child support is not optional in California." Jolie cited "irreconcilable differences" when she filed to end the marriage, and the pair became embroiled in a bitter child custody battle in the months following the announcement. Pitt was investigated for possible child abuse after losing his temper in front of some of the children, but was later cleared of the allegations. The couple were known as "Brangelina" by fans and met on the set of the 2005 film Mr and Mrs Smith. The marriage was Pitt's second, having previously wed Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie's third after actors Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller.

It comes two days after a pipe bomb was found at the home of liberal philanthropist and financier George Soros in the suburbs of New York City. CNN's New York office was evacuated on Wednesday morning after a suspected bomb was sent to their mailroom. President Donald Trump said that these threats "have no place in America". Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump said that he has been briefed by the FBI and "a major federal investigation is now under way". "The safety of the American people is my highest and absolute priority," he said. "In these times we just have to unify. We need to come together and send one very clear unmistakable message that threats or acts of political violence of any kind have no place in America." When asked about the pattern of these attempted attacks, during a news conference, New York Police Commissioner O'Neill said law enforcement is proactively contacting people to ensure other mail rooms "follow proper protocol". The FBI in New York said they were aware of the suspected packages, and that their Joint Terrorism Task force is aiding in the investigation. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio decried the attempted attacks as "an act of terror attempting to undermine our free press and leaders of this country". "To all public officials, to all partisan affiliations - don't encourage violence, don't encourage hatred, don't encourage attacks on media you can disagree but you have to show respect." Who has been sent these packages? The packages were addressed to former President Obama, ex-Secretary Clinton and former CIA Director John Brennan. Additional suspicious packages addressed to Democratic Representative Maxine Waters and former Attorney General Eric Holder are currently being investigated by law enforcement. The packages to Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton were intended to arrive at their residences. FBI Special Agent Bryan Paarman told reporters the device for Mr Brennan, which appeared to be live, had been sent to CNN's mailroom. One of the packages sent had listed Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, as the sender. The package intended for Mr Holder was sent to an incorrect address and returned to the congresswoman's office in Sunrise, Florida, US media say. Mr Brennan was scheduled to appear on CNN on Wednesday, US media report. Mr Brennan, is a frequent contributor to the network and has become a vocal critic of Mr Trump since leaving office. According to a statement from the US Secret Service, the package addressed to Mrs Clinton was recovered late on 23 October. "Early this morning, October 24, 2018, a second package addressed to the residence of Former President Barack Obama was intercepted by Secret Service personnel in Washington, DC," the statement adds. "Both packages were intercepted prior to being delivered to their intended location. The protectees did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them." These attempted attacks come two days after a confirmed pipe bomb was discovered in a mailbox at the home of Mr Soros, who has been criticised by right-wing groups for supporting liberal causes. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had said a suspicious package had been sent to his office, but New York police told the BBC "it was a thumb drive and is not related to other events". What was in the packages? The devices are suspected to be pipe bombs. Law enforcement officials tell US media that the device discovered at CNN on Wednesday appears to be similar to the one found at Mr Soros' home on Monday. Police commissioner Mr O'Neill also said law enforcement found an "envelope containing white powder" in the packaging of the device sent to CNN. The powder is being investigated, but authorities found "no additional threats" after sweeping the area. A US official told the Associated Press that a "functional explosive device" was found during a screening of mail sent to the home of Mr and Mrs Clinton in Chappaqua, New York. Speaking at a campaign event in Florida, Mrs Clinton thanked the Secret Service and said she and her family "are fine". "It is a troubling time," she said. "It is a time of deep divisions and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together. We also have to elect candidates who will try to do the same." A spokeswoman for Mr Obama declined to comment on the incident, and referred reporters to the Secret Service statement. In a statement, Ms Waters thanked law enforcement and said she "unequivocally condemn[s] any and all acts of violence and terror". What's the reaction? White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders condemned the "attempted violent attacks" against the public figures. In a follow-up tweet, she added that the White House condemnation "certainly includes threats made to CNN as well as current or former public servants". But CNN Worldwide President Jeff Zucker criticised the president and Mrs Sanders in a statement on Wednesday afternoon. "There is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media," he said. "The president, and especially the White House Press Secretary, should understand their words matter. Thus far they have shown no comprehension of that." The president has repeatedly called journalists the "enemy of the people". In a joint statement, top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer also said the president's words "ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence". The US President's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, who received a suspicious package at his New York home earlier this year, tweeted: "As someone whose family has directly been the victim of these mail threats I condemn whoever did this regardless of party or ideology." His sister, Ivanka Trump, also condemned the "acts of violence", while First Lady Melania Trump called them "cowardly", adding "I strongly condemn all that choose violence". Chelsea Clinton, the only child of Bill and Hillary Clinton, tweeted: "Every day, I am grateful to the women and men of the United States Secret Service. Thank you."
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said the killer had apparently been radicalised very quickly. Lahouaiej-Bouhlel, 31, was identified by his fingerprints after his driver's licence, mobile phone and credit card were found inside the vehicle by police who had shot him dead. He had reconnoitred the area in the lorry on the two days before the 14 July Bastille Day attack, when he smashed into the crowd on Nice's famous beachfront, the Promenade des Anglais. So-called Islamic State (IS) says he acted in response to its calls to target civilians in countries that are part of the coalition ranged against the group. 'Far from religion' Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was from the north Tunisian town of Msaken, about 10km (6 miles) outside the coastal city of Sousse. It has emerged that he had a history of violence and mental instability. Neighbours in Nice described him as a violent loner who liked to drink, lift weights and go salsa dancing. He lived a life "far from religion", eating pork, taking drugs and indulging in a "wild" sex life, French prosecutor Francois Molins said. But he had a "clear and recent interest" in radical Islamist movements, Mr Molins said. From 1 July, Lahouaiej-Bouhlel made more or less daily internet searches for verses of the Koran and "nasheeds" - jihadist propaganda chants. He also researched the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr. Investigators found photos of dead bodies and images linked to radical Islamism on his computer, including the flag of so-called Islamic State, the cover of an issue of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo - attacked by gunmen in January 2015 - and photos of Osama bin Laden and Algerian jihadist Mokhtar Belmokhtar. In the eight days leading up to the attack, he grew a beard and told friends this was for "religious reasons". He also told them he did not understand why IS could not hold territory and showed them a video of a beheading on his mobile phone. In response to their shock, he said he was "used to it". However, there was no evidence that he had pledged allegiance to any radical groups or had contact with known Islamists. 'Premeditated and deliberate' Examinations of Lahouaiej-Bouhlel's browsing history also showed he had carried out research for his attack. On 1 July he searched for details of the Bastille Day celebrations in Nice as well as videos showing "terrible" fatal traffic accidents. He had also read about recent attacks in Orlando, where a man proclaiming allegiance to IS shot 49 people in a gay nightclub, Dallas, where a black army veteran shot five police officers, and Magnanville near Paris, where a French jihadist stabbed two police officials to death. In the days before the attack, he twice drove to the Promenade des Anglais in his rented lorry, sold his van and attempted to withdraw money, Mr Molins said. This showed that his act was "premeditated and deliberate", he said. He reserved the 19-tonne refrigeration lorry on 4 July and collected it on 11 July in Saint-Laurent-du-Var, just west of Nice. During his reconnaissance trips, he sent a selfie photo from the driver's cabin. Just minutes before launching his attack, he sent text messages asking accomplices to give him more weapons and boasting about having obtained a pistol. He fired that pistol at police during his rampage, before police shot him dead. "Bring more weapons, bring five to C," one of the messages said. Police are trying to identify who the message was sent to. Four men who knew Lahouaiej-Bouhlel are being questioned by police, as are an Albanian couple suspected of having given him logistical help. 'Quiet loner' Police say Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was married with three children, although he no longer lived with his wife. She was detained for questioning by police on 15 July but has since been released. A woman who knows the family told the BBC Lahouaiej-Bouhlel had been thrown out of their home in the Le Ray area of Nice more than a year ago after allegedly beating his wife. Lahouaiej-Bouhlel last visited Tunisia four years ago, people in his hometown Msaken told the BBC's Rana Jawad. They said many people knew his family and were shocked by his actions. "We remember him as a normal person from a wealthy family," a town resident told her. While many who knew him described Lahouaiej-Bouhlel as being secular, other witnesses pointed out that more recently he had displayed outward signs of becoming more religious. A psychiatrist, Chamseddine Hamouda, carried out a mental assessment of the killer a few years ago after his father became concerned about his "troubling behaviour of a psychotic nature". "He was a stranger to himself," Mr Hamouda said. "I advised his parents that he needed treatment. "At the time he exhibited violent behaviour towards his family... I'm sure that in the past 12 years something else happened that perhaps influenced how he thought." He was "quiet", a "loner" who did not respond to greetings, according to several neighbours in the four-storey block of flats in the Abattoirs area of Nice where he lived. He had a van parked nearby and would often be seen climbing the stairs to his first-floor flat, carrying his bike. Anan, who lived on the ground floor, said she had been suspicious of him because he was "a good-looking man who kept giving my two daughters the eye". One woman recalled that he had been nice to her and had helped her all the time. But, she added, his behaviour had sometimes been "strange". Suspended sentence Lahouaiej-Bouhlel had been in trouble with police between 2010 and 2016 for threatening behaviour, violence and petty theft. In March, a court in Nice convicted him of assaulting a motorist with an improvised weapon - a wooden pallet - during an altercation. He was given a six-month suspended prison sentence and ordered to contact police once a week, which he did. Lahouaiej-Bouhlel was "never flagged for signs of radicalisation", officials say, and he was not on France's "Fiche S" high-security watch list. The majority of attacks carried out in the country since January 2015 have been staged by men designated "Fiche S", and also linked to IS. In 2014, IS spokesman Mohammed al-Adnani told supporters in an audio message: "If you can't detonate a bomb or fire a shot, manage by yourself... run them over with your car." Many of France's jihadist killers, starting with Mohammed Merah in Toulouse in 2012, also began their journey towards militant Islam as petty criminals.
Khaled al-Asaad had been held for about a month by the group, which seized the Unesco World Heritage site in May. The 81-year-old's family informed Syria's director of antiquities Maamoun Abdul Karim that he had been beheaded. Mr Karim said IS militants had tried to extract information from Mr Asaad about where some treasures were hidden. He described Mr Asaad as "one of the most important pioneers in Syrian archaeology in the 20th Century". The murder has been denounced as a "horrific act" by Unesco, the UN cultural organisation. "They killed him because he would not betray his deep commitment to Palmyra," Unesco Director General Irina Bokova said in a statement. "His work will live on far beyond the reach of these extremists," she said. "They murdered a great man, but they will never silence history." IS has demolished several ancient sites in Iraq, and there are fears that it will destroy Palmyra, one of the archaeological jewels of the Middle East. 'Stores of gold' The Syrian state news agency, Sana, and the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that Mr Asaad had been beheaded on Tuesday at a square outside the museum in the modern town next to the ruins, also known as Tadmur, in front of dozens of people. Photos apparently showing Mr Asaad's body tied to what appears to be a lamp-post adjoining a main road have been circulated online by IS supporters. His severed head was placed underneath it. A sign attached to the body accused him of being an apostate who was in regular communication with and supported the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He was also accused of representing Syria at overseas conferences with "infidels", in addition to being director of Palmyra's "idols". The summary killing was one of several that have been carried out by IS in and around Palmyra since they took the city in May. Mr Asaad spent most of his life working to promote and protect Palmyra. He was in charge of the site for four decades until 2003, when he retired. He then worked as an expert with the antiquities and museums department. Khaled al-Asaad Profile of Syria's 'Mr Palmyra' IS threat to 'Venice of the Sands' Your memories of Palmyra Saving history from the jihadists Syrian ruins that influenced the West Jihadists in Palmyra were looking for "stores of gold" in the city, Mr Karim said, [but] "I deny wholeheartedly that these stores exist". Mr Karim described Mr Asaad as "a scholar", while denouncing the presence of IS in Palmyra as "a curse and a bad omen" on the city and "every column and every archaeological piece in it". Abdalrazzaq Moaz, co-director of cultural heritage initiatives at the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR), told the BBC that Mr Asaad had devoted his entire life to the site and died trying to protect it. Since overrunning Palmyra, IS has destroyed a second century statue of a lion and two nearby Islamic shrines, which it described as "manifestations of polytheism". The group also released a video in July showing some 20 captured government soldiers being shot dead at Palmyra's theatre. Syrian government forces have sought to drive IS out of the Palmyra area in recent months and there has been fierce fighting in nearby towns. Also on Wednesday, new images were posted online appearing to show IS "religious police" vandalising ancient artefacts in the northern Iraqi province of Nineveh. Unesco's statement said that Mr Asaad's death was part of two intense blows within a week that had been endured by Syria's cultural heritage community. It said that Qasem Abdullah Yehiya, a senior member of the Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums, was also reported to have been killed in a rocket attack on the Citadel of Damascus last week.
By BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The poll comes amid major tensions with North Korea, rising youth unemployment and bubbling anger among the electorate over corruption. Liberal Moon Jae-in, a human rights lawyer, has dominated opinion polls and is the clear front-runner. His closest rivals are Ahn Cheol-soo, a centre-left IT multi-millionaire, and Hong Joon-pyo, the ruling party candidate. Record numbers cast their ballots in early voting last week and turn-out is expected to be high. Why are people fired up? South Korea is still reeling from the money-for-influence scandal that engulfed the former president, who is currently awaiting trial after being impeached. Huge crowds had protested against Ms Park, amid anger over inequality and the perceived privilege of South Korea's elite. During months of protests older voters came out in support of her, however, exposing a deep generational divide. Whoever wins the election will have to reunite society and tackle the economic and social mobility issues that have energised the youth vote. Last year, youth unemployment stood at 9.8%, highlighting job-seeking challenges for young people. North Korea, meanwhile, remains a pressing challenge. Pyongyang has upped the pace of missile tests in recent months and many expect a sixth nuclear test soon. US leader Donald Trump has adopted a hard-line stance and tensions are at their highest level in years. Who are the main candidates? Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party is out in front of his rivals. An aide to former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, he is trying his chances again after losing to Ms Park in 2012. A student activist, he was expelled from law school in the 1970s after leading a protest against Ms Park's father, strongman President Park Chung-Hee. After qualifying, he worked as a human rights lawyers for years before entering politics when Mr Roh was elected president. Domestically, he has talked of tackling the perceived untouchability of South Korea's huge family-run conglomerates and their cosy ties with the government. On North Korea, he has called for a new vision to achieve peace, one that potentially includes economic engagement - something that critics say channels funds to Pyongyang's nuclear programme. His position on the US missile system, Thaad, remains unclear, but he was critical of the move to roll it out last month. His spokesman called it "very inappropriate" as it stripped the next government of the right to make its own decision on the system. Mr Moon's most prominent rival is Ahn Cheol-soo, a software tycoon and co-founder of the centre-left People's Party. Nicknamed "Korea's Bill Gates", Mr Ahn has portrayed himself as above the corruption that has plagued the political scene. He has described himself as a "conservative in security issues and a reformist in economic affairs". On North Korea, he advocates pressure and dialogue to bring Pyongyang to the negotiating table. He was initially opposed to Thaad but has since said that he will respect an agreement made between countries. A third candidate who has slowly gained popularity is Hong Joon-pyo, from the conservative Liberty Korea Party. This is the party of the impeached Ms Park, previously known as the Saenuri Party. He says national security is top of his agenda. What challenges lie ahead? Though North Korea dominates dialogue on the international stage, for South Koreans it is domestic issues - jobs, transparency, good governance - where they want the new leadership to make rapid improvements. According to a survey by RealMeter, 27.5% said the key issue for them was a candidate's willingness to resolve corruption issues, followed by economic and livelihood issues at 24.5% and national security at 18.5%. But many commentators say the leading candidates have not provided detailed policies. On North Korea, the incoming president will have to contend with a leader in Pyongyang committed to the development of nuclear weapons, a bullish White House that has suggested military action could be on the table if tensions escalate and an electorate that could be caught in the crossfire. Initiating a policy of economic engagement could be very challenging amid these circumstances, analysts suggest. Balancing ties with the US - Seoul's traditional ally - will also be made more complicated by China's furious reaction to the Thaad deployment. Seoul and Washington say the system is aimed at safeguarding against attacks from North Korea, but Beijing says the missile system infringes on its own security and has initiated a number of informal economic sanctions. Mr Trump, meanwhile, recently suggested South Korea should pay for the system, causing consternation in the host nation. He's also threatened to scrap a "horrible" free-trade deal between the two.

The women's teams of Fuzhou and Jimei universities were due to meet for a college league game in the south-eastern Fujian province at the weekend. Team members from both sides bought black hair dye to correct the problem. But one Fuzhou player's hair was deemed "not black enough" and the side had to forfeit for having only six players. Before the match, "multiple players… were rejected from the match for violating a rule which requires that all players do not dye or curl their hair", the national Global Times reports. "Athletes are not allowed to dye their hair, grow long hair [for boys], wear weird hairstyles, or wear any accessories," states the rule of the Fujian Provincial Department of Education, quoted by the South China Morning Post (SCMP). "Otherwise, they will be disqualified from the competition." The rules from the organisers, the National Youth Campus Football League (University Division), go further: "Athletes at all stages shall not have tattoos, dye their hair, wear weird hairstyles, or wear any accessories, otherwise they will be ineligible for the competition." The decision sparked intense debate on social network Weibo, including users expressing anger and mockery, correspondents say. There was talk about how red tape gets in the way of Chinese football players being able to perform well, and some talk about double standards, with one user saying, "Women footballers are not allowed to dye their hair, yet male footballers can be tattooed?" China has been increasingly stepping up regulation since mid-2018 to stop tattoos and earrings being shown on screens. You may also be interested in:
It comes after protesters attacked the Thai consulate in Istanbul following the deportation from Thailand of about 100 Uighurs to China. Rights groups have criticised such deportations, saying Uighurs face persecution in China. Turkey has seen growing anger at Chinese discrimination against Uighurs, who are ethnically Turkic Muslims. But China has said it respects the freedom of Muslim beliefs. On Thursday, close to 100 people were dispersed by pepper spray outside the Chinese embassy in the Turkish capital after a barricade was knocked down. Thai officials said protesters stormed their compound in Istanbul late on Wednesday night. No injuries were reported. The Royal Thai Embassy in Turkey advised Thais in Turkey to not to show the national symbol or flag in public, to avoid protest venues and to "refrain from mentioning or arguing with the Turkish" on the issue of Uighurs. On Thursday, the Thai government confirmed that about 100 Uighurs had been sent back to China the day before. Government spokesman Weerachon Sukondhapatipak said Thailand had verified that the Uighurs were Chinese nationals before returning them, but it is unclear how their nationality was confirmed. Thailand's Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said: "If we don't do it this way, then how would we do it? "Or do you want us to keep them for ages until they have children for three generations?" Human Rights Watch's Asia deputy director Phil Robertson said the Uighurs sent to China "will likely face torture". Rights groups have criticised Cambodia and Thailand for deporting Uighurs to China, saying they face persecution, abuse and human rights violations. Turkey has seen increased protests and isolated attacks on tourists thought to be Chinese over China's treatment of Uighurs. The latest spike of anti-Chinese sentiment began over allegations that Uighurs in China had been banned from fasting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. But China has denied such reports. In previous years, students have told the BBC they have been prohibited from taking part in Ramadan fasts, and government departments have restricted civil servants. Many of China's Uighurs are based in the far western province of Xinjiang, which has seen increased tensions and conflict between Uighurs and authorities in recent years. Who are the Uighurs?

Speaking during a visit to communist Vietnam and talks with its leaders, Mr Obama said the move removed a "lingering vestige of the Cold War". The US is trying to bolster its relationship with its Pacific allies, as China asserts territorial claims. But Mr Obama said the embargo decision was not related to US policy on China. "It's based on our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards normalisation with Vietnam," he said in Hanoi. Vietnam is one of several countries in the region involved in maritime disputes with China. The US insists on the right to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. In 2014, a row over a Chinese oil rig near the Paracel islands led to clashes between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels and anti-China riots in Vietnam. Why Vietnam wants US weapons Beijing's new South China Sea islands High hopes for Obama visit White House officials had indicated the arms ban, in force since 1984, would be lifted only if human rights in Vietnam improved. "Sales will need to still meet strict requirements, including those related to human rights, but this change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself," Mr Obama said after talks with President Tran Dai Quang. Vietnam had been arguing for an end to the embargo, which was partially lifted in 2014. Powerful symbolism: Jonathan Head, BBC News, Hanoi President Obama's easing of all remaining restrictions on arms sales to Vietnam is powerfully symbolic. But what does it mean in practice? Up to now, Vietnam has relied on Russia to supply most of its defence equipment, a legacy of the Cold War, when they were allies. The government would certainly like to diversify its sources, and is looking at a number of potential alternative suppliers. But it won't be rushing into the arms of US manufacturers just yet. One reason is that a lot of US technology may be too sophisticated and expensive for Vietnam's needs. And while Vietnam's defence spending, which has doubled over the past decade, is driven by the rivalry with its giant neighbour China, it will not want to antagonise China by seeking state-of-the-art US weapons that might alter the military balance. Another reason is the complicated process of procuring US weapons. In his announcement, Mr Obama said any military contracts would still be subject to provisos on human rights, and given the Vietnamese government's poor human rights record that might hold up possible arms sales in Congress. The greatest potential for US sales probably lies in areas like military surveillance systems and coastal defence. Vietnam would welcome technology that helps it track Chinese naval forces. The partial lifting of the embargo two years ago was with the specific aim of improving US sales in this area, yet Vietnam is taking its time to decide what it most wants to buy. Mr Obama's visit comes 41 years after the end of the Vietnam War in which the US sought to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam. Several million Vietnamese - civilians, communist fighters and South Vietnamese soldiers - were killed, as well as more than 58,000 US soldiers. By the end of the war in 1975, the communists had gained control of the entire country. While in Vietnam, Mr Obama is expected to meet dissidents and make the case for Vietnam to remove obstacles to the US-led Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal. Amnesty International on Monday accused Vietnamese authorities of "carrying out their repressive business as usual" in arresting six activists. "Before leaving Vietnam, President Obama must insist on the release of all prisoners of conscience," said its international advocacy director, T Kumar. In a separate move, Vietnamese officials have removed the accreditation of the BBC's Jonathan Head in Hanoi after accusing him of conducting an unauthorised interview - something he denies. The US president flies later to Japan for a summit of the G7 industrialised nations. His visit will include a tour of Hiroshima, where the world's first nuclear attack was carried out in 1945 by the US, killing at least 140,000 people. 'Leverage for Vietnam' - media view The lifting of the US arms embargo "will tighten the strategic pressure on China", Vietnamese Communist Youth Union newspaper Tuoi Tre says on its website. "It will also provide Vietnam with leverage in future arms deals with traditional weapons suppliers, particularly its long-time security patron, Russia," the paper says. China's privately-owned portal Sina News sounds a note of alarm, saying that the lifting of the arms embargo "is a cause for concern" because it may have an impact on territorial disputes in the South China Sea. A commentary (in Chinese) by Phoenix TV's news anchor Cheng Helin on Sina's "Headlines Blog" argues that Vietnam is being drawn into "co-operation to contain China" as part of "a three-way alliance with the US and Japan". But, says the author, the US is unlikely to sell Vietnam sophisticated weapons. BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Britain's Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is well versed in the history and culture of ancient Greece. He knows that Western literature begins with a plague, the epidemic described in the opening book of Homer's Iliad - of which Boris can happily declaim scores of verses from memory. And his political hero has long been the ancient Athenian leader, Pericles, whose bust sits in his office in 10 Downing Street. The prime minister has often quoted admiringly the stirring oration given by Pericles to honour the dead after the first year of a destructive war against Sparta. And he will be well aware that Pericles gave a second famous speech a year later, after a devastating plague, probably a form of typhus, had killed around one third of Athens' citizens. Both orations were reported by the contemporary historian Thucydides, whose searing description of the Great Plague is worth reading for its literary virtuosity alone. Commentators today have drawn parallels between the responses of Athenians - ranging from the heroic to the contemptible - and those of valiant NHS staff and scared panic-buyers today. But surprisingly, none has drawn attention to the lesson Thucydides himself intended. What doesn't change, wrote the historian, is human nature; you can expect people to react in similar ways when they encounter events like those that have occurred in the past. He embarked on his work, he says, because a clear grasp of the events he was living through could guide responses to similar events in future. He modelled his method on that of the most innovative medical practitioner of the day, the physician Hippocrates. Rather than prescribing prayers and religious rituals, spells and incantations, or exotic herbs and quack remedies, Hippocrates and his contemporaries were visiting sick patients, meticulously noting their symptoms, and keeping track of how they responded to prescribed treatments such as sleep, exercise, and the regulation of diet. Boris Johnson was a patient at St Thomas' hospital, and is likely to have been participating in a medical trial that compares treatments for Covid-19 - so it may be that Hippocrates will come to his mind, as well as Pericles and Thucydides. "One of the worst aspects of the plague was the despair into which people fell on finding they had the disease. Those who were convinced they had no hope were much quicker to give up and die," observed Thucydides. "Another was the rate of infection among those who flocked to care for and doctor to others: they died in droves, and had the highest incidence of mortality… In addition, the plague led to greater crime, since criminals calculated on escaping detection and penalties." What might we learn from these observations? First, that people should avoid becoming infected by close contact, and that medical staff and carers should be protected. Secondly, that the law must continue to function robustly. And thirdly, that it is important for people to preserve a positive state of mind. Measures to achieve these aims have been, if in some cases belatedly, widely pursued in the UK and elsewhere. The Athenians survived the plague of 430 BC with astonishing resilience. Just 15 years later they were able to muster a huge military and naval force to mount an offensive expedition overseas. But when the plague struck, Athens had only recently gone to war, and a large contingent of troops had been sent north to pursue hostilities. Sadly, they took the disease with them, and over 1,000 men died from it. One of the soldiers serving on the campaign was the philosopher, Socrates. Not only did he survive infection, allegedly thanks to his physical toughness and discipline, but on return to his plague-ridden city he was said to have tended unscathed to the sick and dying. Socrates had evidently acquired immunity from his earlier exposure to the disease, just as Thucydides himself, who had survived infection, recognised that this made him immune from reinfection. It was to be thousands of years before medical immunity was properly understood, but the historian implies that historical hindsight can itself be a kind of vaccine. History need not simply recall the horrors of the past. It can guide us towards adopting precautions, remind us that accurate observation is vital to ensure a better response in future, and reassure us that normal life will one day return. Meanwhile, we should also remember that history never repeats itself exactly, even if it can offer valuable lessons for posterity. Pericles had been the leading citizen in Athens for over three decades before his death from the plague at the age of 66. Until that day his luck had held to a remarkable degree. He had been admired and bitterly reviled, had fought military campaigns and faced legal trials, and had survived accusations of corruption and sexual misconduct. In his 50s he entered into a passionate and enduring relationship with the brilliant young Aspasia of Miletus, who bore him a child and helped him compose his magnificent funeral oration to the war dead. Britain's prime minister is 55. He has faced stern challenges, has experienced failure as well and success, and has benefited greatly from luck, no less than political skill. When, as is hoped, he makes a full recovery from Covid-19, perhaps busts of the historian Thucydides, the physician Hippocrates, and the philosopher Socrates, should join that of Pericles on his mantelpiece in No.10 Downing Street. Prof Armand D'Angour, the author of Socrates in Love: The making of a philosopher, wrote the Greek ode that Boris Johnson recited at the opening gala of the London Olympics in 2012 You may also be interested in: In these dark days of Covid-19 some practices have remained timeless - the use of soap, scrubbing and fresh air.

The 82-year-old, who has had health problems in recent years, reportedly does not wish to remain emperor if he has to reduce his official duties. But a palace spokesman denied that there is any official plan for the monarch to abdicate in what would be an unprecedented move in modern Japan. Crown Prince Naruhito, 56, is next in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne. An unnamed government source told Japan's Kyodo news agency that the emperor, who plays a largely ceremonial role but is respected deeply by many Japanese, has been contemplating the move for about a year. His family had accepted his decision, an unnamed palace source told NHK. However, both palace and government sources say the Imperial Household Law would have to revised to allow for the abdication to take place. A change to the Imperial Household Law, which stipulates the rules of succession, would require approval by Japan's parliament. Despite a categorical denial of the reports by imperial palace spokesman Shinichiro Yamamoto, the emperor's reported wishes are being given prominent attention in the Japanese media. Emperor Akihito has been admired for distancing the monarchy from its association with the aggressive nationalism of World War Two. In 1989 he succeeded his father, Hirohito, who had had the status of a living god in Japan until he was stripped of that role by the victorious Americans who wrote the country's post-war constitution. Emperor Akihito had surgery for prostate cancer in 2003 and a heart bypass operation four years ago. In 2011, he took the highly unusual step of making a televised national address following the devastating earthquake and tsunami at Fukushima. Five things about Japan's emperor:
It is the latest in a series of US military actions seen as a response to China's increasingly assertive claims over territory in the South China Sea. The US says it will also base a military reconnaissance plane at Singapore's Paya Lebar air base. US P-8s already operate from Japan and the Philippines, and surveillance flights have taken off from Malaysia. The P-8 was deployed on Monday, and will remain in Singapore until 14 December. In addition to the P-8 deployment, the US says it will operate a military plane, either a P-8 Poseidon or a P-3 Orion, from Singapore for the foreseeable future, rotating planes on a quarterly basis. The US-Singapore agreement, announced after a meeting in Washington on Monday between US Defense Secretary Ash Carter and Singapore Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, also covers co-operation on counter-terrorism, fighting piracy, and disaster relief. Speaking at a daily news briefing, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the US was "pushing regional militarisation", which did "not accord with the joint long-term interests" of the region. Despite rising tension with China over its South China Sea territorial claims, a US navy spokesman based in Singapore insisted that the deployments were "not solely focussed on the South China Sea". "It's not about the South China Sea, it's about partnership with Singapore and other partners in the region," said Lt Commander Arlo Abrahamson, speaking to the BBC. He pointed to regional co-operation in the search for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 and the Air Asia plane that crashed on 28 December 2014, as examples of the kinds of operations that would be helped by a base in Singapore. A US navy statement also said that the deployment was "in support of shared maritime security and HA-DR (High Availability and Disaster Recovery) initiatives in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region." China claims almost the entire South China Sea, putting it in territorial dispute with several countries, including Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia, among others. It has been building islands, equipped with runways, in the area. China also has a separate dispute with Japan over islands in the East China Sea.
By Duncan LeatherdaleBBC News online Historic castles and cathedrals England is home to hundreds of grand old castles and cathedrals, from St Michael's Mount off the Cornish coast to Bamburgh in Northumberland, and York Minster to London's St Paul's.

The top 10 countries in the list were: Stunning seaside "Once the country's first line of defence against invaders, the English coastline these days is a peaceful place where locals and visitors can enjoy more tranquil pursuits," Lonely Planet judges said. "Taking a bracing walk on a windswept pier, eating delicious fish and chips, searching for marine life in rock pools, finding fossils in ancient cliffs, building sandcastles and dolphin-spotting on picturesque beaches are just some of the activities offered by the English seaside." Lonely Planet said the addition of new stretches of the almost 3,000 mile-long England Coast Path in 2020 would allow visitors to "explore beaches and foreshores right up to the water's edge".

"For a relatively small country, England offers a lot of breath-taking scenery," said Tom Hall, Lonely Planet's vice-president of experience. "It's fantastic to see England scoring so highly with Lonely Planet - and with travellers," said VisitEngland director Andrew Stokes. "It's no surprise it's a favourite global destination with our breath-taking and varied coastline, vibrant cities, stunning countryside, heritage and cultural gems, amazing visitor attractions, enchanting green spaces and outstanding range of quality accommodation. "England truly is packed full of incredible experiences that visitors can only have here." Unmissable experiences While Lonely Planet's judges were wowed by England's overall offerings, they said there were three unmissable experiences. The "magical history tour" that is Northumberland's coast was first with its "dramatic castles", offshore islands featuring puffins and seals and the "spectacular" Holy Island. The Norfolk Coast, an AONB for more than 50 years, is also somewhere not be missed with its expanses of marsh, dunes and clay cliffs. And finally the South West Coast Path "lures hikers with its wonderful walks and photogenic views", the guide said. "If travellers are seeking exhilarating beauty in 2020, England won't disappoint," Mr Hall said. All pictures copyrighted. Related Internet Links Lonely Planet
It found Brits, younger people and those on higher incomes were more likely to have chemsex. More than 22,000 people took part in the Global Drug Survey's research into substance-linked sex. It found alcohol, cannabis, MDMA and cocaine are the drugs most commonly used. Researchers say understanding people's drug use is important so that messages about the harm they can cause can be targeted to the way people live their lives. "By engaging with your audience and accepting that drugs provide pleasure as well as harms, you can deliver harm reduction messages in a more trustworthy and nuanced manner," said lead author Dr Will Lawn. Alcohol 'most popular' The report found alcohol was the most popular drug. Around 58% of men and 60% of women who took part in the survey said they'd drank before sex in the past year. But it's not just booze that's being consumed before Brits get intimate. The report states that people from the UK are most likely to have combined drugs such as cocaine, MDMA and mephedrone with sex. It describes the Brit's use of mephedrone - also known as meow meow - with sex as "particularly striking". The report said that while people of all genders and sexual orientations had chemsex - gay and bisexual men were "more likely to have done so". It also found that "homosexual men were 1.6 times as likely as heterosexual men to have used drugs with the specific intent of enhancing the sexual experience in the last year". Dr Lawn, from the University College London, said that while chemsex is often associated with gay men, the study found "men and women of all sexual orientations engaged in this behaviour". "Harm reduction messages relating to substance-linked sex in general should therefore not only be targeted towards gay and bisexual men, as they are relevant to all groups." 'Regular testing important' Marc Thompson, who leads health improvement at sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust, says combining drugs with sex can increase the chance of catching an STI. "Drug use can lead to people taking risks during sex they wouldn't ordinarily take which increases the chances of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections and why testing regularly is really important," he told Newsbeat. "As this report highlights, drug use and sex is something that is not exclusive to gay and bisexual men but is something that happens across the wider population. "Therefore it's vital that everyone knows the potential risks this can result in." Who took part in the survey? The people who responded to the survey were "self-selecting rather than a representative sample", the research noted. It means the number of people who said they combine drugs with sex will be "substantially larger than the general population". "However, relative differences between groups are expected to be reliable," it added. Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.

A report by the government department which promotes UK businesses put new contracts, sales and foreign investment in the last year down to the Games. But the claims were met with scepticism by some economists and the Federation of Small Businesses. Government estimates put the cost of hosting the Games at £8.9bn. 'Creative accounting' Prime Minister David Cameron said "a lot of deals were done" around the time of the Olympics. The report, for the UK Trade and Investment department (UKTI), said the Olympics resulted in: Much of the Olympic park and stadium for the Winter Olympics in Russia was "designed and built by British businesses", Mr Cameron told BBC Radio's Test Match Special. "So there's real jobs, real money in the Olympics if we get it right." But sports economist Stefan Szymanski said it was impossible to tell how much of the economic activity could be put down to the Games. "It's almost like a bit of creative accounting. There's no way of testing whether what they're saying is really true." Jonathan Portes, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and a former chief economist at the Cabinet Office, said attributing the economic benefits to the Olympics was "a little far-fetched to say the least". Business Secretary Vince Cable defended the figures in the report. "A lot of people were very cynical about this... but as a result of all the work that was done we have this very considerable amount," he said. He added there was an "upward estimate" that, by 2020, the Games could have benefited the UK by as much as £40bn. 'Thrilling chapter' One engineering firm which was behind the Olympic park on the 2012 site said the Games had boosted its standing with other host countries and governments delivering large-scale transport and urban regeneration projects. Mike McNicholas from the Atkins consultancy said: "What we saw in the run-up to the games was a huge interest from overseas governments and industry to look at how the Games was delivered." But for businesses outside London, The Federation of Small Businesses said the impact of the Games had been a disappointment. "The contracts we were expecting really didn't materialise," said national policy chairman Mike Cherry. As well as the financial impact of the Games, the report - Inspired by 2012: The legacy from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games - highlights its influence on sport and regeneration. It also says the Games volunteers inspired more people to take up similar roles in their communities. The National Council for Voluntary Organisations said there had been an "encouraging" boost to volunteering. But funding cuts to the voluntary sector left a "question mark" over the Games' legacy, executive director Justin Davis-Smith warned. The prime minister said: "If you go back to when we first won the Olympics in 2005, we've got 1.4 million more people taking part in sport every week." But BBC sports editor David Bond said in the last year participation had actually dropped by 200,000. Labour's Olympics spokeswoman Tessa Jowell called on the government to reverse the "damage inflicted" to school sport funding. The report also found that employment programmes by Boris Johnson the Mayor of London had failed to deliver long-term Olympic jobs for the capital with only a fraction of people going into the jobs predicted. In a message in the report, Olympics legacy ambassador Lord Coe, who chaired Games organiser Locog, said: "Progress reflected in this report against each of the legacy commitments is a promising start. "There can, however, be no room for complacency. Just as the Games took 10 years to win, plan and deliver, so legacy must be seen as a 10-year project to realise lasting change." International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge said: "The London 2012 Games have definitively served as a catalyst for development and improvements, both tangible and intangible, which would otherwise have taken decades to achieve."
Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan said he was suspending the acceptance of new arrivals until after a review. Alabama, Texas and several other states issued similar statements but a State Department spokesman said the legality of this action was still unclear. President Barack Obama has urged the US to "step up and do its part" to help those fleeing the civil war. "Slamming the door in their faces would be a betrayal of our values," he said. "Our nations can welcome refugees who are desperately seeking safety and ensure our own security. We can and must do both." The governors' decisions come in the wake of the attacks in Paris which killed 129 people on Friday evening. Seven of the perpetrators died in the attacks, and one of them is thought to have been a Syrian who entered Europe via Greece with migrants. Millions of Syrians have fled to neighbouring countries and to Europe, and the US has promised to take about 10,000 Syrian refugees in the next 12 months. States saying no While the state of Alabama has not accepted any Syrian refugees so far, the southern state's governor has said that he "will not place Alabamians at even the slightest possible risk of an attack on our people". In Michigan, where it has been reported that 200 Syrians have been resettled in the past year, Governor Snyder has said he will suspend the acceptance of new refugees until the US Department of Homeland Security "completes a full review of security clearances and procedures". At the scene: Suzanne Kianpour, BBC News Washington US State Department lawyers are investigating whether governors can legally block Syrian refugees from being settled in their states. While the final ruling has not been made, officials say it appears they can't actually block refugees who come into the country through the resettlement program, but they can make it difficult for the non-profit organisations doing the legwork. A state can tell an NGO handling a file that they don't want to work with them and the NGO would simply go elsewhere. But uneasiness about the vetting process and fear of a similar attack in the US is growing, especially on Capitol Hill. The decision to suspend the acceptance of refugees has drawn the ire of some working to resettle them. "It's vital to keep in mind those who are refugees are fleeing persecution," said Michael Mitchell, with the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, an organisation working to resettle refugees in the US. But several Republican presidential candidates have said it would be wrong to accept any more. Business mogul Donald Trump described it as "insane". The three top Democratic candidates have said they want the US to take more than 10,000 Syrian refugees but only after extensive vetting. On Monday it was reported that a new video released by the so-called Islamic State celebrates the attacks and threatens Washington, DC. Flags on many public buildings across the US are flying at half-mast as an expression of solidarity with France. Syrian refugees in Kentucky
By Matthew Hill, David Campanale and Joel GunterBBC News The men always wore masks, Tursunay Ziawudun said, even though there was no pandemic then. They wore suits, she said, not police uniforms. Sometime after midnight, they came to the cells to select the women they wanted and took them down the corridor to a "black room", where there were no surveillance cameras. Several nights, Ziawudun said, they took her. "Perhaps this is the most unforgettable scar on me forever," she said. "I don't even want these words to spill from my mouth." Tursunay Ziawudun spent nine months inside China's vast and secretive system of internment camps in the Xinjiang region. According to independent estimates, more than a million men and women have been detained in the sprawling network of camps, which China says exist for the "re-education" of the Uighurs and other minorities. Human rights groups say the Chinese government has gradually stripped away the religious and other freedoms of the Uighurs, culminating in an oppressive system of mass surveillance, detention, indoctrination, and even forced sterilisation. The policy flows from China's President, Xi Jinping, who visited Xinjiang in 2014 in the wake of a terror attack by Uighur separatists. Shortly after, according to documents leaked to the New York Times, he directed local officials to respond with "absolutely no mercy". The US government said last month that China's actions since amounted to a genocide. China says reports of mass detention and forced sterilisation are "lies and absurd allegations". First-hand accounts from inside the internment camps are rare, but several former detainees and a guard have told the BBC they experienced or saw evidence of an organised system of mass rape, sexual abuse and torture. Tursunay Ziawudun, who fled Xinjiang after her release and is now in the US, said women were removed from the cells "every night" and raped by one or more masked Chinese men. She said she was tortured and later gang-raped on three occasions, each time by two or three men. Ziawudun has spoken to the media before, but only from Kazakhstan, where she "lived in constant fear of being sent back to China", she said. She said she believed that if she revealed the extent of the sexual abuse she had experienced and seen, and was returned to Xinjiang, she would be punished more harshly than before. And she was ashamed, she said. It is impossible to verify Ziawudun's account completely because of the severe restrictions China places on reporters in the country, but travel documents and immigration records she provided to the BBC corroborate the timeline of her story. Her descriptions of the camp in Xinyuan county - known in Uighur as Kunes county - match satellite imagery analysed by the BBC, and her descriptions of daily life inside the camp, as well as the nature and methods of the abuse, correspond with other accounts from former detainees. Internal documents from the Kunes county justice system from 2017 and 2018, provided to the BBC by Adrian Zenz, a leading expert on China's policies in Xinjiang, detail planning and spending for "transformation through education" of "key groups" - a common euphemism in China for the indoctrination of the Uighurs. In one Kunes document, the "education" process is described as "washing brains, cleansing hearts, strengthening righteousness and eliminating evil". The BBC also interviewed a Kazakh woman from Xinjiang who was detained for 18 months in the camp system, who said she was forced to strip Uighur women naked and handcuff them, before leaving them alone with Chinese men. Afterwards, she cleaned the rooms, she said. "My job was to remove their clothes above the waist and handcuff them so they cannot move," said Gulzira Auelkhan, crossing her wrists behind her head to demonstrate. "Then I would leave the women in the room and a man would enter - some Chinese man from outside or policeman. I sat silently next to the door, and when the man left the room I took the woman for a shower." The Chinese men "would pay money to have their pick of the prettiest young inmates", she said. Some former detainees of the camps have described being forced to assist guards or face punishment. Auelkhan said she was powerless to resist or intervene. Asked if there was a system of organised rape, she said: "Yes, rape." "They forced me to go into that room," she said. "They forced me to take off those women's clothes and to restrain their hands and leave the room." Some of the women who were taken away from the cells at night were never returned, Ziawudun said. Those who were brought back were threatened against telling others in the cell what had happened to them. "You can't tell anyone what happened, you can only lie down quietly," she said. "It is designed to destroy everyone's spirit." Mr Zenz told the BBC that the testimony gathered for this story was "some of the most horrendous evidence I have seen since the atrocity began". "This confirms the very worst of what we have heard before," he said. "It provides authoritative and detailed evidence of sexual abuse and torture at a level clearly greater than what we had assumed." The Uighurs are a mostly Muslim Turkic minority group that number about 11 million in Xinjiang in north-western China. The region borders Kazakhstan and is also home to ethnic Kazakhs. Ziawudun, who is 42, is Uighur. Her husband is a Kazakh. The couple returned to Xinjiang in late 2016 after a five-year stay in Kazakhstan, and were interrogated on arrival and had their passports confiscated, Ziawudun said. A few months later, she was told by police to attend a meeting alongside other Uighurs and Kazakhs and the group was rounded up and detained. Her first stint in detention was comparatively easy, she said, with decent food and access to her phone. After a month she developed stomach ulcers and was released. Her husband's passport was returned and he went back to Kazakhstan to work, but authorities kept Ziawudun's, trapping her in Xinjiang. Reports suggest China has purposefully kept behind and interned relatives to discourage those who leave from speaking out. On 9 March 2018, with her husband still in Kazakhstan, Ziawudun was instructed to report to a local police station, she said. She was told she needed "more education". According to her account, Ziawudun was transported back to the same facility as her previous detention, in Kunes county, but the site had been significantly developed, she said. Buses were lined up outside offloading new detainees "non-stop". The women had their jewellery confiscated. Ziawudun's earrings were yanked out, she said, causing her ears to bleed, and she was herded into a room with a group of women. Among them was an elderly woman who Ziawudun would later befriend. The camp guards pulled off the woman's headscarf, Ziawudun said, and shouted at her for wearing a long dress - one of a list of religious expressions that became arrestable offences for Uighurs that year. "They stripped everything off the elderly lady, leaving her with just her underwear. She was so embarrassed that she tried to cover herself with her arms," Ziawudun said. "I cried so much watching the way they treated her. Her tears fell like rain." The women were told to hand over their shoes and any clothes with elastic or buttons, Ziawudun said, then taken to cellblocks - "similar to a small Chinese neighbourhood where there are rows of buildings". Nothing much happened for the first month or two. They were forced to watch propaganda programmes in their cells and had their hair forcibly cut short. Then police began interrogating Ziawudun about her absent husband, she said, knocking her on the floor when she resisted and kicking her in the abdomen. "Police boots are very hard and heavy, so at first I thought he was beating me with something," she said. "Then I realised that he was trampling on my belly. I almost passed out - I felt a hot flush go through me." A camp doctor told her she might have a blood clot. When her cellmates drew attention to the fact that she was bleeding, the guards "replied saying it is normal for women to bleed", she said. According to Ziawudun, each cell was home to 14 women, with bunk beds, bars on the windows, a basin and a hole-in-the-floor-style toilet. When she first saw women being taken out of the cell at night, she didn't understand why, she said. She thought they were being moved elsewhere. Then sometime in May 2018 - "I don't remember the exact date, because you don't remember the dates inside there" - Ziawudun and a cellmate, a woman in her twenties, were taken out at night and presented to a Chinese man in a mask, she said. Her cellmate was taken into a separate room. "As soon as she went inside she started screaming," Ziawudun said. "I don't know how to explain to you, I thought they were torturing her. I never thought about them raping." The woman who had brought them from the cells told the men about Ziawudun's recent bleeding. "After the woman spoke about my condition, the Chinese man swore at her. The man with the mask said 'Take her to the dark room'. "The woman took me to the room next to where the other girl had been taken in. They had an electric stick, I didn't know what it was, and it was pushed inside my genital tract, torturing me with an electric shock." Ziawudun's torture that first night in the dark room eventually came to an end, she said, when the woman intervened again citing her medical condition, and she was returned to the cell. About an hour later, her cellmate was brought back. "The girl became completely different after that, she wouldn't speak to anyone, she sat quietly staring as if in a trance," Ziawudun said. "There were many people in those cells who lost their minds." Alongside cells, another central feature of the camps is classrooms. Teachers have been drafted in to "re-educate" the detainees - a process activists say is designed to strip the Uighurs and other minorities of their culture, language and religion, and indoctrinate them into mainstream Chinese culture. Qelbinur Sedik, an Uzbek woman from Xinjiang, was among the Chinese language teachers brought into the camps and coerced into giving lessons to the detainees. Sedik has since fled China and spoken publicly about her experience. The women's camp was "tightly controlled", Sedik told the BBC. But she heard stories, she said - signs and rumours of rape. One day, Sedik cautiously approached a Chinese camp policewoman she knew. "I asked her, 'I have been hearing some terrible stories about rape, do you know about it?' She said we should talk in the courtyard during lunch. "So I went to the courtyard, where there were not many cameras. She said, 'Yes, the rape has become a culture. It is gang rape and the Chinese police not only rape them but also electrocute them. They are subject to horrific torture.'" That night Sedik didn't sleep at all, she said. "I was thinking about my daughter who was studying abroad and I cried all night." In separate testimony to the Uyghur Human Rights Project, Sedik said she heard about an electrified stick being inserted into women to torture them - echoing the experience Ziawudun described. There were "four kinds of electric shock", Sedik said - "the chair, the glove, the helmet, and anal rape with a stick". "The screams echoed throughout the building," she said. "I could hear them during lunch and sometimes when I was in class." Another teacher forced to work in the camps, Sayragul Sauytbay, told the BBC that "rape was common" and the guards "picked the girls and young women they wanted and took them away". She described witnessing a harrowing public gang rape of a woman of just 20 or 21, who was brought before about 100 other detainees to make a forced confession. "After that, in front of everyone, the police took turns to rape her," Sauytbay said. "While carrying out this test, they watched people closely and picked out anyone who resisted, clenched their fists, closed their eyes, or looked away, and took them for punishment." The young woman cried out for help, Sauytbay said. "It was absolutely horrendous," she said. "I felt I had died. I was dead." In the camp in Kunes, Ziawudun's days drifted into weeks and then months. The detainees' hair was cut, they went to class, they underwent unexplained medical tests, took pills, and were forcibly injected every 15 days with a "vaccine" that brought on nausea and numbness. Women were forcibly fitted with IUDs or sterilised, Ziawudun said, including a woman who was just about 20 years old. ("We begged them on her behalf," she said.) Forced sterilisation of Uighurs has been widespread in Xinjiang, according to a recent investigation by the Associated Press. The Chinese government told the BBC the allegations were "completely unfounded". As well as the medical interventions, detainees in Ziawudun's camp spent hours singing patriotic Chinese songs and watching patriotic TV programmes about Chinese President Xi Jinping, she said. "You forget to think about life outside the camp. I don't know if they brainwashed us or if it was the side effect of the injections and pills, but you can't think of anything beyond wishing you had a full stomach. The food deprivation is so severe." Detainees had food withheld for infractions such as failing to accurately memorise passages from books about Xi Jinping, according to a former camp guard who spoke to the BBC via video link from a country outside China. "Once we were taking the people arrested into the concentration camp, and I saw everyone being forced to memorise those books. They sit for hours trying to memorise the text, everyone had a book in their hands," he said. Those who failed tests were forced to wear three different colours of clothing based on whether they had failed one, two, or three times, he said, and subjected to different levels of punishment accordingly, including food deprivation and beatings. "I entered those camps. I took detainees into those camps," he said. "I saw those sick, miserable people. They definitely experienced various types of torture. I am sure about that." It was not possible to independently verify the guard's testimony but he provided documents that appeared to corroborate a period of employment at a known camp. He agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. The guard said he did not know anything about rape in the cell areas. Asked if the camp guards used electrocution, he said: "Yes. They do. They use those electrocuting instruments." After being tortured, detainees were forced to make confessions to a variety of perceived offences, according to the guard. "I have those confessions in my heart," he said. President Xi looms large over the camps. His image and slogans adorn the walls; he is a focus of the programme of "re-education". Xi is the overall architect of the policy against the Uighurs, said Charles Parton, a former British diplomat in China and now senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute. "It is very centralised and it goes to the very top," Parton said. "There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that this is Xi Jinping's policy." It was unlikely that Xi or other top party officials would have directed or authorised rape or torture, Parton said, but they would "certainly be aware of it". "I think they prefer at the top just to turn a blind eye. The line has gone out to implement this policy with great sternness, and that is what is happening." That left "no real constraints", he said. "I just don't see what the perpetrators of these acts would have to hold them back." According to Ziawudun's account, the perpetrators did not hold back. "They don't only rape but also bite all over your body, you don't know if they are human or animal," she said, pressing a tissue to her eyes to stop her tears and pausing for a long time to collect herself. "They didn't spare any part of the body, they bit everywhere leaving horrible marks. It was disgusting to look at. "I've experienced that three times. And it is not just one person who torments you, not just one predator. Each time they were two or three men." Later, a woman who slept near Ziawudun in the cell, who said she was detained for giving birth to too many children, disappeared for three days and when she returned her body was covered with the same marks, Ziawudun said. "She couldn't say it. She wrapped her arms around my neck and sobbed continuously, but she said nothing." The Chinese government did not respond directly to questions from the BBC about allegations of rape and torture. In a statement, a spokeswoman said the camps in Xinjiang were not detention camps but "vocational education and training centres". "The Chinese government protects the rights and interests of all ethnic minorities equally," the spokeswoman said, adding that the government "attaches great importance to protecting women's rights". Ziawudun was released in December 2018 along with others who had spouses or relatives in Kazakhstan - an apparent policy shift she still doesn't fully understand. The state returned her passport and she fled to Kazakhstan and then, with the support of the Uyghur Human Rights Project, to the US. She is applying to stay. She lives in a quiet suburb not far from Washington DC with a landlady from the local Uighur community. The two women cook together and take walks in the streets around the house. It's a slow, uneventful existence. Ziawudun keeps the lights low when she is in the house, because they shone brightly and constantly in the camp. A week after she arrived in the US, she had surgery to remove her womb - a consequence of being stamped on. "I have lost the chance to become a mother," she said. She wants her husband to join her in the US. For now, he is in Kazakhstan. For a while after her release, before she could flee, Ziawudun waited in Xinjiang. She saw others who had been churned through the system and released. She saw the effect the policy was having on her people. The birth rate in Xinjiang has plummeted in the past few years, according to independent research - an effect analysts have described as "demographic genocide". Many in the community had turned to alcohol, Ziawudun said. Several times, she saw her former cellmate collapsed on the street - the young woman who was removed from the cell with her that first night, who she heard screaming in an adjacent room. The woman had been consumed by addiction, Ziawudun said. She was "like someone who simply existed, otherwise she was dead, completely finished by the rapes". "They say people are released, but in my opinion everyone who leaves the camps is finished." And that, she said, was the plan. The surveillance, the internment, the indoctrination, the dehumanisation, the sterilisation, the torture, the rape. "Their goal is to destroy everyone," she said. "And everybody knows it."

Glenn Ford, 64, had been on death row since August 1988. He had been found guilty of killing 56-year-old Isadore Rozeman, a jeweller for whom Mr Ford occasionally worked. US media reports say that he is one of the longest-serving death row inmates in modern US history to be exonerated. Mr Ford had always denied killing Mr Rozeman. 'Very pleased' Asked by a reporter how he was feeling as he left the high security prison in Angola, Louisiana, Mr Ford said: "My mind is going in all kinds of directions but it feels good." He said that he did harbour some resentment because he had been locked up for almost 30 years "for something I didn't do" and had lost years of his life. "Thirty years, 30 years of my life if not all of it. I can't go back and do anything that I should've been doing when I was 35, 38 and 40 - stuff like that. My son when I left was a baby, now they're grown men with babies." State District Judge Ramona Emanuel on Monday overturned Mr Ford's conviction and sentence because of new information that supported his claim that he was not present or involved in Mr Rozeman's death, Mr Ford's lawyers said. He was convicted over the 1983 killing and sentenced to death. "We are very pleased to see Glenn Ford finally exonerated, and we are particularly grateful that the prosecution and the court moved ahead so decisively to set Mr Ford free," a statement by the freed man's lawyers said. They said that his trial had been "compromised by inexperienced counsel and by the unconstitutional suppression of evidence, including information from an informant". They also drew attention to what they said was a suppressed police report related to the time of the crime and evidence involving the murder weapon. The family of the murder victim have also welcomed his release, US media has reported. The many flaws in the case against Mr Ford have been listed by the US press: There are 83 men and two women serving death sentences in Louisiana. State law entitles those who have served time but are later exonerated to receive compensation. It sets out payments of $25,000 (£15,000) per year of wrongful incarceration up to a maximum of $250,000 (£150,000), plus up to $80,000 (£48,000) for loss of "life opportunities".
Germany's Interior Minister, Thomas de Maiziere, said "many things" pointed to a deliberate attack. Police said on Twitter that the lorry driver had been arrested, and that a passenger died from his injuries. The market is at Breitscheidplatz, close to the Kurfuerstendamm, the main shopping street in the city's west. Almost 50 people are in hospital and at least four have suffered serious injuries. Facebook set up a "Safety Check" page for people in Berlin to let others know they are safe. Attack as it happened Security sources cited by the German news agency DPA said that the driver of the truck was an asylum seeker from Afghanistan or Pakistan who had arrived in Germany in February. Berlin police spokesman Winfried Wenzel said a suspect believed to be the person driving the vehicle was picked up about a mile (2 kilometres) away from the crash site, near Berlin's Victory Column monument, and was being interrogated. Images of the lorry show that it was registered in neighbouring Poland. Police believe it may have been stolen from a construction site there. Police said the passenger who died was Polish. Ariel Zurawski, the Polish owner of the lorry, confirmed that his driver was missing and had been unreachable since 16:00 (15:00 GMT) on Monday. "We haven't heard from him since this afternoon," he told the AFP news agency. "We don't know what happened to him. He's my cousin, I've known him since I was a kid. I can vouch for him." Was it a terror attack? German politicians have been unwilling to call the deadly crash a terrorist attack at this stage, while many of the details remain unverified or unclear. Interior Minister Mr de Maiziere told ARD television: "I don't want to use the word 'attack' yet at the moment, although many things speak for it. "There is a psychological effect in the whole country of the choice of words here, and we want to be very, very cautious and operate close to the actual investigation results, not with speculation." Chancellor Angela Merkel has been briefed by the interior minister and the mayor of Berlin, her spokesman Steffen Seibert tweeted. "We are in mourning for the dead and hope that the many injured can get help," he added. German President Joachim Gauck said in a statement that Monday was an "awful evening for Berlin and for our country". The truck, which was loaded with steel beams, veered into the Christmas market at one of the most crowded times, crashing through wooden huts and stands filled with tourists and locals. According to the DPA news agency, police believe the lorry drove 50-80 metres (54-87 yards) through the market area during the incident, which occurred at 20:14 local time (19:14 GMT). A British eyewitness, Mike Fox, told Associated Press at the scene that the large lorry had missed him by only about 3m as it smashed through stands and tore down a large Christmas tree. "It was definitely deliberate," said the tourist, visiting from Birmingham. He said he had helped people who appeared to have broken limbs, and that others were trapped under Christmas stands. Australian Trisha O'Neill told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she witnessed "blood and bodies everywhere". "I just saw this huge black truck speeding through the markets crushing so many people and then all the lights went out and everything was destroyed. "I could hear screaming and then we all froze. Then suddenly people started to move and lift all the wreckage off people, trying to help whoever was there." The site where the chaos unfolded is near a famous Berlin landmark - the Gedaechtniskirche, or memorial church, built in 1891-95. The church was damaged in World War Two bombing raids, and left as a ruin with a jagged tower as a monument to peace and reconciliation. Memories of Nice A series of small-scale attacks by Islamist militants alarmed Germany earlier this year. Monday's incident evoked memories of the lorry attack on Bastille Day crowds in the French city of Nice on 14 July, when 86 people were killed. That attack was claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS). Both IS and al-Qaida have urged their followers to use trucks as a means to attack crowds. Reacting to the news from Berlin, Nice Mayor Christian Estrosi tweeted: "Horror in Berlin. Support for the mayor of Berlin and the German people. never again." The United States labelled the tragedy an apparent "terrorist attack" and pledged its support. President-elect Donald Trump blamed "Islamist terrorists" for a "slaughter" of Christians in the German capital. "Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse. The civilized world must change thinking!" he tweeted. Are you in the area?

Mr Cook made his announcement to try to help people struggling with their identity, he wrote in a Bloomberg Businessweek article. He has been open about his sexuality, but has also tried to maintain a basic level of privacy until now, he said. This week Mr Cook challenged his home state of Alabama to ensure the rights of gay and transgender people. Privacy trade-off "While I have never denied my sexuality, I haven't publicly acknowledged it either, until now," he wrote. "So let me be clear: I'm proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me," he added. He said he didn't consider himself an activist, but that he realised he had "benefited from the sacrifice of others." "So if hearing that the CEO [chief executive] of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it's worth the trade-off with my own privacy," he added. Mr Cook said that he had been open about his sexuality with many people, including colleagues at Apple, but that it still "wasn't an easy choice" to publicly announce his sexual orientation. He quoted civil rights campaigner Martin Luther King, saying: "Life's most persistent and urgent question is, 'What are you doing for others?' " Analysis Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC News technology correspondent Tim Cook's announcement may come as no surprise in Silicon Valley or across corporate America. But that does not mean that we should underestimate the significance of the leader of the world's most valuable company talking openly about his sexuality. Back in May, a piece in the New York Times asked "where are the gay chief executives?" and struggled to name any openly gay CEOs at America's 1,000 biggest companies. Apple under Steve Jobs was not a company that took a stand on any issues which were not seen as relevant to its business. Tim Cook has been more forthcoming on all sorts of issues, including equal rights for gay workers, and while he says he does not see himself as an activist, that is how many will now see him. That could embroil him in controversy in the United States, let alone in other parts of the world with less liberal views of sexuality. Mr Cook admitted that going public as a gay man was not an easy choice - but it certainly looks a courageous one. This week Mr Cook referred to Martin Luther King in a speech in Alabama in which he called for equal rights for people based on sexual orientation and identity. He said that Alabama had been too slow to ensure the rights of ethnic minorities in the civil rights era, and was now being too slow to guarantee gay rights. "Under the law, citizens of Alabama can still be fired based on their sexual orientation," Mr Cook said. "We can't change the past, but we can learn from it and we can create a different future." Mr Cook has championed equality at Apple, but in August said he was "not satisfied" with workforce diversity at the company. Outstanding, a not-for-profit professional network for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) executives, said on Thursday that many LGBT people in the UK felt it was "safer to stay in the closet" when at work. In May a US study by LGBT organisation Human Rights Campaign suggested that 53% of US LGBT employees had not come out at work. 'Role model' Former BP chief executive Lord Browne, who now chairs fracking company Cuadrilla, said Mr Cook had become a role model. "By deciding to speak publicly about his sexuality, Tim Cook has become a role model, and will speed up changes in the corporate world," Lord Browne said. The peer kept his sexual orientation a secret for decades, but was forced to come out after a boyfriend made his sexuality public in 2007. Lord Browne later resigned after losing a court battle with a newspaper.
The Queen is expected to arrive in France on 5 June and spend the following day in Normandy for the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings. She will then travel on to Paris, with Prince Philip. The Queen, who last made a state visit to France in April 2004, was invited by France's president Francois Hollande. In a short statement, the palace said: "The Queen, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh, will make a state visit to France from 5 to 7 June. "Her Majesty and His Royal Highness are visiting at the invitation of the President of France, President Hollande. "On 6 June the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will attend events in Normandy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings. "On 6 and 7 June Her Majesty and His Royal Highness will attend state visit events in Paris and be received at the Elysee Palace by President Hollande."
The current maximum sentence for owners who allow their animal to attack members of the public is two years. BBC News website readers have been sending in their comments and experiences. Eleanor Burke, London I was going to Cricklewood station when my guide dog Neela was attacked by a pitbull terrier. It latched onto the right-hand side of her neck. It was terrifying. I'm very reliant on Neela. Without her I can just see light and dark and shadows - she is my means of getting around. I could hear the most important thing in my life getting attacked and I could do nothing. What's worse is that she has been trained not to retaliate. When the owner came along he tried to kick the dog and then he ran off and tried to get her to follow - neither seemed to work. Neela had 10 puncture wounds on the side of her neck. She was in a very bad way. While she was recovering I couldn't leave the house for a week. It damaged my confidence and her confidence too. The owner was sentenced to a 10-year ban from owning dogs and 150 hours' community service. He was also ordered to pay £500 in compensation to me and £1,200 to the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association. I didn't receive any money and I don't think that the Guide Dogs did as he appealed the sentence. An attack on a guide dog should be treated as seriously as an attack on a human being - like it is in Northern Ireland. There should also be prison sentences after serious attacks too. We've got children being mauled to death and not enough is being done. Lisa Herrett, Essex I was bitten about a year ago by a Rottweiler. The dog belongs to my brother's in-laws who he lives with. You have to walk through the garden to get to the house and even though I'd been told that the dogs wouldn't attack if you were with a family member, the dogs charged us. They have a Rottweiler, a husky and a bulldog. They're not trained. I was bitten on the backside and it was so painful. I was really scared. It broke the skin. I phoned my husband who was furious and he rang the police who said they could do nothing because it was on private property. We had no apology from the owners; they just said the dogs were protecting the property. They're on about an acre of garden and they don't take them out on the lead so they have free reign of the place. I signed the e-petition after Jade Anderson was killed. I was only bitten and that was painful enough. I can't imagine what it must be like for some of these children who are mauled. The law is a joke and this country is full of irresponsible dog owners. Dog owners should have to take responsibility for the actions of their pets if they are un-muzzled and attack even if in their own homes. Andy Wilson, Essex It's the dog not the owner. I train all sorts of aggressive dogs from Great Danes to chihuahuas. I know there are very few people who use aggressive dogs as a status symbol or weapon, however, most people with aggressive dogs are very responsible but don't know how to fix the problem. Most of the time they don't know their dogs can learn to behave socially. It seems you either have a social dog and are responsible or an aggressive dog and you are a thug. Most people just need help We hold two very successful training classes set up specifically to fix aggression. Educating the handler and owners will make a massive difference to the way dogs behave. Muzzles take teeth out of the equation. Take the stigma away and more muzzles would be used. Teresa Armstrong, Surrey My dog was attacked, although not badly, by a Staffordshire bull terrier, and the owner did nothing. I know the guy who owns it. He was 200 yards away when it happened. He had two dogs and it was his black-and-white Staff who attacked my border collie. I've told people to keep away from him. I think all dogs should be licensed and neutered to prevent more dogs getting onto our streets. Kids are seen walking dogs far too strong and lethally dangerous for them to control. I think dogs should be under a responsible supervised adult's control. Far too many dogs are bred by irresponsible people purely for the money. A dog should not be a weapon or a status symbol. Dogs are lovely animals and with the right owners, good to have around. Interviews by Victoria Park and Sally Taft
Dominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent@BBCDomCon Twitter He was born as Adrian Russell Elms at Hainault Maternity Hospital, Erith, south-east London, on Christmas Day in 1964. His father played no part in the newborn's life - and when his mother Janet married two years later, the boy was given his step-father's surname, Ajao. The future killer would use the surnames interchangeably as an adult, before he converted to Islam and became Masood. His mother and her husband lived for a while in south London and Adrian was at school in Lewisham until he was 13. His parents went on to have two more sons. He then he moved to Tunbridge Wells, Kent, with his two half-brothers. Adrian attended Huntleys School for Boys, having failed to secure a place at grammar school. In 2013, Masood sent an angry bitter email to his mother about his childhood - and his disappointment with his schooling. "I remember that email," Mrs Ajao told the inquests. "I have spent a long time thinking what did I do wrong… What should I have done." His parents later moved to rural Carmarthenshire - and after many years of being estranged from them, Masood visited one last time in the days before his attack. He left that last meeting, telling his mother, "They will say I am a terrorist - but I am not." First offending Masood's first offending came when he was arrested aged 14 for shoplifting and given a police caution. His mother had sent him out to buy stationery for school - and told the inquests she could not understand why he had not used the money she had provided. He left school at 16 and and studied for a BTEC in business studies at a local college. And as he entered his later teenage years, his temper developed. His two brothers told police Masood was "a violent but clever person who wouldn't back down from a disagreement". His mother later told police that she had come to believe years earlier that he could end up killing someone. And that refusal to back down would lead him into a life of violence. Detective Chief Inspector Dan Brown was in charge of the Metropolitan Police's operation to establish Masood's background "He would go out locally to pubs and clubs and his mother believes that Masood would go looking for a fight after drinking," he told the inquests. Despite this violence, his working life appeared to begin well. He was taken on to as a trainee manager for the now-defunct department store Woolworths, and moved to Hastings. But in October 1983, aged 18, he was convicted of criminal damage and fined £15. He later walked out of Woolworths and in 1988, when he was 23-years-old, he was arrested in possession of an offensive weapons and for threatening behaviour. Later he got into a row on a bus, leading to arrest for assault causing bodily harm. Then in 1990 he ripped a telephone from a wall in a restaurant and began to fight officers trying to arrest him. Adrian Ajao began his first serious relationship the same year after meeting Jane Harvey in Tunbridge Wells. They would go on to have two children and lived in the village of Northiam, East Sussex. She later told police he was powerful, charming and intelligent - but she would be scared when he was drunk - and they separated once after he hurt her in an incident. Four years into the relationship, he enrolled at The University of Sussex and graduated with a degree in economics - but his hopes of a career in finance was blocked by his criminal record. So he began working for his partner's firm, staying there until a more serious act of violence led to prison. In 2000, he became embroiled in a serious pub attack following a row, which he later claimed was triggered by racism. He lost his temper with Piers Mott, slashing him on his face and leaving an 8cm gash on his left cheek. Mr Mott has since died, but his widow Heather recalled the incident. "My husband was defending someone who was working for him," she said. "I don't know how it happened - Piers was just defending this guy." Elms/Ajao was jailed for two years and spent time in HMP Lewis, Wayland and Ford. He never returned to live in the village. This was the turning point in his life. Elms knew he was violent and dangerous - he pleaded guilty to the attack - and his partner left him. In prison, he began reading the Koran, apparently encouraged by a visiting imam who may have been called Khalid. Adrian Ajao began the transition to Khalid Masood. After his release from jail in the summer of 2001, he moved to Eastbourne - where a man who knew him as a casual acquaintance told the BBC Elms used both cocaine and bodybuilding steroids. And he was still violent. He was fined after assaulting a girlfriend - and in 2001 took part in a major pub fight. "I first met him in a pub around Christmas Eve 2001," the former electrician told the BBC. "He was introduced as 'Black Ady'. "Everyone who met him said he was really polite, but he was in a pub one night and two guys were playing pool. "Something was said and he battered them both with pool cues." The assaults didn't lead to prosecutions - and detectives believed that the suspect had intimidated the victims. "One time I noticed a Koran and I made a joke like: 'Are you reading that?' He did not seem the religious type at all," said the friend. "I spoke to my friend who lived with him for a while and he said he used to read the Koran all the time. "The next time I saw him it was summer 2002 - he was on steroids, though he wasn't huge. "He took quite a lot of cocaine and he seemed to like women with pink hair. He had one girlfriend and she had silicone breasts." When Elms and the acquaintance mistakenly thought they were dating the same woman - Elms suggested that if they weren't friends, he would stab him in the face. Attempted murder Sussex Police received reports of at least two other acts of violence in 2002 and 2003. Detective Constable Stuart Black from Sussex Police came across Khalid Masood in the critical period. "He was trying to increase his reputation and status," DC Brown told the Westminster Bridge inquests. "Eastbourne is only a small town, and he was just trying to big it up in a small town." In 2003 the future killer attacked a man called Daniel Smith. "The injuries were probably the worst knife injuries I've actually seen," said the detective. After some kind of row over whether or not he was an undercover police officer, Masood began the attack to prove he wasn't. He lunged at Mr Smith and plunged a knife through his nose. It went through the palate of his mouth, his tongue and into his jawbone. Masood was arrested and charged with attempted murder. DC Black recalled that during the interview, the suspect was "extremely confident to the point of cocky". At trial, he claimed self defence and was acquitted. The judge, according to accounts, was amazed. Despite a six-month sentence for the additional offence of carrying the weapon, the attacker had to be released straight away because he had spent that period on remand. Approaching 40 years old, he had escaped a major prison sentence. And that sealed his belief in God. He later told others that he had experienced two miracles in his life. One was his daughter's recovery after a serious car accident. The other was his acquittal for attempted murder. Filled with religious zeal, he would call his mother to lecture her. "He had met someone in prison who had advised or explained to him [the faith]," Mrs Ajao told the inquests. "He would telephone - he would never stop talking about it - go on and on and on. I would put the phone down, walk across the room and make a cup of tea and he would still be going on." What happened next is a little unclear. Police believe that the new convert briefly went to Saudi Arabia. By 2004 he was living in Crawley and using his new name all the time. He legally changed it in May of the following year. In September 2004 he married Farzana Malik, a Pakistani-heritage Muslim woman in Crawley, West Sussex. The relationship was an utter disaster because Masood was becoming more extreme in his views. "When I visited in the New Year there was an atmosphere," said Mrs Ajao. "I could feel that Farzana was separate from Adrian. It did not feel right to me. He said later he had five rules that he would like her to follow. What I felt at the time that he was too strict with these rules." Those rules included trying to control what she watched on TV and whether she met non-Muslims. What we have now learned is that during this critical period of being a new Muslim, Masood expose himself to the extreme worldview propagated by followers of a now-banned terrorism network. Crawley was then a centre of activity for Al Muhajiroun, the network later headed by the jailed preacher, Anjem Choudary. At the inquests, it emerged that Khalid Masood knew two Crawley members of the network who became involved in violence thousands of miles apart. The first was Waheed Mahmood, sentenced to life in 2007 for his part in the UK's then biggest bomb plot. The second was Waheed Majeed who became the first suicide bomber from the UK in the Syrian civil war. Masood and his wife split up - and in November 2005 he left to work as an English teacher in Saudi Arabia. In late 2006 he returned home and met, and later married, his final wife, Rohey Hydara. Masood worked twice more in Saudi Arabia before finally settling in Luton to teach English there to foreign students. During this period, the evidence suggests that Masood case to associate with more members of the al-Muhajiroun network. Luton was constantly targeted by the terror group - and Masood went to the same gym as a man who would later flee the UK while under investigation to fight in Syria. Eventually, Masood, his wife and their two children, settled in Birmingham - but they were effectively living separate lives by the time of his attack. He had become more and more extreme in his views, criticising her for wearing trousers and lecturing her about the Islamic State group. In late 2016, all the evidence indicates that Masood wanted to return yet again to Saudi Arabia - but his visa application was rejected, possibly because of his criminal record. Frustrated, this may have the significant final event in his road to becoming a killer in March 2017. Unbeknown at the time to their mother, Masood had a number of video calls with his young children. In some, he talked about dreams he'd experienced - and he told the children - too young to understand what it would come to mean - that he believed he was going to die fighting for God.
Officials said on Monday that Reyhaneh Jabbari, 26, had been transferred to a prison west of Tehran to be hanged. But activists claimed on Tuesday that an online campaign had persuaded the state to give her a 10-day reprieve. The human rights group Amnesty International said she was convicted after a deeply flawed investigation. Ms Jabbari was arrested in 2007 for the murder of Morteza Abdolali Sarbandi, a former employee of Iran's Ministry of Intelligence. She was placed in solitary confinement for two months, where she reportedly did not have access to a lawyer or her family, and was sentenced to death by a criminal court in Tehran in 2009. Amnesty said that although Ms Jabbari admitted to stabbing Mr Abdolali Sarbandi once in the back, she alleged that there was someone else in the house who actually killed him. Her claim is believed to have never been properly investigated. Protest The authorities appeared to be pressing ahead with the execution on Monday, when they confirmed that Ms Jabbari had been transferred to Rajaishahr prison and would be hanged. A campaign calling for a halt to the execution was launched on Facebook and Twitter, using the hashtag #SaveReyhanehJabbari. Photographs of a protest outside the prison were also posted. On Tuesday, activists and bloggers reported that Ms Jabbari's execution appeared to have been postponed so that Mr Abdolali Sarbandi's family could be consulted. They cited a letter reportedly written by Ms Jabbari's mother, Sholeh Pakravanin, thanking people for their support and efforts to save her daughter's life. The development comes after activists said a former psychologist had been executed for "corruption on Earth and heresy in religion" near the city of Karaj on Wednesday. Mohsen Amir Aslani, 37, was arrested nine years ago after giving religious classes in which he provided his own interpretations of the Koran, they said. He was subsequently accused by the authorities of insulting the Prophet Jonah, the activists added. Iran's judiciary has denied that Mr Amir Aslani's execution was linked to his religious beliefs. Officials instead accused him of having had illicit sexual relationships with a number of people who attended his classes, the Guardian said.
Shaker Aamer was held at the US military base in Cuba over allegations he had led a Taliban unit and had met Osama Bin Laden, but was never charged. Downing Street said there were "no plans" to detain him after his arrival. Mr Aamer said he felt "obliged" to everyone who fought for him to be released, and to "bring an end to Guantanamo". "My thanks go to Allah first, second to my wife, my family, to my kids and then to my lawyers who did everything they could to carry the word to the world," he said. "I am overwhelmed by what people have done by their actions, their thoughts and their prayers, and without their devotion to justice I would not be here in Britain now." Concern has been raised over the health of the Saudi national, 48, whose family live in London, and the BBC witnessed an ambulance arrive at the airport. Number 10 said Prime Minister David Cameron "welcomes" the release of Mr Aamer, who has permission to live in the UK indefinitely because his wife is British. It also said any necessary security measures "will be put in place". The father-of-four landed at London's Biggin Hill Airport shortly before 13:00 GMT. Mr Aamer's father-in-law, Saeed Siddique, said his release was a "miracle". "It's a delightful day," he told BBC News while admitting it was also a "surprise". Mr Aamer, who was first held by US authorities in Afghanistan in 2001, maintains he was in the country doing charity work. Since 2007 Mr Aamer, who claims he was tortured, has been cleared for release twice, by US presidents George W Bush and then Barack Obama. It is understood Mr Aamer will go through standard immigration checks now he has arrived in the UK. Mr Aamer's legal representative Clive Stafford Smith told BBC News: "Shaker only wants the truth to come out he is not interested in persecuting anyone. "His first priority is health - he really is in terrible shape." In letters sent to the BBC by his lawyers earlier this month, Mr Aamer described himself as "an old car that has not been to the garage for years", saying the first thing he wanted once freed was a cup of coffee. Analysis By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent When the business jet carrying Shaker Aamer landed in London he was met by British officials. His lawyers say he will need urgent medical and mental assessments. He may, like others who have been held at Guantanamo, be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. While the PM has said Mr Aamer won't be detained, it's unlikely we will ever find out if MI5 separately decides to monitor him - by definition its work is secret. Mr Aamer is said to be relaxed about such prospects and has asked his lawyers to make clear he believes he has a "contract" to honour with the people of Britain. Shaker Aamer's return is the end of an astonishing and murky personal saga. But it's by no means the end of the story. The government's long-promised investigation into substantial allegations that our agencies became mixed up in rendition and torture - unwittingly or otherwise - hasn't happened. Shaker Aamer and many others want to know the truth. Who is Shaker Aamer? What now for Guantanamo detainee? Shaker Aamer in his own words 'Falsely imprisoned' Mr Aamer's release has been welcomed by some human rights groups and a number of MPs - but others say serious questions remain unanswered. Amnesty International said Mr Aamer's alleged torture in front of British agents in Afghanistan was a very serious claim that required investigation. Tory MP David Davis said he was keen to speak to Mr Aamer, saying: "When Mr Aamer is ready to talk, the Shaker Aamer All-Party Parliamentary Group, and I am sure many more MPs, look forward to seeing what he has to say about his detention." Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: "Shaker was simply a man in the wrong place at the wrong time, a charity worker building wells in Afghanistan who was kidnapped, ransomed and falsely imprisoned." But Robin Simcox, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society - a think tank which supports liberal democracies and an interventionist approach to foreign affairs - said: "Any joy and relief at his release must be tempered by the fact that this is someone who has had very serious questions posed of his past connections and conduct." Lawyer and journalist Jonathan Foreman told the BBC Mr Aamer's lack of a trial was "not so incredible" because he was "not detained in the same way as a criminal trial, he was detained on the battlefield as an unlawful combatant". 'Approved for transfer' Mr Aamer was detained in Afghanistan by bounty hunters tracking down and handing over possible al-Qaeda suspects, shortly after the 9/11 attacks in the US. He was detained on the same day his youngest son was born, and has never seen him. Mr Aamer was first held by US forces at Bagram air base, near Kabul, where his lawyers say he was tortured. They say he made false confessions to end his torture. In February 2002, Mr Aamer was transferred to Guantanamo Bay, where his lawyers say he suffered further abuse. The US Department of Defense said on Friday a review had been conducted of Mr Aamer's case. "As a result of that review, which examined a number of factors, including security issues, Aamer was unanimously approved for transfer." the statement said. Some 112 people are still being held at Guantanamo, which President Obama has promised to close, the statement confirmed. Guantanamo Bay is a US military prison in Cuba, set up during the "war on terror" in 2002 to detain what the US government called "enemy combatants". The first 20 detainees were transferred to the facility on 11 January of that year, and a total of 780 men have been held since then - the vast majority without charge or criminal trial.
The move comes just hours after the North renewed threats of military action at the Korean border. The site was opened in 2018 to help the Koreas - officially in a state of war - to communicate. It had been empty since January due to Covid-19 restrictions. In a statement, South Korea warned it would "respond strongly" if the North "continues to worsen the situation". The destruction of the office, it said, "abandons the hopes of everyone who wanted the development of inter-Korean relations and peace settlement in the Korean Peninsula". "The government makes it clear that all responsibility of this situation lies in the North." Russia expressed concern at the renewed tensions between the Koreas. "We call for restraint from all the sides," Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin, said on Tuesday. Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed senior US official as saying the Trump administration remained "in close co-ordination with our Republic of Korea (South Korea) allies". Tensions between North and South Korea have been escalating for weeks, prompted by defector groups in the South sending propaganda across the border. The North Korean leader's sister, Kim Yo-jong - considered a close and powerful ally - threatened at the weekend to demolish the office. Her brother, Kim Jong-un, has ruled North Korea as Supreme Leader since 2011. There were hopes for improved relations between the North and the South and its close ally the US after Donald Trump met Mr Kim at the North-South border last June, but nothing materialised and the atmosphere has since deteriorated. North Korea is under crippling US and UN economic sanctions over its militarised nuclear programme. Washington has not yet commented on the North's latest action. Pyongyang has blamed the escalation on Seoul's inability to prevent defectors from flying anti-regime propaganda over the border. But it is likely that this is just being used as an excuse. The leafleting gives a "cause" for North Koreans to rally around. It was notable that once again, in the aftermath of the explosion, state media made reference to "human scum" - their description of North Korean defectors in the South. Kim Jong-un has failed to bring economic prosperity to his people and strict international sanctions remain in place. There are also persistent rumours that Covid-19 has affected rural parts of the country. Giving North Koreans a mutual enemy may help focus their attention elsewhere. Pyongyang is also angry at Seoul for not challenging Washington's insistence that strict sanctions should remain in place and for not pursuing inter-Korean projects which would have breached both UN and US sanctions. It feels as if North Korea could be punishing the South and with the aim of using the tension as leverage in future talks. Whatever the reason, this is a real slap in the face for a South Korean administration that pushed so hard for engagement. In recent weeks, North Korea has repeatedly condemned the South for allowing propaganda into its territory. Defector groups regularly send such material via balloons, or even drones, into the North. Last Tuesday, Pyongyang announced it was severing official communication links with Seoul, and over the weekend Kim Yo-jong threatened to send troops into the demilitarised zone (DMZ) at the inter-Korean border. North and South Korea are technically still at war because no peace agreement was reached when the Korean War ended in 1953. What is the Kaesong liaison office? The border town of Kaesong has for years been a symbol of the fragile relationship between North and South Korea. In 2003, it sprung to life as the site of an industrial zone - the Kaesong Industrial Complex - set up between the North and South. At its peak, it saw more than 120 factories, employing more than 50,000 North Koreans and hundreds of managers from the South. But in 2016 it was shut down after tensions reached a head - bringing to a halt a symbol of co-operation. So, in 2018, it looked as though things were back on track when both Koreas agreed to set up an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong. It allowed officials from the North and South to communicate regularly for the first time since the Korean War, and was meant to be staffed by up to 20 people from each side. But in March 2019, North Korea announced that it was withdrawing from the office - following a failed summit between the US and North Korea. Who is Kim Yo-jong? In recent years the younger sister of Kim Jong-un has emerged as a powerful ally. From 2014, Kim Yo-jong's main job was to protect her brother's image, taking up a key role in the party's propaganda department. When, in 2017, she was elevated to an alternate member of the politburo, it seemed to indicate a shift in seniority - although her main role remained in propaganda. In 2018, she shot into the international spotlight when, at the Winter Olympics, she became the first member of the Kim family to visit South Korea. Her continued rise shows she has gained the deep trust of her brother, and when Mr Kim's disappearance in April prompted questions about his health, she was mentioned as a possible successor. In recent weeks, she has been responsible for delivering several strongly-worded messages against the South - and has emerged as North Korea's new point-person on inter-Korean affairs, according to specialist site NK News. However, North Korea's power mechanisms are notoriously difficult to understand. It's therefore hard to gauge how much power - or how much of her own political network - the 32-year-old might have.
Mr Osborne will loosen regulation to allow the move. Under an £8bn pilot scheme, London-based investors will be able to apply for a licence to use the Chinese currency to invest directly in Chinese shares and bonds. Until now, they have had to direct their investments via Hong Kong. Mr Osborne is also facilitating talks between Chinese banks and the UK banks regulator, the Prudential Regulation Authority, to allow them to establish branches for wholesale activities in London. This would allow China's huge banks to conduct business in London with companies and financial institutions, but not to offer High Street services. London is already the main overseas location for trading China's currency, known as the yuan or renminbi (RMB), with $5.3tn worth traded on an average day. But strict rules on transparency and cash reserve requirements have forced China to base its three biggest banks in Luxembourg. 'Jobs for Britain' Setting up the bank branches is good for China, as they would be able to operate under Chinese regulations. Mr Osborne said: "A great nation like China should have a great global currency." "Today we agreed the next big step in making London - already the global centre for finance - a major global centre for trading and now investing the Chinese currency, too." He said the move would mean more trade, investment, business and jobs for Britain. Discussions will begin between the Prudential Regulation Authority and Chinese banks in London. The announcement is part of the chancellor's visit to China this week. A joint statement from the two countries said both sides "welcomed this as an important step that cements London's major role as one of the most important global centres for RMB trading". On Monday, the chancellor announced a simplified application process for Chinese tourists wanting to visit the UK while in Europe.
The bank has 48,000 UK workers and will make cuts in both its retail and investment banking operations. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver said the jobs would go by "natural attrition". Staff turnover stood at about 3,000 annually. A total of 25,000 jobs could be axed globally, meaning close to 10% of HSBC's 266,000 workers will go. The bank will also rebrand its UK High Street branches but is yet to decide on a new name. Options could include reviving the Midland Bank brand, which it bought in 1992, or adopting the name of its UK online bank, First Direct. 'Treated fairly' Chief executive Stuart Gulliver said he wanted to ensure that customers made a distinction between HSBC's investment and retail banking operations. The bank is being forced by new government rules to formally separate the two businesses. Dominic Hook, national officer with the union Unite, called on HSBC to achieve any job cuts through voluntary means and natural attrition. "It's really sad that all our members, all the hard work they've done to try to get the bank back working properly after all the scandals of the last few years, are going to be paying with their jobs," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The number of UK branches is expected to fall by about 100 from 1,057 now. Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, business editor Tomorrow is the date of the Mansion House speech - George Osborne's annual summary of financial regulation and the City. The Chancellor could send a positive message to banks, saying that they are welcome in the UK and that regulation and the tax burden need to be "proportionate". That could pave the way to a reform of the bank levy so that it has less of an impact on the foreign operations of UK banks. That could be announced in the Budget on 8 July. The Chancellor could also decide not to raise the levy. Both would be welcomed by large global banks such as HSBC. BBC business editor Kamal Ahmed said the UK job cuts would come as a shock to staff: "Global banking now is a far tougher business than it was pre-the financial crisis. It is hard to get profits." Mr Gulliver was "running a bank that investors believe simply doesn't make enough money", he added. Our correspondent said the bank was now looking to "reduce its footprint in developed economies". HSBC plans to sell assets in Turkey and Brazil, where it will continue to service large corporate clients. 'World has changed' The news came ahead of a presentation that Mr Gulliver gave to investors and analysts in his second major strategy plan since taking up the role in 2011. "We recognise that the world has changed and we need to change with it. That is why we are outlining the following... strategic actions that will further transform our organisation," he said in a statement. The 10-point plan aims to cut costs by up to $5bn (£3.25bn) and increase investment in Asia - particularly in China. "Asia [is] expected to show high growth and become the centre of global trade over the next decade," Mr Gulliver said. "Our actions will allow us to capture expected future growth opportunities." Shares in HSBC were down 0.9% at 614p in afternoon trading in London, and closed down 0.5% in Hong Kong. The company is valued at almost £120bn. Headquarters decision James Antos, analyst at Mizuho Securities Asia, said the plan would not restore investor confidence in HSBC. "Slaughtering the staff is not necessarily the solution unless management makes the bank considerably less complex," he said. HSBC said it would make a decision on whether to move its headquarters out of the UK by the end of the year. There has been speculation that the British bank may relocate its headquarters to Hong Kong since it announced the review in April. Analysis: Robert Plummer, business reporter HSBC used to style itself as "the world's local bank", combining the heft of a global brand with the sophistication of local knowledge. Yet it started moving away from that business model as far back as 2011, hit by a combination of spiralling costs and setbacks in some of those local markets to which it was a latecomer. In fact, however much we hear about economic globalisation, global banks are having a tough time of it these days. Not only are they hard to manage, but they also face stiff competition from local banks in individual countries. In Brazil, for instance, where HSBC was unknown until 1997, it has been outflanked by local operators Itau and Bradesco. Unsurprisingly, then, it has decided to dispose of its subsidiary there and concentrate on the area where its expertise has always been clear: East Asia in general, and China in particular. Mr Gulliver laid out a number of criteria for the decision - including whether the UK government supported the growth of financial services industry. He insisted that any move would not be a response to any UK legislation affecting banks, but about deciding "where the mind of the company should be". The government bank levy cost HSBC more than £700m last year - more than any other bank. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to signal a review of the levy in his Mansion House speech on Wednesday night.
By Laura BickerBBC News, Seoul It can't be easy. Deciding to defect from North Korea can put your life and those you love in danger. For Pyongyang's diplomats, who have enjoyed a life of prestige and power, the danger in defecting is that much more real. These men and women are the Juche ideology foreign front line. Their main role is to raise capital for the regime, but although they are the elite in their home country, they are unlikely to receive such a privileged position anywhere else. Ambassadors and their staff are told to promote Pyongyang's point of view around the world, and will often seek out pro-North Korean groups in their respective countries. They also monitor local news, screening TV networks and newspapers for any mention of the Kim family. The latest development comes from Italy, where the government has expressed concern about the fate of the school-age daughter of Jo Song-gil, the North Korean ambassador to Italy who fled his home in Rome last year. Another high-profile diplomatic defector, Thae Yong-ho, had told reporters he understood she was forcefully repatriated back to Pyongyang. The ultimate traitors It's almost impossible to verify such claims but it does set out just how high the stakes are, particularly for defectors who come from an elite so privileged they are trusted enough to represent the country abroad. The higher your prestige, the higher the risk in leaving. Such a move is unlikely to be forgiven by the Kim regime - some elite defectors say they discovered that their families back in North Korea were punished, sent to prison or, in some cases, they believe members of their families were shot. They are global ambassadors for the Kim family, the figures who hold up the interests of the dynasty, in the face of an often hostile world. So it stands to reason - by Pyongyang logic - that dissent while working as a diplomat cannot be tolerated or even be seen to be tolerated. North Korea views diplomatic defectors as the ultimate traitors - because the humiliation is that much starker for the Kims. And yet it happens. Han Jin Myung was a second secretary in Vietnam and told NK News that he defected after failing to share with ministry officials the money he made from selling some items. He said diplomats were not paid well, and he received around $400 (£348) a month. His seniors reported him to Pyongyang and he felt he was in danger. He said he was certain he would be severely punished and quickly made the decision to leave. 'South Korea must embrace North Koreans' Diplomats who spend time abroad have been allowed to see how other countries live and work. They have gained a taste of another life; their children may have spent time at international schools. This glimpse of freedom may give them a taste for more. Despite the latest claims about the fate of his daughter, information is still scarce about the 48-year-old Jo Song-gil and his family. They were last seen in late November and are thought to be seeking asylum in a third country - some believe he's on his way to the United States. The details of this case remain murky and we may yet find out more about what has really happened. But these high-profile defectors also raise something of a dilemma for South Korea, particularly at a time it is forging a cautious camaraderie with the North. Here in South Korea, such defectors have historically been given protection and for good reason. Yi Han-yong, a nephew of Kim Jong-un's half-brother, was shot dead outside his home in a suburb of Seoul in 1997 after publishing a book about the Kim regime. His attackers were never caught. The former deputy ambassador to London, Thae Yong-ho, who defected in 2016, told reporters that he felt the South Korean government should be more proactive - but he no longer believed Mr Jo should seek shelter in the South. "South Korea needs to show that it is willing to embrace North Koreans," he said in a press conference. "But the current situation doesn't seem to do that. Neither the South Korean government nor its citizens express their intention to rescue Jo and his family after their defection, and I'm saddened by the current situation." "We need to tell North Korean citizens that the Republic of Korea is their motherland. And Korea would welcome any North Korean citizens who would want to come to this country." But the warmth of the welcome in the South is not guaranteed. Conservative governments have often used defectors to tarnish the North's image and highlight its human rights abuses. But in contrast, the liberal President Moon Jae-in is pursuing a policy of engaging with the North and his administration may be wondering what line to take. The South has long held the ideal that all Koreans are entitled to political and economic freedom. But the North often accuses Seoul of orchestrating these defections to undermine and embarrass them. This is not the kind of argument Mr Moon's government wants to have right now. Pyongyang's Foreign Ministry does not hide its outrage and disgust at those who speak out, such as Thae Yong-ho. Although not specifically naming him, they described him as "human scum" and were critical of the South Korean government for allowing him to speak at the National Assembly. We asked Seoul's Ministry of Unification and the Foreign Ministry about concerns that North Koreans were not being embraced. The Ministry of Unification spokesperson was very careful about the wording of the statement and said its position was that it "will accept all North Korean defectors who wish to come to the South of their own free will". Seoul does provide material assistance to North Korean refugees. There are now nearly 32,000 who have made the perilous journey to South Korea. They are aided in their new lives, offered a place to live and and education. But the Ministry of Unification seems to be concerned about how defectors' actions are perceived in the North. Last year, just days after the first meeting between President Moon and Kim Jong-un, one politically active defector was preparing to launch balloons into the North with brochures and flash drives. He has done this for 15 years. But he said he received a call asking him not to. When the group decided to go ahead with the balloon launch, they were surrounded by police. Kim Myong Song, a North Korean defector who is a journalist for one of South Korea's biggest daily newspapers, the Chosun Ilbo, was barred from covering an event at the truce village of Panmunjom. It has been his job since 2013 to cover North-South affairs, but the Unification Ministry said it had to take "necessary steps" because of the "special circumstance" of this meeting. "It hurts me," he told the BBC. "Defectors are South Korean citizens. We left an oppressive dictatorship and came to South Korea, placing all our trust on the democratic South Korean government. However, this government decided to exclude a defector journalist even when the North Korean government did not make a request. "It makes me feel vulnerable and fear that South Korean government may disown us if it is necessary and they will not come to protect us." Potential mine of information And yet there are benefits to welcoming North Korean defectors, particularly those that come with links to the rulers of the country. Kim Jeong-bong, the former chief director of Seoul's Institute for National Security and Strategy, told us that right now, Jo Song-gil would be a mine of information. "We can learn from Jo about the explanation North Korea has given for its recent diplomatic strategy and what kind of orders it has given to elite diplomats in regards to the last three South-North summits, and the US-North summit," he said. "It is possible that Kim Jong-un told his diplomats that he is trying to work with South Korea to gain economic support, or he may have said that he will never give up nuclear weapons even if he is are engaging with US. "Especially with Jo. His father and father-in-law were both high level diplomats. His father-in-law was a foreign ministry ceremonial secretary, which means he was sitting next to Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il when they were meeting international leaders. It is possible if Jo comes to South Korea, we can fit the pieces of the puzzle together and fill in the gaps of 70 years of North Korean diplomatic history." Mr Kim believes Mr Jo has gone to the United States and we are unlikely to hear more about his case for some time while Washington and Seoul are in talks with Pyongyang. "It is very possible that US won't make any statement about it. When Chang Sung Gil, the Egypt ambassador, and his brother Chang Sung Ho, at the North Korean trade mission in France, went to the US, it kept its silence. "It is highly likely Jo's case becomes like that." With a second summit between the North and the US just days away, many will consider that a prudent approach.
Mr Hagel, who arrived in the port of Qingdao from Japan, is thought to be the first senior Western official to board the vessel. China bought it from Ukraine in 1998 and has spent 10 years refitting it. It is seen as a potent symbol of China's ambition to modernise its navy, amid a strategic shift in the region. The fact that the US secretary of defence was allowed to step on board the carrier will be seen as a sign that the two countries may be willing to engage in more military co-operation, reports the BBC's Martin Patience in Beijing. Washington has repeatedly called for more transparency from Beijing on its military spending, our correspondent adds. Sea trials US officials said that the defence chief's visit to the Liaoning at Yuchi naval base - which took place after a US request - lasted about two hours. No further details were immediately available and journalists accompanying him on the China visit did not go with him. The carrier was built in the 1980s for the Soviet navy but was never completed. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the rusting hull - then called the Varyag - sat in dockyards in Ukraine. A Chinese company with links to China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) then bought the Varyag, saying it wanted to turn the vessel into a floating casino in Macau. In 2001 the ship was towed to China. The Chinese military confirmed in June 2011 that it was being refitted to serve as the nation's first aircraft carrier. Earlier this year, it completed sea trials in the South China Sea, where China has overlapping territorial claims with several South East Asian nations. Beijing's more assertive stance on this issue in recent years has led to a rise in tensions between China and its neighbours, particularly Vietnam and the Philippines. China is also embroiled in a separate dispute over East China Sea islands that are controlled by Japan. In Tokyo, Mr Hagel addressed regional territorial disputes, saying Chinese authorities should have "respect for their neighbours". "You cannot... redefine boundaries and violate territorial integrity and sovereignty of nations by force, coercion and intimidation, whether it's in small islands in the Pacific or large nations in Europe," he said. The Liaoning aircraft carrier has already attracted controversy. Late last year, Mr Hagel criticised China as "irresponsible" after the near-collision of a US warship and a Chinese naval vessel in the South China Sea. The US said its guided missile cruiser, USS Cowpens, was operating in international waters on 5 December when the Chinese vessel - which was accompanying the Liaoning - forced it to take evasive action. State-run newspaper Global Times, however, quoted an expert as saying that the US boat had been "harassing" the Liaoning as it carried out drills.
The Harry Potter writer revealed in February that she was working on the book, and said it would be "very different" from her previous material. The book will be published worldwide in hardback, e-book and as an audio download and CD on 27 September. "The freedom to explore new territory is a gift that Harry's success has brought me," Rowling said. The story is centred on the death of Barry Fairbrother, whose unexpected passing shocks the local villagers of Pagford. Publishers Little, Brown & Co said: "Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty facade is a town at war." The company describes the tale as being "blackly comic, thought-provoking and constantly surprising". Speaking at the premiere of the final Potter movie last year, Rowling told BBC News that the movie marked the start of a new writing direction. "I think I always felt that I didn't want to publish again until the last film was out, because Potter has been such a huge thing of my life. "I've been writing hard ever since I finished writing [Harry Potter and the Deathly] Hallows, so I've got a lot of stuff. And I suppose it's a question of deciding which one comes out first." More than 450 million copies of Rowling's seven Potter books have been sold worldwide. The novels, about a boy wizard who survives the attack that kills his parents, became a worldwide phenomenon and were turned into eight blockbuster films starring Daniel Radcliffe. When the final instalment of the book series went on sale in 2007, thousands of copies sold in minutes.
By Richard AndersonBusiness reporter, BBC News And as the chart below shows, in recent years it has begun loosening the purse strings - in 2005, the Chinese government and Chinese companies collectively invested about $17bn (£11bn) in global assets, according to The Heritage Foundation. Last year they invested almost $130bn. That sounds like a lot of money, but in the context of global world trade or the economic output of developed economies, it is small change. For example, the total amount of money invested by China into Britain over the past nine years amounts to just 0.7% of the UK's total GDP in 2012. And Britain is one of the more popular destinations for Chinese investment. It is in the top 10 nations globally and attracts more than double the investment of any other nation in Europe. Globally, Australia comes out top, but even here Chinese investment last year equated to just 0.6% of the country's annual GDP. In developing nations, Chinese investment is more significant. In Nigeria, for example, inflows from China equated to 2% of GDP in 2012. Almost half of all the money invested overseas by China and Chinese companies in the past nine years went into the energy and power sector. China's demand for energy is expected to triple by 2030 so countries with abundant natural resources will continue to attract the most money from China. While more Chinese money is invested in the energy sector than in any other in Britain, China holds a number of investments elsewhere, including in Barclays Bank, BP, Diageo and Thames Water. Most are minority stakes, but it does have a controlling interest in some household names. For example, Bright Foods owns a 60% stake in Weetabix, the Wanda conglomerate owns 92% of Sunseeker boats, while Geely Automobile owns Manganese Bronze, the company that makes London taxis. Some of the companies listed below are not British firms, but the investments shown refer to assets based in Britain. For example, last year China Investment Corporation paid Ferrovial $700m to buy a 10% stake in Heathrow airport, and paid $400m to Deutsche Bank to take a stake in the bank's London offices. There are four other UK companies that have received monies from China, but are not included in the list as the money went into divisions based overseas. The China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOCC) invested almost $1.5bn to take a 33% stake in Tullow Oil's Ugandan operations in 2011. In 2010, CNOCC spent $270m on a 5% stake in BG's energy interests in Australia. In 2008 and 2009, Aluminium Corporation of China (Chinalco) made two investments totalling $14.3bn in Rio Tinto to take a 12% stake in the mining giant's aluminium operations in Australia, and two years later paid another $1.4bn to Rio for a share of its steel business in Guinea. Finally, in 2008, oil trader Sinochem paid $470m for a stake in oil and gas exploration company Soco International for a stake in its oil business in Yemen.

By Michelle RobertsBBC News The biggest global study into attitudes on immunisation suggests confidence is low in some regions. The Wellcome Trust analysis includes responses from more than 140,000 people in over 140 countries. The World Health Organization lists vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 threats to global health. You need a modern browser (with JavaScript support) to view this interactive. Do people in your country trust vaccines? Search for a country: Search for a country: People were asked how much they agree with the statement. Select a statement to see results Totals may not sum to 100% due to rounding Wellcome analysed responses to five key survey questions and calculated a "trust in scientists" index of high, medium or low trust. Source: Wellcome Global Monitor, Gallup World Poll 2018 Sorry, there is no data for this location No internet connection. Please try again. If you can't see the interactive tool click or tap here. The global survey reveals the number of people who say they have little confidence or trust in vaccination. When asked if vaccines were safe: When asked if they believed vaccines worked: Why does it matter? There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against deadly and debilitating infections, such as measles. Vaccines protect billions of people around the world. They have completely got rid of one disease - smallpox - and are bringing the world close to eliminating others, such as polio. But some other diseases, such as measles, are making a resurgence and experts say people avoiding vaccines, fuelled by fear and misinformation, is one of the main causes. Dr Ann Lindstrand, an expert in immunisation at the WHO, said the current situation was extremely serious. "Vaccine hesitancy has the potential, at least in some places, to really hinder the very real progress the world has made in controlling vaccine-preventable diseases," she said. "Any resurgence we see in these diseases are an unacceptable step backwards." What about measles? Countries that were close to eliminating measles have been seeing large outbreaks. Data shows a rise in cases in almost every region of the world, with 30% more cases in 2017 than 2016. A decision not to vaccinate, for whatever reason, poses a risk to others as well as the individual from being infected themselves. If enough people are vaccinated, it stops the disease from spreading through a population - something experts call "herd immunity". Imran Khan, from the Wellcome Trust, said: "We are really concerned at the moment because for measles, anything less than 95% coverage can lead to outbreaks and that is what we are seeing." Where was trust low? Some people living in several higher-income regions were among the least certain about vaccine safety. In France - a country among several European ones now experiencing outbreaks of measles - one in three disagreed that vaccines were safe, according to the survey. That was the highest percentage for any country worldwide. People in France were also among the most likely to disagree that vaccines were effective, at 19%, and to disagree that vaccines were important for children to have, at 10%. The French government has now added eight more compulsory vaccinations to the three children in the country already receive. Neighbouring Italy - where 76% agreed vaccines were safe - recently passed a law that allows schools to ban unvaccinated children, or fine their parents, after immunisation rates dwindled. The UK has yet to go this far but Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he "won't rule out" the idea of introducing compulsory vaccinations if necessary. The US has also been experiencing its own measles outbreak - the biggest to hit the country in decades, with more than 980 confirmed cases in 26 states in 2019 to date. In Northern America, and Southern and Northern Europe, just over 70% of people agreed that vaccines were safe. The figure was as low as 59% in Western Europe, and 50% in Eastern Europe. In Ukraine, which reported the highest number of measles cases in Europe last year (53,218 in total) - only 50% of people agreed vaccines were effective. This figure was 46% in Belarus, 49% in Moldova, and 62% in Russia. Where was trust high? Most people in lower-income areas agreed vaccines were safe. The highest number was in South Asia, where 95% of people agreed, followed by Eastern Africa, where the figure was 92%. Bangladesh and Rwanda had nearly universal agreement about the safety and effectiveness and have achieved very high immunisation rates despite many challenges in physically getting vaccines to people. Rwanda became the world's first low-income country to provide young women universal access to the HPV vaccine that protects against cervical cancer. Mr Khan said: "It shows what can be achieved with concerted effort to improve vaccine uptake." What makes people sceptical? In the survey, people with more trust in scientists, doctors and nurses tended to be more likely to agree that vaccines were safe. Conversely, those who had sought information about science, medicine or health recently appeared to be less likely to agree. The Wellcome report does not explore all of the reasons behind low confidence but researchers say there are likely to be many factors involved. Some of it may be complacency - if a disease has become less common, then the need to get immunised may feel less pressing when weighing the benefits against any possible risk. All medicines, vaccines included, can have side-effects. But vaccines are thoroughly tested to check they are safe and effective. The internet means beliefs and concerns about vaccines can be shared in an instant, spreading information that isn't necessarily based on fact. In Japan, concerns about the HPV vaccine and a reported link with neurological problems were widely publicised, which experts think knocked confidence in immunisation in general. Similarly, in France, there was controversy about a pandemic influenza vaccine - accusations that the government bought high quantities of the vaccine and unsubstantiated claims that it had been made too quickly and couldn't be safe. In the UK, there has been misinformation circulating about the MMR jab and autism. Dr Lindstrand said: "One of the most important interventions to counteract doubts and worries about vaccines is to have health workers really well trained and able and ready to recommend vaccinations based on scientific truth and to be able to respond correctly to questions and concerns that parents have and communities have."

The ruling allows Mitsutoki Shigeta, 28, to pursue custody of the children. The son of a wealthy entrepreneur, he caused controversy in 2014 when he was revealed to have fathered at least 16 babies via surrogates in Thailand. His so-called "baby factory" case and others led to Thailand banning commercial surrogacy for foreigners. Mr Shigeta, who was not present at the trial, was awarded "sole parent" rights after the Thai surrogates forfeited their rights, according to the court, which did not name him. "For the happiness and opportunities which the 13 children will receive from their biological father, who does not have a history of bad behaviour, the court rules that all 13 born from surrogacy to be legal children of the plaintiff," Bangkok's Central Juvenile Court said in a statement. Mr Shigeta was awarded custody of his three other children in 2015. In 2014, he was investigated by Interpol for human trafficking after it emerged he had fathered 16 surrogate children in Thailand. His Bangkok apartment was raided and police found nine surrogate babies, nannies and a pregnant surrogate mother there. He left Thailand soon after, but later sued the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security for custody of the children. You may also like: 'He wanted a very large family' By Jonathan Head, BBC News, South East Asia correspondent When a blurred airport security photo was published, more than three years ago, of Mitsutoki Shigeta, holding an infant as he left Thailand, there was fevered speculation over his motives for siring so many children with surrogate mothers. Some of the children had already been taken to Cambodia, and the Thai police began investigating him for possible human trafficking. But his lawyer insisted he simply wanted a very large family, and that as the son of a wealthy Japanese entrepreneur he was able to look after them properly. A court in Bangkok has now accepted that explanation: Thai officials told the court they had travelled to Cambodia and Japan, and found he had enough carers and facilities to bring up the 13 children who are still in state care in Thailand. What is known about the father? Few details are known about the background of Mr Shigeta. According to Japanese media, he is the son of an IT billionaire and paid between $9,300 (£6,600) and $12,500 to each of the surrogate mothers. Thai media says Mr Shigeta is unmarried, owns several companies himself and has already made plans for the future of his children, including setting up trust funds for them. After leaving Thailand four years ago, he was thought to have moved to Hong Kong and currently lives in Japan again. Media reports also suggest he might have travelled to India and Ukraine to father children there. Gradual transfer of custody The 13 children will not immediately be transferred into Mr Shigeta's custody. His lawyer told AFP news agency that he would contact the Social Welfare Ministry about next steps, adding that the timelines still had to be agreed to avoid "abrupt changes" for the children. Mr Shigeta's case shed light on Thailand's booming surrogacy industry, as did the case of "Baby Gammy" which also emerged in 2014. Baby Gammy's Thai surrogate mother alleged that he was abandoned by his Australian parents after they found out he had Down's Syndrome. They took his twin sister home. An Australian court later cleared the family of abandonment.
This step will allow the "waking up process" to start, Sabine Kehm said in a statement. But bringing the seven-times champion out of the coma "could take a long time", she added. Schumacher suffered a severe head injury in a skiing accident in the French Alps on 29 December. He was put into a medically induced coma by his doctors at a clinic in Grenoble following operations to remove blood clots from his brain. Doctors have kept the 45-year-old German asleep to help reduce the swelling. Ms Kehm was approached by the media for comment on Schumacher's condition on Wednesday - exactly a month after his crash. She said then that his condition remained "stable". In her statement on Thursday, she said it had been agreed to communicate details of his sedation "only once this process was consolidated". The statement again included an appeal by Schumacher's family for privacy for them and for his doctors, while at the same time expressing "sincere appreciation for the worldwide sympathy". At his bedside since the accident, the family have received hundreds of letters and gifts from around the world. Earlier this month, investigators probing the accident said Schumacher had been going at the speed of "a very good skier" at the time of his crash in the resort of Meribel. He had been skiing 8m off-piste when he fell and hit a rock, investigators said. Experts reconstructed events leading up to the crash after examining Schumacher's skiing equipment and viewing footage filmed on a camera attached to his helmet. Schumacher retired from racing in 2012 after a 19-year career. He won two titles with Benetton, in 1994 and 1995, before switching to Ferrari in 1996 and going on to win five straight titles from 2000.
The images of the Russian Tu-95 Bear H planes were taken high in the sky north of Shetland by RAF Leuchars-stationed Flt Lt Gary Montgomery. The Tu-95s were detected close to UK airspace on Wednesday. Two Typhoons with 6 Sqd at Leuchars were scrambled to investigate. The air station in Fife has a quick reaction alert (QRA) role which involves intercepting suspicious aircraft. The RAF described the appearance of the Russian Bears as "routine". Similar incidents have occurred in the past. In March 2010, two Tu-160 Blackjacks were shadowed by two F3 Tornados from Leuchars after they appeared off the Western Isles. And in 2007, Tornado jets intercepted two Tu-95s spotted observing a Royal Navy exercise off the islands. Three years ago, elements of Russia's Baltic Fleet gathered 30 miles (48km) off the Moray Firth to shelter from bad weather. Speaking about Wednesday's encounter, Flt Lt Montgomery said: "We monitored their progress, including handing them over to Danish F-16 QRA aircraft as the Bears flew towards Denmark, then continued to monitor them as they returned and then departed towards Norwegian airspace." The RAF Typhoon pilot added: "Intercepting Russian Bear aircraft is a routine occurrence for us, it's what we do to maintain UK sovereign airspace." The MoD said similar incidents happened eight times during 2013. A spokesman said: "Russian military flights have never entered UK sovereign airspace without authorisation."
By Sarah Collerton and John HarrisonBBC News But behind the frontline of the pandemic there have been a huge number of people who have been busy doing essential jobs, as outlined by the government. They include those working across the food and transport industries, people providing childcare, working in public service and the financial sector. They have been allowed to travel to work and send their children to school while the rest of us have been in lockdown. We spoke to some of them to find out how lockdown has been. The falconer Matt Forward's job is to keep the pigeons away from Trafalgar Square. Pest management was covered in the key worker list, so throughout lockdown Matt drove himself and his Harris hawk 45 miles to the iconic square early two mornings a week. From 06:00, his "little boy" Lighten would fly around for a couple of hours - perching on Nelson's Column and the roof of the National Gallery. His presence alone was enough to keep the pigeons away. "If I was a pigeon and saw this beast flying around everywhere I wouldn't want to nest and get too comfy," he says. Matt, who lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said he never thought of stopping his job because of lockdown. "If someone wasn't there doing the job that we do, we'd be overrun," he says. Matt is new to the profession - he swapped his work as a plumber for the "best job in the world" a few months before lockdown. He saw a "hell of a difference" during lockdown, particularly because there were fewer people about, meaning there was less food waste for the pigeons to eat. "People aren't dropping bags of crisps in Trafalgar Square anymore," he says, "basically food isn't on a plate for them." But because there is less food around, it's changed the behaviour of the pigeons. They seem a bit braver because they're hungrier, he says. After he finishes in Trafalgar Square, he takes his bird of prey to other places in the capital - London Stadium, museums, hotels. Matt says he loves that, despite coronavirus, people still come up to him to ask him about what he's doing. "It's not as if I'm walking a dog down the road," he says. "People show a lot of interest in it - that's one of the reasons I love it." The asparagus farmers Lockdown has been "a rollercoaster" on Lunan Bay Farm, in Angus. Perched on the eastern coast of Scotland, the farm produces free range goat meat, honeyberries and other niche products. But a third of its business comes from asparagus - which has just a six-week season, running from early May until the middle of June. "Covid hit us right before our asparagus started," says Jillian McEwan, who runs the farm with her husband Neil, a fifth-generation farmer. "It is a high-intense time because it is such a short season." As food producers, they also qualified as key workers, but were faced with a race to pick - and then sell - their asparagus right in the middle of lockdown. "We were able to booster our workforce with people who had been furloughed or had been made redundant," Jillian says. They ended up with a team of 10-15 pickers, who all had to be equipped with masks, gloves and aprons. The farm usually uses lightweight tractors in the asparagus fields, with pickers filling baskets on a platform pulled behind it. But to ensure social distancing they needed a much larger platform, meaning a heavier tractor was required. Jillian worries about the impact the heavier machinery could have in the coming years. "By compacting the ground it will have an impact on next year's crop. So there were a lot of consequences of Covid for us." The farm has 15 acres of asparagus and harvested 7,500kg in the six weeks from 4 May. But then came the challenge of finding new customers to sell it to while it was fresh. The 70-plus restaurants who usually take most of it were all closed. Instead they've turned to small farm shops and independent retailers. Much of their asparagus has been delivered to people as part of veg boxes. "It actually proved to be quite successful for us. We could have actually sold three times the amount of asparagus we produced." The lock keeper "I have 62 volunteers that help me run manage the locks," says Alex Goode, site manager at Foxton Locks, in Leicestershire. "I went down to zero at the start of lockdown." As a key worker, the operation of the area became Alex's responsibility during lockdown. Located on the Leicester section of the Grand Union Canal, Foxton boasts the longest and steepest set of staircase locks in the UK. It is a set of 10 individual locks, split into two by a passing area. In the height of summer it can see 30-45 boats pass through every day. With all but essential travel stopped on the canal system at the beginning of lockdown, that number fell to between one and four a day. Yet boaters still needed to pass through the locks. "People who are living on their boats, it is their house, they still needed to get to areas where they could empty their toilets and fill up their water. Other people needed to move around to get to sick relatives, or to get somewhere to moor for lockdown." Working mainly from home, he created a next day booking system, where all the boats wanting to pass had to register for a set time the following day, giving Alex time to arrive, unlock the locks, and make sure coronavirus protocols were being stuck to by boaters. Alex would also perform a daily safety check to make sure there was no damage or vandalism to the lock - or to the tow path, where locals came for their daily permitted exercise. He says about 10-15 boats a day now pass through Foxton and he is looking forward to the canal volunteers returning at the beginning of July. The speech therapist "It resembled something out of ET," says Caitlin Rehal. The 37-year-old specialist speech and language therapist is describing the personal protective equipment she had to wear to see a 102-year-old patient. Neither were suspected of having coronavirus, but such PPE is just one of the changes Caitlin has seen in her profession since the pandemic hit. "It was almost impossible to engage with this patient while wearing all of this gear," she said. "It was very hard to get her to know I was a person trying to speak to her. My impression was it was as if a bin was speaking to her… like something was talking but perhaps it shouldn't be." Caitlin says that as the PPE guidance has changed she hasn't been required to wear the "ET" outfit again - now a surgical mask, gloves and an apron are deemed suitable to see patients. As a specialist health key worker, she has continued to work at Tunbridge Wells Hospital, in Kent, during the pandemic, treating people struggling to communicate or swallow, which affects their eating and drinking. She says her team regularly sees patients who have had a brain injury, a fall, or those with dementia, Parkinson's or multiple sclerosis. And now Covid-19 - because it affects the respiratory system, it can have an impact on the way people swallow, she says. "Overall we have had fewer patients but of those patients some of them are much higher risk. So it's been a bit of an adjustment," she says. It's also meant many of the patients her team treats have been younger than usual - aged in their 50s and 60s, rather than 70s and older. But because she has asthma, Caitlin has been unable to work with many of those higher risk patients. She can't see anyone suspected of having coronavirus, even with elaborate PPE. She says she's grateful for the support of her colleagues when she felt "she wasn't able to pull her weight". "Their understanding and appreciation of the work I was able to do, in lieu of being able to be on the high-risk wards with them, was very important for my emotional health in a very stressful period."

Merrill Newman, a Korean War veteran, was taken off a plane by uniformed officers at the end of a guided tour in North Korea last month, his son said. US officials have not specifically confirmed the case, but have called on North Korea to "resolve the issue". Another US citizen, Kenneth Bae, has been detained since last November. Mr Newman visited North Korea with a friend in October, his son, Jeffrey Newman said on Thursday. The guided tour was arranged with a travel agent "approved by the North Korean government for travel of foreigners", he added. Merrill Newman was taken off a plane on 26 October, the last day of his tour, as he was set to leave North Korea, Jeffrey Newman said. The veteran appeared to have discussed his experience in the Korean War with North Korean officials the day before his detention, his son added. Another veteran, also named Merrill Newman, was awarded a Silver Star medal for his efforts during the Korean War. In an interview with Reuters news agency, he said that he thought it was possible there had been "a case of mistaken identity". 'Arbitrary arrest' When asked about Mr Newman's detention, US Secretary of State John Kerry would not comment directly on the case, but said: "They have other people, too... These are all very, very disturbing choices by the North Koreans." US Special Representative for North Korea Policy Glyn Davies, said: "We are calling on North Korea, as in the Kenneth Bae case, to resolve this issue and let our citizens go free." He added that he could not comment specifically about Mr Newman's case "because we do not have a privacy act waiver". The US State Department revised its travel guidance for North Korea this week, saying: "US citizens crossing into North Korea, even accidentally, have been subject to arbitrary arrest and long-term detention." However, a small number of tourists do enter North Korea every year. Travel to North Korea is tightly controlled, with tourists only able to visit through tour companies that are accompanied by local guides. US troops backed South Korea in the 1950-1953 Korean War, which killed at least two million people.
He denies the allegation that he raped a Swedish woman in 2010. Swedish prosecutor Ingrid Isgren listened as an Ecuadorean prosecutor put the questions to Mr Assange. He took refuge in the embassy four years ago, fearing extradition. He says the sex was consensual and believes the allegations are politically motivated. The accusations relate to a visit Mr Assange made to Stockholm in August 2010 to give a lecture. Ms Isgren and Swedish police inspector Cecilia Redell left the embassy at 13:30 local time (13:30 GMT) without making any statement to the media. They may continue questioning Mr Assange for several days. Q&A: Julian Assange and the law Mr Assange has refused to travel to Sweden for questioning citing concerns he would be extradited to the US over Wikileaks' release of 500,000 secret military files on the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. However, lawyers argue that his extradition from Sweden would be even less likely than from the UK. Mr Assange is accused of raping a woman, named in legal papers as SW, at her home in August 2010. Swedish prosecutors dropped part of their investigation last year because of a statute of limitations. Mr Assange is "not hiding" at the embassy, but he will not go to Sweden because he would thereby risk losing his Ecuadorean asylum status, his lawyer Jennifer Robinson told the BBC on Monday. "Sweden refused to provide assurances against onward extradition to the United States," she said, accusing the Swedish authorities of "dragging their feet" over the case. Deadlock broken - by Caroline Hawley, BBC News It's taken many months of tortuous diplomatic and legal exchanges just to get the Swedish prosecutor in the door. Under the agreement worked out with Ecuador, the Swedes were not allowed to question Julian Assange directly. Instead questions were to be submitted in Spanish and put to the Wikileaks founder by an Ecuadorean prosecutor. No follow-up questions were allowed. This may explain why the Swedish prosecutor had been reluctant to question Julian Assange in London, insisting it would "lower the quality of the interview". She changed her mind in March 2015, a few months before lesser allegations made against Julian Assange had to be dropped because of a time limitation. At the embassy Mr Assange is beyond the reach of the UK authorities. Sweden has issued an arrest warrant for him, which he has appealed against. Shortly after Ms Isgren entered the embassy, a cat - said to belong to Mr Assange - appeared at one of the windows and began watching the journalists and Assange supporters gathered outside. The cat has its own Twitter feed, which says it lives with Mr Assange and is "interested in counter-purrveillance". Confidentiality A statement on behalf of the Swedish prosecutors, quoted by the Press Association, said the investigation would remain confidential. "Therefore, the prosecutors cannot provide information concerning details of the investigation after the interview," it said. One of Mr Assange's lawyers, Per Samuelson, said his client "is very happy that he finally will be given the opportunity to give his statement to the Swedish prosecution. "He has been waiting for this for over six years. He has prepared himself very carefully and will give a statement and will co-operate to the full extent."
Donald Tusk said there was "presently no consensus" within the EU about David Cameron's desire to restrict in-work payments for four years. Mr Tusk has written to EU leaders warning that uncertainty over the UK's future in the EU was "destabilising". The PM said he was encouraged the UK's reform agenda was being "taken on". But former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling warned that the UK's future in the EU was now "in the balance". Last month David Cameron set out his goal of a "new settlement" for the UK in the EU, made up of four key objectives: In his letter, Mr Tusk described the PM's plans as a "significant and far-reaching agenda". Of the four strands to the UK's demands, he said welfare reform was the most "delicate" and would require "substantive political debate" at this month's EU summit. Mr Cameron is attempting to reduce co-called "pull factors" for migrants in an attempt to reduce immigration figures. Mr Tusk wrote: "This is certainly an issue where we need to hear more from the British prime minister and an open debate among ourselves before proceeding further." On the demand to protect the interests of countries like the UK which are members of the EU but not of the euro currency, Mr Tusk said non-eurozone countries could have a mechanism to raise concerns, but appeared to rule out a "veto" right. 'Honest broker' On the question of the founding principle of "ever-closer union", he does not offer a view one way or the other on the UK's request to be exempted from that goal. Mr Tusk said the idea of "ever closer union" allowed countries to integrate at different levels and that there was a "largely-shared view" on the importance of national parliaments. The European Council president said good progress was being made in the talks, describing his role as that of an "honest broker" and saying all states had to show "readiness for compromise". He added: "Uncertainty about the future of the UK in the European Union is a destabilising factor. That is why we must find a way to answer the British concerns as quickly as possible." Mr Cameron said "of course" the whole renegotiation was difficult and said he hoped for a successful conclusion. His official spokeswoman said Mr Tusk's letter "marks another step forward in the renegotiations". UK's EU referendum in-depth Q&A: What Britain wants from Europe Guide to the UK's planned in-out EU referendum BBC News EU referendum special report The PM, who has not ruled out campaigning to leave if his demands are refused, has already said a deal will not be reached by Christmas. Mr Tusk recently said this month's EU summit should "pave the way" for a deal by February. 'Compromise' Robert Oxley, from the Vote Leave campaign, was dismissive of the PM's demands. "The one thing you could not describe these reforms as is ambitious," he told the BBC. But Lucy Thomas, of Britain Stronger In Europe, said it was a "really good agenda for reform" which "the rest of Europe wants to see as well". However, Mr Darling suggested that Mr Cameron's demands would have little impact on the final result of the referendum and those, like him, who wanted the UK to remain in the EU were not starting the campaign in "a great place". "What I do say is if we don't start making the argument soon in a way that impinges on the consciousness of the people of this country, the risk is you are leaving it awfully late." Meanwhile Syed Kamall, leader of the British Conservatives in the European Parliament, suggested there would have to be a compromise on the deal, saying "that's the way business is done in this town". "You are going to see a compromise of some form, but both sides will be pushing as hard as possible. I know the British Government will definitely be pushing for all four of their demands but let's see what the compromise is at the end of the day," he told BBC political correspondent Alex Forsyth.
The woman, Yujing Zhang, 32, told security she was at the Florida club to go to the pool, according to a criminal complaint filed in US District Court. "Due to a potential language barrier issue," staff believed she was related to a club member and let her in. Mr Trump was in Palm Beach at the time of the incident on Saturday 30 March. Ms Zhang - who was described in the affidavit as an "Asian female" - is charged with making false statements to a federal officer and illegally entering a restricted area. According to the court documents, upon entry to the club Ms Zhang changed her story, telling a front-desk receptionist she was there to attend a "United Nations Chinese American Association" event. The receptionist, who knew that such an event had been scheduled, became suspicious of Ms Zhang. The suspect was transported off the property for further questioning. She told agents she had been instructed by a friend, identified only as "Charles", to travel from Shanghai, China, to Palm Beach to attend the purported United Nations event, but did not provide any more details, according to court documents. She said "Charles" had encouraged her to attempt to speak to a member of the president's family about Chinese-American economic relations, said the affidavit. Secret service agent Samuel Ivanovich said Ms Zhang carried four mobile phones, a laptop, an external hard drive and a thumb drive containing a computer virus, but no swim suit. In the court document, Mr Ivanovich notes that Ms Zhang "freely and without difficulty conversed" in English, becoming "verbally aggressive" with authorities as the investigation progressed. The Secret Service said in a statement that it "does not determine who is invited or welcome at Mar-a-Lago; this is the responsibility of the host entity. "The Mar-a-Lago club management determines which members and guests are granted access to the property." Ms Zhang's lawyer has so far declined comment. She will remain in custody until a hearing next week. If convicted, she could face a maximum of five years in prison.
Security plans will be reviewed and any necessary lessons learned, the home secretary said in a Commons statement. Her comments come as the Metropolitan Police revealed there are 600 counter-terror investigations active in the UK. Armed police will be deployed at the football match between England and France at Wembley Stadium on Tuesday. Prince William, who is president of the Football Association, has decided to attend the friendly out of "solidarity to the people of France", the BBC's Peter Hunt said. Multiple attacks on bars, restaurants, a concert hall and the Stade de France on Friday left 129 people dead, including Briton Nick Alexander from Essex. The Islamic State group has said it was behind the killings. A minute's silence was observed across Europe at 11:00 GMT on Monday, including at Trafalgar Square and the French Embassy in London, as well as in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Among hundreds injured is Callum MacDonald, 24, from Fort William in Scotland, who was in the Bataclan concert hall where gunmen opened fire. He is understood to be in a medically-induced coma. Could it happen in the UK? UK reaction to Paris attacks: Live coverage Paris attacks: Latest updates 'It hurts the same as if I knew them' 'They will fail' Speaking in the Commons, Mrs May confirmed that new funding would be made available for an extra 1,900 security and intelligence officers at MI5, MI6 and GCHQ - an increase of 15%. She said those who had attacked Paris "represent no-one and they will fail" to divide free countries such as Britain and France. "France grieves but she does not grieve alone. People of all faiths, all nationalities and all backgrounds around the world are with you and together we will defeat them," she said. Analysis By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner The announcement on Monday that Britain's intelligence and security agencies are to be given a massive boost in resources has taken some there by surprise. Expecting a modest boost in the coming Strategic Defence and Security Review, they have now been told they are to get a 15% increase in headcount, raising their numbers by 1,900. For MI5, the Security Service and MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service, this will take some time to absorb, perhaps years. They will need to find, recruit, vet and train new intelligence officers largely from scratch. But for GCHQ, the government's secret listening station in Cheltenham, it will be relatively easier for them to recruit already-qualified IT analysts and linguists from the commercial marketplace. Deploying extra aviation security officers should also show results fairly quickly. They will be expected to assess security in overseas airports used by large numbers of Britons where security is suspected of being lax. Mrs May said police and emergency services had been prepared for the possibility of a "marauding gun attack" in the UK since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, but plans would be reviewed in light of Friday's events. "As soon as the attacks took place, we took steps to maintain the security of the UK," she said. "The police have increased their presence on some streets and at some locations, and they will be intensifying their approach at events in big cities." The UK's Border Force had intensified checks on people, goods and vehicles entering the UK - and was carrying out "targeted" security checks against passengers and vehicles travelling to France, the home secretary added. She also said she would be lobbying her European counterparts for tighter gun laws across the European Union. In other developments: Mrs May said that in recent months, "a number of serious plots" had been disrupted in the UK, adding there could be "little doubt" that the threat posed by IS militants was evolving. More than 750 people are thought to have travelled from the UK to Syria and Iraq, and approximately half of those have returned, she said. The terror threat level in the UK has been at "severe" - meaning an attack is highly likely - since last August. Earlier, Mr Cameron said world leaders had agreed to do more to share intelligence and cut off funding for terrorists, as the Paris attacks "underlined the threat we all face". Speaking at the G20 summit in Turkey, he said the gap between Russia and the West's position on Syria "has been enormous", but now "everyone recognises the need for compromise". Meanwhile in the UK, officers from the Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command unit are interviewing people returning from France who may have information. The Met is also appealing for any potential witnesses to contact its anti-terrorist hotline, on 0800 789 321. Main attack sites: Bataclan concert venue, 50 Boulevard Voltaire, 11th district - 89 dead when stormed by gunmen, three of whom were killed; another gunman died nearby La Belle Equipe, 92 rue de Charonne, 11th district - 19 dead in gun attacks Le Carillon bar and Le Petit Cambodge restaurant at rue Alibert, 10th district - 15 dead in gun attacks La Casa Nostra restaurant, 92 rue de la Fontaine au Roi, 11th district - five dead in gun attacks Stade de France, St Denis, just north of Paris - explosions heard outside venue, three attackers and a bystander killed
By Kelly-Leigh CooperBBC News Under the initiative, proposed by Environment Southland, cat owners in Omaui will have to neuter, microchip and register their moggies with local authorities. After their pet dies, cat lovers in the community will then not be allowed to get any more. It sounds extreme, but it may be something more communities should be considering: after all, cats are responsible for the death of billions of birds and mammals each year - and, according to some, it is all our fault. Dr Peter Marra, the head of the Smithsonian Migratory Bird Centre, has authored journals and books on the issue. Contrary to preconceptions about him, he insists he is not anti-cat or against cat ownership. "Cats make wonderful pets - they're spectacular pets! But they shouldn't be allowed to roam outside - it's a really obvious solution," he told the BBC. "We would never let dogs do that. It's about time we treat cats like dogs." In Omaui, officials say the measure is justified because cameras have shown roaming cats preying on birds, insects and reptiles in the area. "So your cat can live out its natural life at Omaui happily doing what it's doing. But then when it dies, you wouldn't be able to replace it," bio-security operations manager Ali Meade explained. Under the plan, anyone not complying would receive a notice, before officials would remove the pets - but only as an "absolute last resort". The initiative is part of the regional council's proposed regional pest management plan, which was opened for consultation on Tuesday. John Collins, chairman of the Omaui Landcare Charitable Trust, championed the ban to protect "high-value" nature reserves there. 'We're not cat haters, but we want our environment to be wildlife-rich," he said, the Otago Daily Times reports. How big a problem are cats? The debate about cat populations and local eco-systems is not unique to Omaui. Conservation scientists have long warned about the impact of feral and outdoor cats on the global eco system - and they've been ranked among the 100 worst non-native invasive species in the world. Dr Marra says 63 species extinctions around the world are now linked to the booming cat populations. The problem is exacerbated in areas with very sensitive eco-systems, like New Zealand. "It sounds extreme," he says. "But the situation has got out of control." He believes cat-lovers around the world need to embrace a "different mind-set" toward the animals. He believes they should be adopted where possible, then neutered and exercised at home using toys, or in a controlled environment - for example, on a leash. "This predicament is not the fault of cats - it's humans' fault," he insists. Because of their popularity on social media and in memes, the global pet population shows no sign of abating. "They are just cute - everything about them, which makes this whole thing more difficult." Accurate estimates are hard to ascertain, but in the US there are about 86 million pet cats - roughly one in every three households. Unquantifiable amounts live stray or feral, meaning huge casualties in the environment. It is estimated that as many as four billion birds and 22 billion mammals are killed by cats in the US every year. Even in the UK, populations are on the decline, and experts blame cats. The Mammal Society says that about 55 million birds are falling casualty each year. 'Natural-born killers' It's not the first time cats have been painted as a menace in New Zealand - a country boasting a feline in almost half its households. They're a hot issue in Australia too, where feral and outdoor cats are blamed for millions of native species' deaths every night. The nation has been funding grassroots culling initiatives since 2015, boasts the world's largest cat-proof fence and has even considered introducing a national curfew for domestic cats. Councils and state governments have been taking the cat problem into their own hands - forcing cats to stay indoors at night, implementing household quotas and mandatory identification and neutering. Nevertheless, initiatives against felines remain controversial. Last year animal rights groups laid particular scorn at one Queensland local council who were offering $10 bounties for feral cat scalps. In Omaui, residents told local media they were "shocked" and "hoodwinked" by the proposed ban and have vowed to resist it. Nico Jarvis, a local resident who says her three cats help combat rodents in her house, compared the proposal to a "police state". ''It's not even regulating people's ability to have a cat. It's saying you can't have a cat,'' she told the Otago Daily Times. Paw Justice, a New Zealand-based non-profit that focuses on animal abuse, posted about the plan on Facebook, questioning the evidence behind it. Cat-lovers on the group's Facebook page reacted angrily to the news and pointing out that poisons, cars and humans also damage native species. Local residents have until the end of October to register their submissions to Environment Southland's plan. You may also like:
By Paula McGrathHealth check, BBC World Service How to fix it When we think, move, speak, dream and even love - it all happens in the grey matter. But our brains are not simply one colour. White matter matters too. Much of the research into dementia has focused on the tell-tale plaques of beta amyloid and tau protein tangles which occur in the grey matter. But one British scientist, Dr Atticus Hainsworth says the white matter - and its blood supply - may be equally important. The white colour results from fatty sheaths around the axons - which are extensions of the nerve cell bodies and help the cells to communicate. He is using banks of donated brains, in Oxford and Sheffield, to analyse white matter for potential triggers such as leaking blood vessels. "Some of the cases had an MRI or CT scan and that information can help give more clues about whether there was disease in the white matter - and what its basis might be," says Dr Hainsworth. If leaking blood vessels in white matter do play a key role in the development of dementia then it may offer up a another potential route for new drug therapies. How to make us all geniuses For years caffeine was used to enhance alertness. But popping a pill to get straight-A's may soon become the norm. At Cambridge University neuroscientist Barbara Sahakian is investigating cognitive enhancers - drugs which make us smarter. She studies how they can improve the performance of surgeons or pilots and asks if they could even be used to make us more entrepreneurial. But she warns that there is no long-term safety information on these drugs and as a society we need to talk about their use. She says the scientific and ethical challenges created by drugs which affect the production of brain chemicals like dopamine and noradrenaline - which induce pleasurable or "fight or flight" responses - need to be debated in order to decide whether drug-tests become routine before taking an exam. Dr Sahakian adds: "I frequently talk to students about cognitive-enhancing drugs and a lot of students take them for studying and exams. "But other students feel angry about this, they feel those students are cheating." How can we harness our unconscious? People need to be on top of their game when mastering skills like playing a musical instrument or detecting a bomb. But research suggests that our unconscious can be harnessed to help us excel. Repeatedly playing a tricky piece of music obviously helps develop a familiarity with the bits that are most difficult. But cellist Tania Lisboa, who's also a researcher in the Centre for Performance Science at London's Royal College of Music, says it also helps to send the trickier parts of a piece from her conscious to the unconscious part of her brain. After hours of practice, a fluent musician's brain stores how to play the piece in an area at the back of the brain called the cerebellum - literally "the little brain". Neuroscientist Prof Anil Seth, of Sussex University, says: "It has more brain cells than the rest of the brain put together. "It helps to promote fluid movements.. So the conscious effort of learning how to bow a cello is moved from the cortical areas which are involved when it's new or difficult over to the cerebellum, which is very good at producing unconscious fluent behaviour on demand." Music and defence may not appear to have much in common, but the unconscious can also help detect potential threats, whether it's a suspicious person in a crowd or the presence of an improvised explosive device. The unconscious brain is really good at spotting patterns - a skill which Paul Sajda at Colombia University in New York exploits - right at the boundary of the conscious/sub-conscious. "I can flash 10 images a second and if one of those images has something out of the ordinary..that will essentially cause me to re-orient my brain to that image - but I'm not exactly aware of what that is." Brain activity is monitored whilst the analyst looks at images so that researchers can later see which images triggered reactions. What dreams are for It's just 60 years since scientists in Chicago first noted the tell-tale "rapid eye movement" or REM sleep which we now associate with dreaming. But our fascination with dreams dates back at least 5,000 years to ancient Mesopotamia when people believed that the soul moved out of a sleeping body to visit the places they dreamed of. REM sleep - which occurs every 90 minutes or so - begins with signals from the base of the brain which eventually reach the cerebral cortex - the outer layer of the brain which is responsible for learning and thought. These nerve impulses are also directed to the spinal cord, inducing temporary paralysis of the limbs. Prof Robert Stickgold, from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for Sleep and Cognition in Boston, believes that dreams are vital for processing memory associations. He has asked the subjects of some of his sleep studies to play Tetris - and then noted their descriptions of how they floated amongst geometric shapes in their dreams. He's an admirer of Japanese scanning research where the scientists could "read" the dreams of subjects as they had MRI scans. But he says it's hard to get people to sleep in a noisy, expensive scanner. And the future? "I would like to see research which reveals the rules for dream construction - and how it relates to the larger concept of memory processing during sleep." One even more elusive goal: how to dream just happy dreams and ditch the bad ones, especially nightmares. Can we cure unreachable pain? Excruciating chronic pain is one of medicine's most difficult problems to solve. Untouched by conventional treatments like painkilling drugs, surgeons are now testing their theory that deep brain stimulation could provide relief. It is a brain surgery technique which involves electrodes being inserted to reach targets deep inside the brain. The target areas are stimulated via the electrodes which are connected to a battery-powered pacemaker surgically placed under the patient's collar bone. One of the pioneers of this technique is Prof Tipu Aziz at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Deep brain stimulation has been used in the past for Parkinson's disease and depression, and is now being trialled on obsessive compulsive disorder patients as well as those in chronic pain. One of his patients, Clive, has suffered from terrible pain for nearly a decade after an operation to remove a disc in his neck. "Sometimes I thought that if I had an axe, I'd chop my own arm off, if I thought it would get rid of the pain." The doctors explained to him that his brain was getting signals from his arm to his brain confused and that the electrodes could help. In Clive's case this was an area of the brain called the anterior cingulate. A week after his surgery he was one of the fortunate 70% of patients for whom the deep brain stimulation provides relief. "It's great to be out of that pain now. Since having the implant I can sit down for longer, I am able to walk further, everything is an improvement." Prof Aziz is treating medical conditions. But he is aware of ethical dilemmas which could arise if the technique was applied to other areas. "Putting electrodes in targets to improve memory. "Or you could put electrodes into people to make them indifferent to danger and create the perfect soldier."
They told US media that the FBI and CIA were co-ordinating the inquiry after Wikileaks published thousands of files. These carried claims that the CIA had developed ways to listen in on smartphone and smart TV microphones. The CIA, FBI and White House have declined to comment on the authenticity of the files leaked on Tuesday. A CIA spokesperson told the BBC on Wednesday: "The American public should be deeply troubled by any Wikileaks disclosure designed to damage the intelligence community's ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries. "Such disclosures not only jeopardise US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm." CIA faces huge problem over malware claims CIA hack: Should we be worried? 'Incredibly damaging' On Wednesday, the US officials - who spoke on the condition of anonymity - told US media that the criminal investigation was looking into how the files came into Wikileaks' possession. The inquiry would also try to establish whether the disclosure was a breach from inside or outside the CIA, the officials added. The CIA has not confirmed whether the documents - said to date between 2013 to 2016 - are real. But one of its former chiefs was concerned by their publication. "If what I have read is true, then this seems to be an incredibly damaging leak in terms of the tactics, techniques, procedures and tools that were used by the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct legitimate foreign intelligence," ex-CIA director Michael Hayden told the BBC. "In other words, it's made my country and my country's friends less safe." 'Zero day' bugs Several of the tech firms whose products have been allegedly compromised by the CIA gave their first reactions on Wednesday. Apple said it had already addressed some of the vulnerabilities. "The technology built into today's iPhone represents the best data security available to consumers, and we're constantly working to keep it that way," it said. Samsung - whose F8000 series of televisions was reportedly compromised - said that "protecting consumers' privacy and the security of our devices is a top priority at Samsung". The leaks also claimed that the CIA had created malware to target PCs running Microsoft's Windows operating system. "We are aware of the report and are looking into it," a spokesman from Microsoft said. Google has also reacted to claims that the CIA was able to "penetrate, infest and control" Android phones due to its discovery and acquisition of "zero day" bugs - previously unknown flaws in the operating system's code. "As we've reviewed the documents, we're confident that security updates and protections in both Chrome and Android already shield users from many of these alleged vulnerabilities," the firm told the news site Recode. "Our analysis is ongoing and we will implement any further necessary protections. We've always made security a top priority and we continue to invest in our defences." The World Wide Web Foundation - which campaigns for internet privacy - said the US government needed to issue a detailed response. The reaction from China and Russia, by BBC Monitoring The Wikileaks claims are a prominent talking point in China's media, with many outlets warning Chinese citizens to take extra safety precautions. Influential regional daily Chengdu Commercial Daily tells readers to "update device software, don't leave TVs on standby, and don't read confidential documents on your phone". Nationalist newspaper Global Times says that the report "shows the need for cyber rules". Russian media have also given extensive coverage to the claims. Russia's English-language channel RT was quick to point to suggestions that the revelations "could be used to prove that allegations of Russian hacking are actually a secret US plot". Russia's main domestic TV channels do not question the claims and insist instead on their likely authenticity. Channel One TV says that the "CIA has created a cyber bomb", adding that "the scandal is only going to gain momentum".
They have spent months preparing up to 400 prosecution-ready files on the group's senior leaders and fighters. Internal IS documents acquired by the team show "command responsibility" for numerous atrocities. The group has taken over swathes of Iraq and Syria in recent months. Working in strict secrecy, the team of experts has spent all year actively investigating commanders, emirs and provincial governors for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The atrocities alleged to have been committed by those in their ranks include kidnappings, beheadings, crucifixions, torture and summary executions. On Wednesday, President Barack Obama vowed to destroy the group after it released a video showing the beheading of American journalist Steven Sotloff. The group has carried out several more beheadings, including that of another US journalist, James Foley, and Kurdish fighters. Mr Obama's comments came as campaign group Human Rights Watch said it had uncovered new sites of Islamic State mass killings in the Iraqi city of Tikrit. The militants are believed to have murdered more than 500 Iraqi soldiers after taking over a large Iraqi army base in June. Building a case against IS The highly experienced war crimes investigators, working out of a nondescript headquarters in a European city, have avoided all publicity until now. But in an interview with the BBC, they revealed that they were being funded by the UK Government to the tune of $70,000 (£43,000) a month and employ sources both in Syria and in the neighbouring countries. "We would like to see the murderers of James Foley brought to justice," the chief investigator told the BBC. "Having said that, those particular offenders and others like them are not the focus of our investigations." "What we are after are the highest-level members of IS because these individuals are just as responsible for the countless murders as those men who kill with their own hands," he added. "Indeed, those leaders are more responsible because they don't kill one person or two people. They are responsible for all the killings." The team has boxes of evidence smuggled out of Syria, consisting of documents, memory sticks and witness testimonies. They even have the actual minutes of an Islamic State provincial meeting that goes into such detail as forbidding their guards in Aleppo province to sleep in after 07:30. The investigators have managed to build up an intricate picture of how IS is run, with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-appointed caliph, at the top. Directly beneath him are four advisory councils: Sharia (Islamic Law), Shura, Military and Security, with the latter two being the most powerful. This one-plus-four structure is then duplicated down the chain of command, right down to local level. The investigators' command structure document is available as a download: The team say the number of foreign recruits to IS has surged since it declared itself a caliphate in the summer, with estimates of their total strength having been revised upwards from around 10,000 to near 30,000. There is a wide diversity in capability, the team says, with Tunisians and Chechens being among the most valued footsoldiers for their aggression and experience on the battlefield. British recruits With a few exceptions, investigators believe that British jihadists tend to cross the border from Turkey into Syria with no military experience and very little religious knowledge. After three months in a safe house getting basic military training and indoctrination, they are assigned tasks and roles. "By and large the Westerners are given menial or low-level tasking by the emirs [the commanders]," said another of the investigators, "because they tend to arrive with no discernable battlefield skills. "So its assumed they're better off providing support services to the group as they are unlikely to have either the religious or military expertise IS is looking for," he added. The investigators have put together a diagram showing links between al-Baghdadi and some named individuals. Despite their apparent role in the recent murders of the two American journalists, no British jihadists are thought to have reached any senior positions within Islamic State. Around half the estimated 500-600 who have travelled to Syria are now thought to be back in the UK. The team has reached the conclusion that IS is a far more structured and disciplined organisation than was previously thought. "Our breakthrough came maybe two or three months ago when we looked at all the evidence that we'd gathered to date," the chief investigator told the BBC. "We realised what we were looking at was not a militant organisation, we were witnessing the process of nation-building." "That includes the provision of services, looking after the population - there is a military element of course but IS is just what it says, it is not a one-off phenomenon. They are building an Islamic state in the desert." The investigators say they expect some of their most important case files to be complete by the end of this year. But the team admits that bringing any of the suspects to trial will be almost impossible at present because they are hard to find and well protected. There is also the problem of legal jurisdiction as the team's remit runs only to Syria, not Iraq, and they say there is, at present, no court yet ready to try them.
BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie has been asked to talk to staff about the shelved broadcast last December. The discussion will be fed back to the BBC Trust chairman, Lord Patten. The corporation has always said the decision to drop the film was taken for "editorial reasons". A statement from the BBC said: "This is not a review. The director general has simply asked Ken MacQuarrie to talk to members of the Newsnight team who had emailed him." Newsnight editor Peter Rippon has previously insisted it was his decision to drop the story following newspaper reports that he was ordered to drop the investigation. Writing in a BBC Editors blog, he said: "It has been suggested I was ordered to do it by my bosses as part of a BBC cover-up. It has also been suggested that we deliberately withheld information from the police. "Both these allegations are totally untrue and, despite consistent strong denials, keep getting repeated." He said some of his team "disagreed strongly" with the decision but that others "agreed equally strongly". "However, those who disagreed accepted my decision. There were no rows of any kind as has been reported," he said. The Metropolitan Police is now leading an inquiry into claims of abuse against the Leeds-born presenter and is pursuing 120 separate lines of inquiry. A further two forces have referred a total of three new complaints to Scotland Yard, it has emerged. Hospital assaults Fresh allegations about Savile are continuing to emerge. On Friday, a woman told the BBC that Savile abused a 12-year-old girl during a visit to a children's home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in the 1970s. She said the victim told her Savile indecently touched her after they went upstairs together. Meanwhile, several hospitals are investigating allegations that Savile preyed on children during visits to wards as part of a catalogue of abuse. Leeds General Infirmary has received two complaints of sexual assault by Savile dating back to the 1970s. It is also claimed he groped patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, Buckinghamshire, where he was a volunteer fundraiser. The Conservative Party chairman, Grant Shapps, said on BBC One's Question Time that there were questions to be answered and "the BBC knows that". He described the number of people who had come forward with claims of abuse as "disturbing". He also said he would be in favour of the Honours Forfeiture Committee looking at whether or not it could strip Savile of his knighthood, despite the Cabinet Office previously stating there were currently no legal arrangements in place to remove honours posthumously. Part of the reason is that an OBE or a knighthood expires when a person dies. Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint, who also appeared on the programme, said there should be a close look at the BBC "as an institution" and whether there was more it could have done. Meanwhile, the Sun claimed Savile assaulted a 17-year-old patient during a visit to Broadmoor as a hospital fundraiser in the 1970s. The claim is being investigated by its NHS trust. But West London Mental Health NHS Trust said it had not been approached by police or any former patients or their representatives with any allegations. The BBC will also hold an inquiry into allegations Savile abused girls while working for the corporation after the police investigation is completed. A figure from outside the corporation will run it.
"We once again urge the Philippines to withdraw... from the islands that it is illegally occupying," foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said on Monday. It comes after about 50 protesters, mostly students, landed on Pagasa in the Spratly archipelago on Saturday. They said they wanted to highlight growing Chinese encroachment. China claims almost all the South China Sea, believed to be rich in resources, dismissing rival claims by neighbours. Apart from the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam all lay claim to the disputed waters. The protesters, led by a former naval commander and called Kalayaan Atin Ito (Kalayaan This Is Ours), landed on Saturday and said they would stay for three days - they told the BBC that they would leave by 30 December. They have described the journey as a "patriotic" voyage and a symbolic act of defiance against China. The government did not sanction the journey and citied safety and security concerns. Tension has intensified over the last year, fuelled by China's aggressive island-building and naval patrols and the area has also seen the US and Australia undertaking freedom of navigation operations. A recent BBC investigation witnessed at close quarters China's construction of new islands on coral reefs in the area and was repeatedly warned off by Chinese authorities while on a civilian flight in the vicinity of the islands. The Philippines has a case challenging Beijing before the arbitration court in The Hague. It says the "nine-dash line", which China uses to demarcate its territorial claims, is unlawful under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, which both countries have signed. China has boycotted the proceedings, insisting that the panel has no authority to rule in the case.
The deployment - to help train local forces - will be in the "very low hundreds" but could also include a small protection force of combat-ready soldiers, he said. About 50 UK troops are already training Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State militants in Iraq. The Ministry of Defence said the move had not yet been formally approved. An MoD spokesman said: "No decisions on troop numbers, units or locations have yet been made". However, speaking to the Telegraph, Mr Fallon said the fresh troop deployment would be made in January and would be to four training centres that US forces are establishing. Roadside devices It comes after 12 UK trainers were deployed to Iraq in October to work with Kurdish forces in the northern city of Irbil. Mr Fallon also announced plans to boost the UK numbers further last month. RAF aircraft have been flying missions over Iraq and carrying out air strikes against IS targets since Parliament approved military action on 26 September. British aircraft had flown a "huge number" of missions "second only to the United States, five times as many as France", Mr Fallon told the newspaper. "Our role now, apart from the air strikes, is increasingly going to be on training," he said. "In particular, it will mean dealing with car and truck bombs and roadside devices, as well as basic infantry skills. "We have not finalised numbers yet - obviously we have got a lot of kit back from Afghanistan that we can make available - but we are talking very low hundreds." 'Rooted out' British troops would be able to pass on the "lessons we have learnt from Afghanistan", Mr Fallon added. He said IS fighters were increasingly now "tucked away in towns and villages" as a result of air strikes. "That means they have got to be rooted out by ground troops. This has to be done by an own-grown army, not by western groups." He stressed that the US training centres - one based in Kurdistan and three near the Iraqi capital Baghdad - were "not where the fighting is". "They are in safe areas but obviously there's always a small element of force protection." The soldiers "will not be expected to fight a war but will be there to defend the British personnel if necessary", he added. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said Labour supported the steps taken to assist Iraq's government in responding to IS. "It is right that the UK's armed forces continue to provide training and equipment in support of this effort," he added. "The government should provide clarity about the scale, scope and timeframe of the deployment of these further trainers. "The defence secretary should clearly outline the numbers of military trainers involved and the work that they will be doing, so that there can be no misunderstanding about the role of British troops in Iraq." US training Large swathes of Syria and Iraq are currently under the control of IS extremists. Pressure to provide more support to new Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi to reclaim territory in the north and west has been growing. The US has agreed to send around 500 soldiers to Iraq and elsewhere in the region, with the aim of retraining the Iraqi army. BBC political correspondent Alan Soady said the UK deployment of a combat-ready protection force could prompt opposition from some people. "Does it, will be the question, break David Cameron's pledge that there would be no British boots on the ground?" he said. British forces were pulled out of Iraq in 2011, eight years after the mission that brought down Saddam Hussein.
The 36 year old admitted killing 77 people when he bombed central Oslo and then went on a shooting spree at a youth camp on a nearby island in 2011. Breivik has been studying certain course modules since first applying to the University of Oslo in 2013, but he will now be taught as a full student. He will have no contact with staff or students as he studies from his cell. In 2012, he was sentenced to the maximum 21 years in prison for carrying out Norway's worst massacre since World War Two. This jail term can be extended if he is deemed to remain a danger to society. The university's rector, Ole Petter Ottersen, said that Norwegian inmates "have a right to pursue higher education in Norway if they meet the admission requirements and are successful in competition with other applicants." Writing on the university's website, Mr Ottersen admitted that the university had faced "moral dilemmas" about Breivik's admission. The rector added that the university had students whose family members had been killed by Breivik. However, he said that the university would abide by its rules "for our own sake, not for his." As he studies from his prison, Breivik will be subject to strict regulations. He will be allowed no access to internet resources or receive any personal guidance from tutors. All communication with the university will take place via "a contact person in prison". Breivik first applied to study in 2013 but did not meet entry requirements as he had never completed secondary school. Instead, he was allowed to study certain political science modules. His deadly rampage at a Labour Party youth camp on Utoeya island was found by an Oslo court to have been a premeditated act of terrorism. He harboured extremist right-wing views and claimed he had reacted against what he saw as a Marxist-Islamic takeover of Europe.
Mr Obama said Mr Kerry's "entire life" prepared him for the role, and praised him for the "respect and confidence" he has earned from world leaders. Mr Kerry ran as Democratic presidential candidate in 2004 and is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His nomination comes after the US ambassador to the UN, Susan Rice, withdrew from consideration last week. Republicans had fiercely criticised her role in the aftermath of the deadly attack on the US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in September. Influential senator Speaking at the White House, Mr Obama said Mr Kerry understood the need to "harness all elements of American power", and said the veteran senator was "not going to need a lot of on-the-job training". The president added that he was sure Mr Kerry would be swiftly confirmed in the Senate. Mrs Clinton, who is still recuperating from a stomach virus and concussion, was not present for the announcement. But in a statement, Mrs Clinton said Mr Kerry was an "excellent choice" of head for the state department. "He will be able to sustain and extend America's global leadership," she said. Mr Kerry, 69, becomes Mr Obama's first new cabinet nomination since he won a second term in November. The president will also have to name a new defence secretary to replace Leon Panetta, and a new director of the CIA to take over from David Petraeus, who quit last month after admitting an affair. Mr Kerry, a decorated Vietnam veteran, lost a close presidential election to George W Bush in 2004 and had been a contender for the state department in 2008, before Mrs Clinton was chosen. The BBC's Washington correspondent, Kim Ghattas, says Mr Kerry is well-steeped in the details of world affairs and diplomacy. She says he has been the Obama administration's unofficial envoy to various hotspots, from Pakistan to Afghanistan. If confirmed, he will face the problem of ongoing Syrian unrest and continuing concern over Iran's nuclear programme. Mrs Clinton has indicated she will step down early next year. Mr Kerry will have to give up his seat in the Senate, where he represents the state of Massachusetts. The Democrats may face a tough battle to keep it in the subsequent election. Analysts say Mr Kerry's nomination is unlikely to face opposition from Republicans, who had threatened to oppose Ms Rice, despite the president's strong defence of her actions over Libya. Mr Kerry himself had spoken up for Ms Rice, saying: "I've defended her publicly and wouldn't hesitate to do so again because I know her character and I know her commitment. She's an extraordinarily capable and dedicated public servant." Ms Rice's troubles began days after the 11 September assault on the US consulate. She said in a series of TV interviews that it seemed to have developed out of protests over an anti-Islamic film. But later intelligence reports suggested the attack was carried out by al-Qaeda affiliates. Her comments triggered a major political row over who knew what and when, and whether the consulate was adequately protected. The attack left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.
The article said Mr Wen's family members "have controlled assets worth at least $2.7bn (£1.7bn)". A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the report had "ulterior motives". Both the NYT's Chinese and English sites are being blocked inside China, as are references to the report on micro-blogging sites. "Some reports smear China and have ulterior motives," Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said when asked about the story in a daily press briefing. On the blocking, he said the internet was managed "in accordance with laws". Wealth gap In its report, the New York Times said Mr Wen's relatives' holdings included property, insurance and construction firms. "Many relatives of Wen Jiabao, including his son, daughter, younger brother and brother-in-law, have become extraordinarily wealthy during his leadership," the newspaper wrote. "In many cases, the names of the relatives have been hidden behind layers of partnerships and investment vehicles involving friends, work colleagues and business partners." The family's investments reportedly spanned several sectors. The newspaper cited one holding as Ping An, an insurance company which it said had benefited from reforms enacted in 2004 by a state body over which Mr Wen had oversight. It said that partnerships controlled by Mr Wen's relatives, along with their friends and colleagues, had bought into the firm before its IPO, or stock market flotation, in 2004, and held as much as $2.2bn in the company in 2007. The newspaper said both the Chinese government and Mr Wen's relatives declined to comment on the investigation, which was based on corporate records from 1992-2012. No holdings were found in Mr Wen's name, it said, nor was it possible "to determine from the documents whether he recused himself from any decisions that might have affected his relatives' holdings, or whether they received preferential treatment on investments". China is sensitive about reports on its leaders, particularly when it comes to their wealth. A growing wealth gap is causing public discontent, as are the frequent corruption scandals involving government officials. When, in June 2012, a Bloomberg investigative report examined the finances of the relatives of president-in-waiting Xi Jinping, the company's website was blocked in China - even though the report said there was no indication of wrongdoing by him or his family. Mr Wen has been the Chinese premier for almost 10 years. He is due to step down in a power transition that begins on 8 November. He is seen as a popular figure with the common touch, and is portrayed in state media as a leader with great concern for the lives of ordinary people. A spokeswoman for New York Times said she hoped that full access to the websites would be "restored shortly" in China. The BBC has also been affected, with the BBC World News channel blocked when a correspondent was asked about the story during a report, and the BBC News website blocked later on Friday. On China's Twitter-like weibo platforms, keywords such as Wen Jiabao and the New York Times are blocked. Mr Wen's name, like most other Chinese leaders, has always been a screened keyword. Some netizens did manage to post the article despite heavy and rapid censorship. A Sina Weibo user tweeted about the article from Kawagoe city in Japan, but his post was removed after 11 minutes. "The Twist Your Waist Times says the best actor has $2.7bn of assets. I just wonder how will he spend it?" asked a Tencent Weibo user registered in the British West Indies territory of the Turks and Caicos Islands. "Twist your waist" in Chinese characters sounds like New York when spoken, while "best actor" refers to Mr Wen, who critics say only pretends to be a people-first leader.
In China, police made 80 arrests at a factory allegedly making fake vaccine, where at least 3,000 doses were found. Three Chinese nationals and a Zambian were detained at a warehouse in Gauteng, South Africa, where ampoules containing 2,400 doses were discovered. It is not clear when exactly the arrests took place. The discovery in South Africa was reported by the country's Sunday Times newspaper at the end of December. In Wednesday's statement, Interpol said it was also getting reports of other fake vaccine rings. Interpol, short for the International Criminal Police Organization, is based in Lyon, France and facilitates international co-operation between police forces and crime control. The Covid-19 pandemic has claimed more than 2.5 million lives worldwide and infected nearly 115 million people, according to a Johns Hopkins University estimate. Announcing the dismantling of the suspected fake vaccine network, Interpol stressed that no approved vaccines were "currently available for sale online". "Any vaccine being advertised on websites or the dark web, will not be legitimate, will not have been tested and may be dangerous," it said Vaccines are a vital tool for overcoming the pandemic and competition is fierce worldwide to buy up available doses following the approval of a growing number of products by medical authorities in recent months. What exactly did police uncover? In Germiston, Gauteng, police found about 400 vials - the equivalent of around 2,400 doses - of fake vaccine as well as a "large quantity" of fake 3M masks, Interpol said. It released images of boxes and packages in the warehouse. Brigadier Vish Naidoo, South African Police national spokesperson, said that co-operation with other Interpol member states was proving "very effective", as witnessed by the "arrest of foreign nationals attempting to peddle fake vaccines to unsuspecting people within South Africa". South Africa only started vaccinating its population on 17 February after concerns over the efficacy of vaccines against a new variant of Covid-19. No location or further details were given for the counterfeit factory in China which was, Interpol said, investigated with the help of its Illicit Goods and Global Health Programme. A spokesperson for the Chinese ministry of public security said police there were conducting a "targeted campaign to prevent and crack down on crimes related to vaccines" and would step up constructive co-operation with Interpol and police in other countries to effectively prevent such crimes. How big is the problem of fake vaccines? Interpol Secretary General Jürgen Stock said that while the police operations in China and South Africa were welcome, this was "only the tip of the iceberg" when it came to Covid-19 vaccine-related crime. In December, the organisation issued a global alert warning police in its 194 member countries to prepare for organised crime networks targeting Covid-19 vaccines, and gave advice about how to spot fake medical products. Last month, China arrested the leader of a multi-million dollar scam that passed off saline solution and mineral water as Covid-19 vaccines. The suspect, identified only as Kong, had researched the packaging designs of real vaccines before making more than 58,000 of his own doses. He was among 70 people arrested for similar crimes. According to a court ruling, Kong and his team had made a profit of 18m yuan ($2.78m; £2m) by putting saline solution or mineral water in syringes and hawking them as Covid vaccines. A batch of the fake vaccines was smuggled overseas but it was not known at the time where they had been sent to. In a case in Mexico last month, police arrested six people for allegedly trafficking fake Covid-19 vaccines in the northern border state of Nuevo León. The suspects are said to have offered vaccines for sale for the equivalent of around $2,000 per dose at a clinic in a suburb of Monterrey.
By Celia HattonBBC News But behind the scenes, much larger deals are helping to move money at an unprecedented rate. Wealth is flowing from the mainland, through currency dealers in Hong Kong and beyond. The leaked Mossack Fonseca documents have revealed to us how the families of China's leaders keep money offshore. And now, a full analysis of the files by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shows that nearly one third of the firm's business came from its offices in Hong Kong and China - making China the firm's biggest market and Hong Kong the company's busiest office. Destabilising the economy? Mossack Fonseca's booming China business is evidence of an even bigger trend: the reliance of China's wealthiest people on offshore investments. Around $1tn (£700bn) left China last year, draining the country's foreign reserves. It is a shift that could destabilise the entire Chinese economy. And the relatives of China's leaders are among those who have stashed their wealth abroad. At least seven current and former leaders were found to have links to offshore companies set up by the Panamanian law firm, including the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, and two other top leaders. Many of these names have circulated in connection with offshore banking before, in past media reports. However, the leaked files come at a tricky time for China's leadership. Owning offshore companies is not illegal in China but the existence of these secretive financial structures raises all sorts of questions for the families of China's leaders. China's Communist officials are supposed to lead "clean" lifestyles that discourage them from profiting from their ruling positions, according to the party's constitution. And importantly, their families are not supposed to profit from their ties to the top. Willy Lam, a political analyst with the Chinese University of Hong Kong, says Xi Jinping has portrayed himself as "a purist in terms of morality and frugality". Stashing vast sums in offshore accounts "definitely goes against the teachings of Xi Jinping and also well-known conventions of the Communist Party", he says. "As to whether the offspring of senior cadres have obtained their wealth illegally, it's difficult to say because the Chinese legal system is very opaque." Capital flight The files tell us more than we ever knew before about how the Chinese elite's money is stored abroad. Long email chains reveal that Mossack Fonseca repeatedly helped politically connected clients to become offshore company shareholders without exploring their backgrounds, as they are required to do under international law. For example, Mossack Fonseca helped Deng Jiagui, the brother-in-law of Chinese President Xi Jinping, to create three offshore companies located in the British Virgin Islands. However, the firm failed to investigate Mr Deng's high-profile political connections when helping him to acquire his companies, in 2004 and again in 2009. It is unclear what the companies were used for though one had been dissolved and the other two were dormant by the time Mr Deng's powerful relative, Xi Jinping, took the helm of the Communist Party in 2012. But the irony cannot be overlooked: since coming to power, Xi Jinping has unleashed an intense anti-corruption campaign on the Communist Party. More than 300,000 officials were punished for violating the party's anti-corruption laws in 2015 alone. What is happening at Mossack Fonseca is being replicated elsewhere too. Rich Chinese are using Hong Kong as a gateway - to protect their wealth by moving it overseas. "People are worried about keeping their money in China for two reasons," explains Andrew Collier, an independent China analyst based in Hong Kong. "One is that the Chinese economy is slowing. The second reason is that the leadership has been trying to clean up corruption and there's some sense that some people are trying to move their money offshore because they're worried about the safety of their capital within China." Hong Kong has become a focal point for those who want to stop money leaving China. Last month, China's anti-corruption office acknowledged that most money flowed through Hong Kong and vowed to stop the practice, though that might be an impossible task. 'There would be panic' Around $600bn of the money that left China last year was transferred in defiance of Chinese banking controls. Every Chinese citizen can only transfer $50,000 a year outside the country. Anything more than that is often moved illegally. Some people use complex money transfers to get their cash out. One illegal currency changer we spoke to explained how he helped clients secretly transfer money abroad by keeping vast reserves of money in dozens of "zombie" accounts spread across China, Hong Kong, Vietnam and the Philippines. He uses bank accounts that are still under the names of dead people to ensure they cannot be traced back to him. "I receive my client's money into one account in one country and then transfer the currency they need into a different account in another country," he explains, smiling. However, he says he will not accept any more business from clients who want to take Renminbi out of China. "I have too much Renminbi already," he says, frowning. What would happen if China cracked down on currency traders like him and actually enforced their own rules more tightly? "Panic. There would be panic." Money mules The movement of capital is fuelled by anxiety. "People do not have faith in the ability of the financial and economic decision-making team to put things right," Willy Lam explains. "So if they have one or two million US dollars, it would be stupid for them not to at least park half of that wealth overseas. Simply because there is very little faith in the future of the party." Those who cannot access big-time currency traders sometimes rely on money mules to carry thick stacks of cash across the border. We met one man who works as a mule, who confirmed he was busy carrying money for his anxious clients. "If my customers want to immigrate or invest in a business overseas, they need my help," he explained. "Sometimes I strap the money on to my body or I carry a small bag. Customs officers always target people with lots of luggage or those who look nervous, so I just try to act normal." So why does it matter if China's richest people move their wealth out of the country? Once money leaves China, it has to go somewhere. This massive flow of money is driving up real estate prices worldwide. According to juwai.com, a real estate website that connects mainland Chinese clients with foreign sellers, Chinese buyers spent more than $52bn on foreign property last year. In Hong Kong, visitors from mainland China splash out on luxury items. This is replicated around the globe: China's richest people - perhaps even those at the very top - are spending and storing their money elsewhere. They are protecting themselves but they are making China more vulnerable. Panama Papers - tax havens of the rich and powerful exposed
The former X Factor boy band will now compete to be Europe's entry in the Worldwide Act category in Frankfurt against other winners from across the continent. Fans now have until 30 October to vote for their favourite regional act. The EMAs take place on 11 November and will be hosted by model Heidi Klum. The winner of the Europe vote will then go up against acts from Latin America, North America, Asia Pacific and Africa/India/Middle East. Louis Tomlinson from the group said: "We're so happy and incredibly honoured to have won this. Once again our amazing fans have done us proud." More presenters One Direction are already up for two awards and won three MTV Video Music Awards (VMA) in LA last month. The group scored the fastest-selling track by a non-US artist ever on the US Billboard Hot 100 singles chart last week. Rihanna and Taylor Swift top the list of nominees this year with six and five nods respectively. Justin Bieber and Katy Perry are close behind on four nominations each. Online voting for winners closes on 9 November. Taylor Swift, Muse, No Doubt, Carly Rae Jepsen, fun. and Rita Ora are confirmed to perform at the event. MTV will announce additional EMA performers and presenters at a later date. Last year's MTV EMAs took place in Belfast with Lady Gaga winning four awards.
Felix Damm was detailing the extent of Schumacher's injuries in a lawsuit against German magazine, Bunte. The magazine had reported last Christmas that the seven-time world champion could walk again. But Mr Damm said that Schumacher, 47, "cannot walk" more than two and a half years after the accident. Bunte had quoted a source at the end of last year as saying that Schumacher could manage some steps with the help of therapists and could raise an arm. At the time, Schumacher's agent, Sabine Kehm, released a statement denying the story, saying: "Unfortunately we are forced by a recent press report to clarify that the assertion that Michael could move again is not true. "Such speculation is irresponsible, because given the seriousness of his injuries, his privacy is very important. Unfortunately they also give false hopes to many involved people." Schumacher suffered a head injury in a skiing accident in France in 2013. He was placed in a medically induced coma for six months before being transferred to his home in Switzerland to continue his treatment. Very little is known of the sports icon's recovery as his family has strongly protected his privacy. In February, his former boss at Ferrari, Luca di Montezemolo, said: "I have news and unfortunately it is not good."
Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere also announced plans to speed up the deportation of foreign criminals. He announced extra personnel, equipment and surveillance powers for the police. But he rejected banning the public wearing of the burka (the Islamic full veil). And he resisted pressure to ease medical confidentiality. Some of his conservative Christian Democrat (CDU) colleagues have urged a burka ban but Mr de Maiziere said it would be "problematic" and "you cannot ban everything that you reject". Mr de Maiziere was responding to recent attacks linked to militant Islamists. Two terror attacks by Islamist migrants shocked Germany last month - in Wuerzburg and Ansbach. Citizenship debate "I propose that German citizens who are fighting with terror militias in other countries, and take part in combat operations there, if they have a second nationality - and only then - they would lose German citizenship," he told a news conference. There was a move in France recently to deprive jihadists of their French citizenship, but it did not get through parliament. German media report that the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) - the CDU's coalition partners - strongly oppose any general ban on dual citizenship. The Greens are also against the idea. "My proposals are limited to the points that can lead to more security rapidly," Mr de Maiziere said. One of the new measures is to make "promoting terrorism" a criminal offence. On deportation, Mr de Maiziere said there would be no tolerance of foreign offenders who used false identities in order to stay in Germany. Key election issue - the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin writes: Germany hasn't experienced a major coordinated terror attack on the scale of Paris or Brussels - yet. A senior intelligence source has told the BBC that his agents are investigating hundreds of reports that Islamic State (IS) has sent so-called hit squads into the country, disguised as refugees, and that the risk of such an attack is very high. Political reaction to that threat will dominate campaigning ahead of next year's general election. Already it has ignited a fierce debate, which extends well beyond domestic security. Some of Mr de Maiziere's fellow conservatives - who are losing votes to right-wing populists - want him to ban burkas and outlaw dual citizenship altogether. Why is doctors' confidentiality an issue? The duty of doctors to respect patient confidentiality is enshrined in the German constitution. And German privacy laws are very strict. But Mr de Maiziere said he would meet senior doctors to discuss how they could more easily tip off police when they suspected a patient was a terror risk. In three major cases the perpetrators were found to have been mentally unstable: German doctors who breach patient confidentiality can face up to a year in prison or be forced to pay a fine. Frank Ulrich Montgomery, the head of the German Medical Association, said: "Patient confidentiality protects patients' privacy and is a basic right under the constitution." What is going on in Germany? German press concern at spate of violence What drives individuals to commit mass killings? How will surveillance be improved? Mr de Maiziere is expected to attract broad support for creating 4,600 new national security jobs, including 3,250 more police, and for improving police equipment. Germany is also likely to introduce more video surveillance in urban areas, a special police cyber defence unit and powers to investigate suspects as young as 14. There will be a big push to intercept terror networks that use the "darknet" to plan attacks or obtain weapons, the minister said. It is an area of cyberspace invisible to ordinary internet users.
But the issue of Scottish MPs voting on law that does not affect them will get "more pressing" if there is further devolution, Mr Cameron told the BBC. All the main Westminster parties have promised to devolve more power if Scotland votes against independence. The Yes campaign says only a vote for independence can guarantee more powers. More say Asked whether there should be an English parliament, Mr Cameron told the BBC's Newsnight programme: "I don't think we're remotely at that stage. On the status of Scottish MPs, he said: "Clearly this question will get more pressing with further devolution but nothing that would happen would change the fact that the people of Scotland are being offered a chance through their own parliament to set their own rules on tax and spending and welfare." The promise of a further transfer of powers to Scotland if it stays in the Union has prompted cross-party calls for the regions of England to get more say over tax and spending as well. Conservative MP John Redwood has said Scotland's MPs should not vote on matters relating solely to England, and that English MPs should meet to decide English-only issues. 'Prior question' BBC political correspondent Ben Wright says there are huge constitutional questions about the governance of the whole UK that flow from Scotland's decision. Mr Cameron also defended the decision to put just one question to Scotland's voters in Thursday's referendum, and not to include an explicit option of more devolution on the ballot paper. "I think it was right to have one question, because if Scotland wants more devolution, and I think Scotland should have more devolution, you have to answer the prior question: 'Do you want to stay in the United Kingdom?'," he said. "That wasn't just my view, that was the view of the leaders of other United Kingdom parties who all thought it was important; let's settle the question of separation and then look at devolution. "In this campaign the individual parties have set out their proposals, they've been quite strikingly similar, so it's been possible to make progress."
By Bethany BellBBC News, Vienna That corresponds to 62 million women, the survey says. It is said to be the biggest survey conducted on the subject, and is based on interviews with 42,000 women. The report calls on EU countries to treat domestic violence as a public, not a private issue. It says laws and policies relating to sexual harassment should be reviewed. Under-reported The survey asked women about their experiences of physical, sexual and psychological violence, at home and in the workplace, as well as stalking, sexual harassment and violence in childhood. It found that "one in 10 women has experienced some form of sexual violence since the age of 15, and one in 20 has been raped". The survey noted that 22% had suffered from physical or sexual violence by a partner, but that 67% did not report the most serious incidents of domestic violence to the police. It said there was a link between heavy alcohol use and domestic violence. About 18% of women said they had been the victims of stalking since the age of 15, and 55% said they had been sexually harassed, often in the workplace, the survey found. It noted that young women as a group "are particularly vulnerable to victimisation". The countries where women reported the highest number of incidences of physical and sexual violence were But the survey noted that the results may reflect the fact that some countries find it less culturally acceptable to talk about the problem than others. "What emerges is a picture of extensive abuse that affects many women's lives, but is systematically under-reported to the authorities," said Morten Kjaerum, director of the Agency for Fundamental Rights. He said the survey showed that "violence against women is an extensive human rights abuse in all EU member states". He urged countries to take action to fight the problem, which he said "impacts on society every day". The report said that campaigns and responses to the problem should be aimed at men as well as women. "Men need to be positively engaged in initiatives that confront how some men use violence against women."
By Yvette TanBBC News Thailand's youth were among thousands on the streets of Bangkok last week in one of the biggest anti-government protests the capital has seen in years, despite a coronavirus ban on large gatherings. They say they will continue protesting if their three main demands are not met - for parliament to be dissolved, for the constitution to be rewritten, and for authorities to stop harassing critics. Many have found creative ways to protest - including the use of a Japanese anime character and a "Hunger Games" salute. Disillusioned youth Thailand has a long history of political unrest and protest, but a new wave began in February this year, after a popular opposition political party was ordered to dissolve. March 2019 saw the first elections since the military seized power in 2014. For many young people and first-time voters, it was seen as a chance for change after years of military rule. But the military had taken steps to entrench its political role, and the election saw Prayuth Chan-ocha - the military leader who led the coup - re-installed as prime minister. The pro-democracy Future Forward Party (FFP), with its charismatic leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, garnered the third-largest share of seats and was particularly popular with young, first-time voters. But in February, a court ruled FFP had received a loan from Thanathorn which was deemed a donation - thus making it illegal - and the party was forced to disband. Thousands joined street protests, but these were halted by Covid-19 restrictions. Things heated up again in June when a prominent pro-democracy activist went missing. Wanchalearm Satsaksit, who had been living in Cambodia in exile since 2014, was reportedly grabbed off the street and bundled off into a vehicle. Protesters accused the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping, which the police and government have denied. Hamsters and milk tea Punchada Sirivunnabood, a professor of politics at Mahidol University, says this combination of events has driven the new wave of protest. "The students feel like what the government has done is not really democratic. They want a fair government," she told the BBC. Disillusioned by years of military rule, protesters are now demanding amendments to the constitution, a new election, the prime minister's resignation and an end to the harassment of rights activists. The protests are technically banned under Thailand's coronavirus state of emergency - and breaking this ban carries a sentence of up to two years in jail. The movement is largely leaderless, but driven by a group known as the Free Youth. This group, says Dr Aim Sinpeng at the University of Sydney, is "loosely composed of a number of university student associations and affiliated groups… [there's] no leader on purpose". She says they've learned from the Hong Kong protests of recent years, "where these groups represent free individuals that come together rather than being anchored down by particular organisations or political parties". Pro-democracy - and anti-China - protesters in Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan have even dubbed themselves the "Milk Tea Alliance" - after the classic drink loved in all three places. And the Thais have found creative - and sometimes whimsical - methods of protest. A Japanese hamster character, for example, has been turned into a rebel symbol. Protesters have taken the Hamtaro theme song and changed its lyrics, using it as an anti-government anthem. A line in the song which says "the most delicious food is sunflower seeds" has been changed to "the most delicious food is taxpayers' money". Protesters have also been seen giving a three-fingered salute, a gesture taken from the Hunger Games film franchise where it's a rousing symbol of defiance against an authoritarian state. "Thai youths have always used more subversive pop culture forms of discontent," Dr Sinpeng says. "That's because of years of living in repressive environments that do not always allow for freedom of expression. [They're] having to always find creative ways to get around all kinds of censorship." As well as in Bangkok, small "flashmob" type protests which are easy to organise and can quickly disperse are being organised in smaller cities, driven by social media. "Twitter has really gained ground in the past few years," says Dr Sinpeng. "The trending hashtags are not only important for mobilising public participation, but it is also a branding exercise for a movement that is still forming with evolving and dynamic identities." A generational divide According to Prof Punchada, part of the issue is about the older generation not understanding what the students want. "Most of them support this government, but the young people have opposite ideas." Unlike previous conflicts between the Red and Yellow shirts - supporters of opposing political factions in Thailand - "this conflict is between the older and younger generation," she says. "There [have been] off remarks from senior officials that are patronising and demonstrate a deeply-held belief among some older sections of the population that 'kids should not defy their elders'," says Dr Sinpeng. "[The youth] want to know the elders running the country hear them and take their concerns seriously. They want respect." Back on the streets, a real fight continues to brew - but is this protest wave likely to have much impact? "The protests are not going to shake up the government too much now as they are not at the scale that they could yet," says Dr Sinpeng. "[They] are notable, but will require more momentum."
Ralls Corp, a private Chinese firm, had acquired four wind farm projects near a US naval facility earlier this year. This is the first foreign investment to be blocked in the US for 22 years. It comes as the US lodged a trade dispute against China just weeks ahead of November's presidential election. The move forces Ralls Corp to divest its stake in the projects, which were located near restricted airspace used by the military base. The president's order came after an investigation into the wind farms by the US Committee on Foreign Investments (CFIUS) said there was no way to mitigate the national security risks posed by the Chinese company's plans. The White House order said: "There is credible evidence that leads me to believe that Ralls Corporation... might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States." The order also targeted Sany Group, the company that makes the turbine generators. The military has said it uses the Oregon base to test unmanned drones and other equipment for electronic warfare. The aircraft fly as low as 200ft (60m) at speeds of as much as 300mph (500km/h). Correspondents say the development could disgruntle China, whose trade advantage over the US has become a focus of Mr Obama's battle for re-election against Republican contender Mitt Romney. Mr Romney has repeatedly accused the president of being too lenient with what he has called China's unfair trade practices. Earlier this week, the Romney campaign released a video claiming that China is stealing American ideas and jobs, and accusing Mr Obama of doing little to stop it. Mr Romney has said that on his first day in office he would use an executive order to label Beijing a currency manipulator. The Obama campaign has in turn claimed that Mr Romney outsourced jobs to China during his time as a private equity chief. Meanwhile, on the campaign trail, Mr Obama has highlighted his record with China, reminding voters that he filed more trade cases against Beijing in one administration than his predecessor, George W Bush, did in two terms. This month, the Obama administration filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization against Chinese subsidies for its car industry. The Obama campaign has also criticised Mr Romney for investing in Chinese firms.
By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter The government wants the UK to become a world leader in driverless technology. It will publish a code of practice in the spring which will allow the testing of autonomous cars to go ahead. Self-drive pods that will be tested in Milton Keynes and Coventry have been unveiled for the first time. The government promised a full review of current legislation by the summer of 2017. That review will involve a rewrite of the Highway Code and adjustments to MOT test guidelines, potentially taking into account whether a higher standard of driving should be demanded of automated vehicles. It will also look at who would be responsible in the event of a collision and how to ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians. The Department of Transport report acknowledged that true driverless cars may be some way off and that current tests of the technology will need to include a qualified test driver to supervise the vehicle. "Driverless vehicle technology has the potential to be a real game-change on the UK's roads, altering the face of motoring in the most fundamental of ways and delivering major benefits for road safety, social inclusion, emissions and congestion," said transport minister Claire Perry. The government is providing £19m to launch four driverless car schemes in four UK locations. To mark the launch of the review, Ms Perry and Business Secretary Vince Cable highlighted some of the trials that they are funding, including a fully autonomous shuttle in Greenwich and a BAE System-developed Wildcat vehicle, which will be tested in Bristol. Self-drive pods that will be tested in Milton Keynes and Coventry were also unveiled for the first time. Prof Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: "These trials are not just about harnessing technology to make our travelling lives easier and safer, they also involve getting the regulation right. "Alongside the hi-tech innovation you need policy decisions on long-term, low-tech matters such as who takes responsibility if things go wrong. As and when these vehicles become commonplace, there is likely to be a shift from personal to product liability and that is a whole new ball game for insurers and manufacturers." But the Institute of the Motor Industry (IMI) said that it was concerned that, while the government is pushing ahead with making driverless cars a reality, the service and repair sector did not yet have the skills and infrastructure in place to deal with the new technology. IMI chief executive Steve Nash is calling on businesses to take steps to address this sooner rather than later. "We believe the government is yet to fully [realise] the pressures we are under," he said. Driverless cars around the world Smartphone app The Lutz Pathfinder pod, which is being led by the UK's Future Transport Systems innovation centre, will be tested on the pavements of Milton Keynes later this year. It is a two-seater, electric-powered vehicle that is packed with 19 sensors, cameras, radar and Lidar - a remote sensing technology that measures distance by illuminating a target with a laser and analysing the reflected light. In a panel behind the seat is the computing power equivalent to two high-end gaming computers. Three pods will drive themselves on the pavements and pedestrianised areas of the city initially and, if successful, a fleet of 40 vehicles will be rolled out. These vehicles will be able to talk to each other as well as being connected to a smartphone app to allow people to hail them. Alongside the trials in Milton Keynes and Coventry, Bristol will host the Venturer consortium, which aims to investigate whether driverless cars can reduce congestion and make roads safer. Its members include the insurance group Axa, and much of its focus will be on the public's reaction to the technology as well as the legal and insurance implications of its introduction. Greenwich is set to run the Gateway scheme. This will be led by the Transport Research Laboratory consultancy and also involves General Motors, as well as the AA and RAC motoring associations. It plans to carry out tests of automated passenger shuttle vehicles as well as autonomous valet parking for adapted cars. In addition, a self-drive car simulator will make use of a photorealistic 3D model of the area to study how people react to sharing the driving of a vehicle with a computer. Research undertaken by Virgin last year suggested that 43% of the British public wouldn't feel comfortable with the presence of driverless cars on the roads. A quarter of those surveyed said that they would not get inside such a car.
Clarkson has apologised and asked for forgiveness after a clip of him reciting the nursery rhyme Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe was published by the Mirror. Although he mumbles the offending word, the presenter clearly begins by saying the letter "n". Responding to the row, the BBC issued a strongly-worded statement. "Jeremy Clarkson has set out the background to this regrettable episode. We have made it absolutely clear to him the standards the BBC expects on air and off. "We have left him in no doubt about how seriously we view this." Clarkson initially denied using the racist term, telling his 3.3 million Twitter followers: "I did not use the N-word. Never use it. The Mirror has gone way too far this time." But the newspaper responded by posting a clip of the incident - which was filmed in 2012 and never broadcast. On Thursday night, Clarkson released a video statement "begging forgiveness" for the error. This time, he admitted he had appeared to "mumble" the offensive word despite attempting not to. "I was mortified by this, horrified. It was a word I loathe." "I did everything in my power to ensure that that word did not get in the programme that was transmitted." Editor of The Voice newspaper George Ruddock said that, if it was clear Clarkson had used the offensive term, "the BBC should take some action". "If you were in a normal workplace and that was used, it would certainly call for disciplinary action," he told BBC Radio 5 live. "How often is he going to keep apologising for these things?" Labour MP Jim Sheridan, who sits on Parliament's culture, media and sport committee, also noted this was not Clarkson's first offence, and called for him to be sacked. He said: "Already he's insulted nations, he's insulted disabled persons, he's insulted people with mental illness. Every time he apologises, and every time the BBC say that they've told him to cut it out, and he's not doing it." "His whole career is littered with apologies, and I doubt very much if indeed he is sorry." Downing Street condemned any use of the word, saying that David Cameron - a friend of Clarkson's - would "certainly not" use it. The prime minister felt it was "absolutely right that there has been an apology," his spokesman said. But he refused to comment on whether Clarkson should lose his job, saying: "His view is that in terms of actions and the like, that's for the BBC". Former BBC chairman Sir Christopher Bland also rebutted calls for Clarkson to be sacked, despite acknowledging "a serious error of judgment". "He shouldn't be sacked. I tell you who should be sacked, and that's the person who released the clip to the Daily Mirror in order to give the whole thing a wider circulation than it deserved". "It's a word that wasn't broadcast. He's apologised and, really, that should be the end of the matter". "Do you think he's a racist? I suspect not. I think he's sloppy in his use of language." Production notes On Friday, Clarkson spoke to The Sun, where he writes a column, and attempted to explain the incident. "I wish to God my attempts to cover up that word were better," he said. "I was simply mumbling - saying 'ner ner' or something similar. Anything but the n-word. "It was my mistake and I apologise for not covering it up. But if you look closely at the footage, you can see what I'm trying to do." He also showed the newspaper production notes for the Top Gear episode, in which he attempted to have the offensive word removed. The 54-year-old told producers: "I didn't use the N-word here but I've just listened through my headphones and it sounds like I did. "Is there another take?" Although the clip was never broadcast on the BBC Two show, the corporation said it had received more than 300 complaints following recent media coverage. Previous incidents It is not the first time the Top Gear presenter has been accused of racism. The BBC apologised in 2011, after an episode in which co-presenter Richard Hammond called Mexicans "feckless [and] flatulent" and Clarkson joked they would not receive complaints because the Mexican ambassador would be asleep. Apologies were also made for an episode broadcast in March, in which Clarkson used the word "slope" as an Asian man crossed a newly built bridge over the River Kwai in Thailand. The use of the word - which is a derogatory term for people of Asian descent - led to complaints and the threat of legal action from Equal Justice, a law firm specialising in discrimination cases.
Heavy overnight snow in some parts of the country led to wintry conditions for voters, particularly in the Highlands. A record number of people have already cast their ballots - with more than a million having registered to vote by post. Votes will not be counted overnight after the election because of Covid. Instead, counting will start on Friday morning, with the final result expected on Saturday. Scotland's party leaders all turned out at polling stations on Thursday morning. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, who had already voted by post, was in Glasgow, which was where Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar and Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie cast their votes. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross was at Alves Hall in Moray, while Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie - who had also voted by post - was at Strathpeffer Community Centre near Dingwall. The election is seen as being crucial to the future of the UK as the result could impact on whether or not there is a second referendum on Scottish independence. But it will also decide who forms the next Scottish government, which has considerable powers over areas such as health, education and income tax. The pandemic means polling stations will feel different to normal - with voters being expected to wear face coverings and use hand sanitiser when they arrive. The Electoral Commission has also recommended that voters bring their own pen or pencil to fill out their ballot papers - although clean pencils will also be available for use. Physical distancing measures will be in place and there may be a one-way system in operation, depending on your polling place. The Electoral Commission has also warned voters that they may have to queue to enter the building as there will be a limit on the number of voters allowed inside at any one time. Anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 or who is in self-isolation will be able to apply for a proxy vote up until 17:00 on polling day. How do I vote in the election? Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election and have not been legally excluded from voting (for example because they are serving a prison sentence of longer than 12 months). People have two votes - one for a constituency MSP, and another for a regional ballot. There are 73 Constituency MSPs, each elected on a first-past-the-post system similar to the UK general election - the winner is the candidate who receives the most votes in each constituency. In the regional ballot, people vote for a party. The parties are then allocated a number of MSPs depending on how many votes they receive - once the number of constituencies already won in that region is taken into account - to make the overall result more proportional. There are eight electoral regions, each with seven regional MSPs. This means that people in Scotland are each represented by eight MSPs - one representing their constituency and the other seven representing their region. The Scottish government is formed from the party that hold the most seats in the parliament, or alternatively a coalition of more than one party.

By Kelly-Leigh CooperBBC News Their unlikely friendship and hiking trips around the beautiful mountainous landscapes of Colorado have gained the pair a cult social media following. Hundreds of thousands of people follow their adventures on the photo-sharing platform Instagram. For owners Cynthia Bennett and Andre Sibilsky, their popularity is surreal. Cynthia and Andre met in Boston, but as New Hampshire and Texas natives, the couple say they are both nature lovers who were destined to move away from city life. "We wanted to head west, toward bigger mountains. We came upon Colorado and moved on a whim, there wasn't a lot of planning involved," Cynthia told the BBC. The pair started hiking regularly and once settled, decided to extend their family by adopting a dog. Henry - a tall and lanky German Shepherd, Husky, Boxer, Staffordshire Terrier and Aussie mix - stood out right away. "He was the same age as all the other puppies but twice the size. As soon as I got into the pen to see him, he crawled onto my lap and went belly up," Cynthia explains, laughing. "Andre knew then we were taking him home. I feel like he chose us in a way." Born as a street puppy, Henry was adopted from a rescue centre that re-homes animals from other states whose shelters have high abandonment and kill rates. A mix of high energy dogs, he took to hiking and long walks straight away. A year later, Cynthia realised that she was posting too many pictures of Henry on her social media accounts, and decided it would be a fun idea to give him one of his own. It took three years to get 30,000 followers on the account. That number spiralled out of control when they got Baloo. "Henry had really bad separation anxiety when we weren't home. He would be so stressed out that he didn't eat or drink, so we decided we really wanted a buddy for him," Cynthia says. "I love to take my animals everywhere - and because of Instagram I had seen other people hiking with cats, who really loved being outside," she adds. The couple spent months looking for the right match for their unique situation. "After all" Cynthia laughed, "You can't really force a cat to do anything." An unlikely bond Like Henry, Baloo was a rescue animal. He was part of a litter of eight kittens belonging to a mother whose owner refused to have neutered. He and his siblings were abandoned immediately. "As soon as he met Henry he attached himself right away. Baloo definitely has an obsession with Henry - if I need him to calm down, I'll put him next to him and he'll just fall asleep. "I truly believe he [Baloo] thinks Henry is his Mom," she says. "For the first few months he would actually knead him looking to nurse." Cynthia believes the Siamese mix thinks he's a dog, too. "If he sees a dog out on a walk he'll run up to it, but if he sees a cat he will pretend it isn't there and ignore it. Like, do you not understand what you are? It's quite funny." Photographs and videos of the cat and dog together, with Baloo riding or running alongside on a leash, have exploded in popularity on social media. Cynthia's family, she says, are dumbfounded by their popularity. "I told my grandfather, who is my best friend. He's very outdoorsy and natural so we've always been really close. He thinks it's mind-blowing." You may also like: Andre works a typical office job in finance, but the popularity of the Instagram account has led Cynthia to scale back on her work in event marketing and focus more on updating the account and her passion for photography. The animals' popularity has led to endorsement deals, such as those popular with other online celebrity animals like Grumpy cat. "Taking a leap as an artist is very scary and it's not very stable in the long side of things, but I tell my followers all the time you are changing my life and allowing me to do what I love," Cynthia says. "It's also giving Henry and Baloo a better life, I get more time off to travel and be with them." It is not all positive, however. Popularity has brought on some backlash against the couple's alternative outdoor-based lifestyle, according to Cynthia. "As soon as you get well known, you get the other side - which has been different to deal with. "I'm like, why are you attacking a dog and a cat? I just don't get it." But she says the support far outweighs the negativity. Through the social platform they have been able to connect with others, such as people in the so-called "vanlife" community, who receive similar complaints and criticism over their nomadic lifestyles. "You just have to ignore it and let it wash over you. You just read the hundreds of other comments that say Henry and Baloo brighten up their day."
By Aparna AlluriBBC News, Delhi Unlike its American counterpart, it has not been spurred by investigative journalism. Rather, it has been a spontaneous outpouring in the last few days, amplified by journalists themselves. And it has hit Indian media the hardest. Veteran actor Alok Nath is the latest to be named for an alleged sexual assault nearly 20 years ago. His accuser, the director of a television show starring Nath, recounted the alleged incident in a Facebook post that has since gone viral. "Neither I am denying this nor do I would agree with it. It [rape] must have happened, but someone else would have done it," Mr Nath is quoted as saying by the Indian Express newspaper. Meanwhile, the association of TV actors has promised an inquiry into the matter. It's difficult to say what sparked the torrent of allegations. But it seems to have started on 4 October when a young female comedian accused Utsav Chakraborty, a 33-year-old comedian, of sending her an unsolicited photo of his penis. More allegations followed as other women replied to her tweet or she shared private messages they sent her (with their names blurred) - they said he had either sent them photos of his penis or asked them for naked photos of themselves. Mr Chakraborty, who admitted to the accusation in a series of tweets, apologised the next day. By then, more women, many of them journalists, had begun to share stories of sexual harassment and even assault. In the next three days, as more comedians, senior reporters, editors, popular authors, actors and filmmakers were "outed", the hashtag #MeToo was trending in India. The scores of tweets - in the form of long "threads" and screenshots of incriminating conversations - have set off a debate about what constitutes harassment, complicity and consent. This is not the first time alleged harassers have been publicly named and shamed in India - in 2017, a law student published a controversial crowdsourced list on Facebook accusing more than 50 professors. But this time, most of the accusers are not anonymous. And those that have chosen to remain anonymous are not alone in their accusations. The media industry Women journalists have perhaps played the biggest role so far, "outing" reporters, senior editors, authors and even a high court judge. And it's likely the coming week will bring fresh accusations. "So many allegations have come out and organisations are slowly realising that this is wrong and something has to be done," Dhanya Rajendran, editor of The News Minute, told the BBC's Divya Arya. "But this is just a start. This is the first step to give women a safe working environment," she added. The allegations have made it to the front page of national dailies, forcing newsrooms to not just take notice but also respond. At least one major newspaper has promised an investigation after seven women accused one of its senior editors of sexually harassing them and of sabotaging their careers if they did not comply; another newspaper announced that a senior editor who had been named was stepping down from his role. "There were whispers all along in the newsrooms of misconduct by senior editorial colleagues who used their positions of power and influence to proposition and harass young women, but now some of it's being articulated in the open," says the BBC's Geeta Pandey. Journalist Sandhya Menon, who has called out two senior editors for allegedly sexually harassing her, has shared numerous stories of harassment and assault from other women - many of whom messaged her privately. Since then, many more women have come forward with their stories, some of them from years ago. This is perhaps a sign of how, for the first time, they believe people are listening. "They are using their words, smartphones and laptops to speak their truth and be heard," says Supreme Court lawyer Karuna Nundy. She said it was a form of "civil disobedience" because, having lost faith in the justice of public institutions, they were making use of the tools available to them. Bollywood's #MeToo India's film industry has hovered on the edges of #MeToo for some time. In September, a 10-year-old allegation by actress Tanushree Dutta against veteran actor Nana Patekar once again made headlines but, for the first time, it attracted the attention of several people in the film industry. Patekar repeated his denial of the allegations over the weekend, calling them "a lie". Then on 6 October HuffPost India published a months-long investigation alleging that director Vikas Bahl had sexually assaulted a female crew member in 2015. It also alleged that his business partners, including acclaimed director, Anurag Kashyap, knew about the allegation but took no action against Mr Bahl. Mr Bahl, who denied the allegation after it first surfaced, has not commented publicly since the HuffPost story on Saturday. While actresses have spoken out before they often did not name their harasser or their allegations did not become part of a larger movement. Although the accuser remains anonymous, this is the first time such an allegation has been made public in Bollywood. It has also been corroborated by Mr Kashyap, who has issued an apology, vowing that something like this will "never happen again" on his "work premises". This is no minor development in an industry which has long been criticised for exploiting women both on the screen and off it. Phantom, the production house set up by Mr Kashyap, Mr Bahl and two others, was dissolved on 6 October. It produced the Netflix show Sacred Games along with several Bollywood films. The alleged victim had not wanted to speak out until now, Mr Kashyap said, so the company had not acted sooner. "Now in hindsight and after taking stock of things myself, I can quite see how I was ill-advised." Complicity and consent The allegations have ranged from awkward or creepy encounters, lewd behaviour and suggestive text messages to aggressive sexual advances and outright assault. This has prompted some women to ask others to use caution before calling someone out on Twitter for something "trivial". But this has also invited criticism from other women who have argued in favour of a stricter definition of consent. Some have said this is a moment to listen, sift through stories and introspect rather than tell women how they should process what happened to them. Those who were allegedly complicit have also not been spared the naming and shaming. Mr Chakraborty, for instance, had appeared in videos by India's most popular comedy group, All India Bakchod (AIB). Co-founder Tanmay Bhat, who admitted to the charge that he knew about the alleged incident, has stepped down from his role as CEO. Since then, a film produced by AIB has been dropped from the prestigious Mumbai film festival while a third season of a television show featuring the group was cancelled by popular Indian streaming website Hotstar. And the allegations of complicity have also unleashed a public reckoning. So, what now? Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi The floodgates have opened and what's coming out is predictably murky. Many are describing it as Indian journalism's #MeToo moment, but could it really be as potent as the movement that brought down some of the most powerful men of Hollywood? The names that have been outed, barring one or two, are of relatively small fry - the "Harvey Weinsteins" remain unnamed as yet. The strength of the latest #MeToo movement will ultimately be tested by where it travels from here - and if the past is any indication, there's not much to be optimistic about, for earlier attempts at an Indian #MeToo did not have any lasting impact. A list of alleged predators in academia died a quick death in the Twitter bubble; and calls to name and shame the sleazy in Bollywood did not find many takers. Also, it's not going to be easy for those who choose to speak out, especially for those who have no evidence to back up their allegations. Some of the women have provided screen shots of private text messages they were sent by their alleged harassers, making the allegations hard to deny. But in cases where it boils down to "your word against mine", many of the women who spoke out are already being threatened with legal action for defamation and some of the tweets, naming names, have already been taken down.
Mr Obama conveyed the message in a phone call to Mr Karzai, who has refused to sign a security agreement. The US insists this agreement must be in place before it commits to leaving some troops behind for counter-insurgent operations and training. The US has had troops in Afghanistan since 2001 when it toppled the Taliban. Its forces went into the country following the 9/11 attacks on the US. With Afghan and Western allies, they quickly overthrew the Taliban authorities, but have faced insurgent attacks since then. Correspondents say the disagreement over the bilateral security agreement (BSA) is the latest step in the long and deteriorating relationship between Washington and Mr Karzai, who was once seen as a key US ally. The BSA, which offers legal protection for US troops and defines a post-2014 Nato training and anti-insurgent mission, was agreed by the two countries last year after months of negotiation. It was endorsed at a national gathering (Loya Jirga) of Afghan elders in Kabul in November. 'Contingency planning' But Mr Karzai has refused to sign the deal until a peace process is under way with the Taliban, adding that if he were to sign it, he would become responsible if Afghans were killed by US bombs. "President Obama told President Karzai that because he has demonstrated that it is unlikely that he will sign the BSA (Bilateral Security Agreement), the United States is moving forward with additional contingency planning," the White House said in a statement. "Specifically, President Obama has asked the Pentagon to ensure that it has adequate plans in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the United States not keep any troops in Afghanistan after 2014. "Furthermore, the longer we go without a BSA, the more likely it will be that any post-2014 US mission will be smaller in scale and ambition." While Mr Karzai has refused to sign the BSA, some candidates in April's Afghan presidential elections have indicated they would. Mr Karzai, who has served two terms as Afghanistan's first and only president since the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001, is obliged by law to stand down after the next election. Analysts say the US statement clearly implies that Mr Karzai's stance will harm his country's security long after he leaves office. The White House statement came as US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel flew to Brussels for a Nato meeting at which Afghanistan is due to be discussed.
Prime Minister David Cameron said it would be "a happy and momentous occasion". It will be marked by a public holiday across the UK. The Royal Family and the Middletons will pay for the wedding itself, but the taxpayer will meet the cost of extra security and transport. The couple, both 28, got engaged while on holiday in Kenya in October. Westminster Abbey has hosted the weddings of the Queen and Queen Mother and was the venue for Princess Diana's funeral in 1997. The prince's private secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, said the couple chose the Abbey for its "staggering beauty", 1,000-year royal history and its feeling of intimacy despite its size. He said William and Kate were "calling the shots" on the wedding plans, but had a "rather large supporting cast" to help them. "We know that the world will be watching on April 29, and the couple are very, very keen indeed that the spectacle should be a classic example of what Britain does best," Mr Lowther-Pinkerton said. "Prince William and Catherine have made it very clear that they wish everybody to be able to enjoy the day with them. "Consequently, the day will be a proper celebration for the nation and the realms. "Having said that, the couple are very mindful of the current situation, and for example, Prince William has already expressed a clear wish that any involvement by the armed forces should rely in great part on those servicemen and women already committed to public and ceremonial duties." 'National celebration' The Dean of Westminster, the Very Reverend Dr John Hall, welcomed the couple's choice of venue. "We are very pleased they have chosen Westminster Abbey for their marriage and look forward to the detailed planning for what will be a great and happy occasion for the couple themselves, for their families and friends, for the country and Commonwealth and for well-wishers across the globe," he said. The BBC's Daniela Relph said William and Kate wanted to marry on a Friday in spring and 29 April was chosen because it fell after Easter and Lent and before a busy political programme in May and June. The extra holiday will fall in the same week as Easter Monday, giving millions of workers a three-day week. Mr Cameron said: "We want to mark the day as one of national celebration, a public holiday will ensure the most people possible will have a chance to celebrate on the day." The Scottish government followed suit in declaring a public holiday. The wedding date falls six days before the Holyrood elections on 5 May. As 28 working days are needed between dissolving parliament and polling day, parliament could be dissolved a day earlier than expected. Elections to the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies, some English council polls and the UK-wide referendum on voting reform are due to take place the same day. But Mr Cameron dismissed concerns that the public holiday would come too close to polling day. 'A party' "The timing of the wedding is entirely a matter for the Royal Family. People are perfectly capable of seeing the difference... a day of celebration and a referendum and local election campaign," he said. Earlier, there was prolonged applause at the Church of England's general synod when the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams expressed "delight" at the forthcoming marriage on behalf of those present. Addressing the Queen, he said: "Prince William and Miss Middleton will be very much in our thoughts and prayers in the months to come and we know that you and the rest of the family will be supporting them with prayer and wisdom and love as we shall all be trying to do." Anti-monarchy group Republic said creating a bank holiday for something "most people are not interested in" was "absurd" and that an extra day off should only be for something everyone could relate to. Prince William proposed to Kate with his mother Diana's diamond and sapphire engagement ring. Asked why he had done so, he said: "It is very special to me and Kate is very special to me now as well. It is only right the two are put together." Mr Lowther-Pinkerton said the couple were "completely over the moon" about their engagement. "I've never seen two happier people," he added. The Press Association reported that a concert in Hyde Park had been proposed to coincide with William and Kate's wedding. It said a senior royal aide had refused to confirm the suggestion but had added: "Their view on it would be, 'Let's have a party.'" Meanwhile, the Bishop of Willesden, the Right Reverend Pete Broadbent, has been asked to withdraw from public ministry "until further notice" after he wrote on Facebook that the couple's marriage would only last for about seven years. Your comments I'm throwing a big party for my ladies and me. We are going to wear tiaras and drink champs. I'm not a massive fan of the royals but it's nice when London has something fun to celebrate. Life is so dull, it'll make a nice change. Georgina, London What a wonderful spectacle it will be celebrating the nation's treasured Royal Family in a traditional manner. Rightly the cost of the wedding is borne by the family, with the cost of security being borne by the country. The contribution this small group of people make to this country is under-recognised and such events will no doubt bring considerable numbers of tourists to this country, increasing the revenues considerably. Andrew Dodd, Wallasey My fiancee and I must be trendsetters as we booked our wedding for 29 April 2011 in Dunkeld ages ago. Only the coolest couples are getting married that day. You never know, a letter from the Queen may be on the way to all us couples getting married the same day. Hope it is nice weather and an amazing day for both weddings. Martin Farrelly, Larbert, Scotland Fantastic news about the royal wedding, but poor decision in these economic times to give everyone another day off. Especially as that time of year is littered with bank holidays that could have been used. Chris, Woking I'm wondering if any thought has been given to people such as me who are self-employed. Not only do we not get paid for the Easter Monday and, because of the institution I work at, have to take the Tuesday off also without pay. Find ourselves losing out again on the Friday, in this current climate a two-day week is the last thing I need. All down to some wedding, surely it would have made more sense to have the occasion on a Saturday? G Sweet, Cardiff, South Glamorgan Congratulations to the royal couple. I hope they have many happy years together. I'm very excited about the forthcoming wedding in 2011. I'm hoping the ceremony will be televised as I have never seen a royal ceremony as I was only born in 1979. Christiane, Poole, Dorset Just found out that the royal wedding is on the same day as my wedding. I am so excited as it means a national holiday for all those taking leave! Sarah Cannon, London Just what a small company needs at the moment, paying it's employees a days pay for nothing! Steve Reading, Royton My partner and I are getting married on April 29, as a result of the royal wedding (Congratulation by the way. We now have a bank holiday to celebrate our day! Robert Walker, Kent My fiancé and I are getting married on the same day as William and Kate. It's also my fiance's birthday which should make it easier for him to remember our anniversary! I was really excited when they announced the date as my guests now don't have any problems getting the day off work! Sarah Wheeler, Warminster Who will foot the bill for the bank holiday? Struggling small firms will find this yet another burden. Is it absolutely compulsory that people get a day off with pay? Alan Crawley, Totternhoe
He successfully channelled the energies of Singaporeans to create what has often been described as an economic miracle, a mixture of private and state capitalism. Mr Lee made Singapore prosperous, modern, efficient and practically corruption-free - and overseas investors flocked in. But while he was admired for his economic success, many expressed concern over his record on human rights. Lee Kuan Yew was born on 16 September 1923 in Singapore, the son of third-generation Chinese immigrants. His upbringing had a strong British influence and his grandfather dubbed him Harry Lee, a name by which he was known through most of his early life. Mr Lee went to an English school in Singapore but his further education was disrupted by the Japanese occupation, which began in 1942. For the next three years, he was involved in the black market and also used his command of English to work for the Japanese propaganda department. After the war he went briefly to the London School of Economics before going up to Cambridge, where he took a double first in law. During his time in England, Mr Lee became a devotee of the BBC Home Service, forerunner to Radio 4, and took time out to campaign for a university friend who was contesting a parliamentary seat in rural Devon. Mr Lee, a committed socialist from his student days, returned to Singapore where he became a prominent trade union lawyer. Prime Minister In 1954, he was a founder and the first general secretary of the People's Action Party (PAP), a post he was to hold for most of the next 40 years The PAP won the majority of seats in the 1959 elections and Singapore passed from overall British control and became a self-governing state. Mr Lee took Singapore into a merger with Malaysia in 1963 but it was short-lived. Ideological tensions and a series of violent clashes between ethnic groups led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation to become fully independent. It was a difficult move for Lee, who saw the alliance with Malaysia as a way of finally throwing off the area's colonial past. He described it as "a moment of anguish". Commercial and military links with Malaysia were maintained, however, and Britain was encouraged to keep its base in Singapore for the joint defence of the island and Malaysia. Mr Lee set about a huge programme of reform, designed to transform Singapore from the "cesspool of squalor and degradation" described in one contemporary account to a modern industrialised state. Corporal punishment To do this he maintained tight political control over every aspect of the city state, making it one of the world's most regulated societies. Mr Lee detained some of his critics without trial, restricted the media and foreign publications, and arrested a number of journalists. "Freedom of the press, freedom of the news media, must be subordinated to the overriding needs of the integrity of Singapore," he said. He justified his actions by claiming that the newspapers were being financed by hostile interests abroad. Mr Lee contended that in a developing nation some freedoms had to be sacrificed. The alternative to anti-communism was communism, and the West's concept of liberal democracy could not apply. However, some of his critics argued that holding all the parliamentary seats should have provided him with enough security to avoid having to use such repressive measures. As a committed anti-communist, he was accused of adopting a communist-style regime to further his policies although, unlike many communist regimes, the people of Singapore benefited financially from his rule. From 1960 to 1980, Singapore's GNP per capita increased 15-fold. Population control Israel provided the model, surrounded as it was by hostile Arab states. "Like Israel, we had to leapfrog the rest of the region, and attract multinational companies," Lee said. He understood the importance of building a good relationship with China, something that was helped by his friendship with the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. Deng, who visited Singapore in 1978, expressed admiration for Lee's economic policies; Mr Lee was impressed with the reforms that Deng instituted in China. Mr Lee introduced measures that stamped out the corruption that had been endemic in the former colony and embarked on a programme of low-cost housing and industrialisation to provide employment. He also worked to pull together the island's diverse ethnic groups to create a unique Singaporean identity, based on multiculturalism. He was a great believer in the efficacy of corporal punishment, having been on the receiving end himself while at school. "I bent over a chair and was given three of the best with my trousers on," he later recalled. "I have never understood why Western educationalists are so much against corporal punishment. It did my fellow students and me no harm." By the time he left office, corporal punishment was an intrinsic part of Singapore's judicial system being prescribed for more than 40 offences. Mr Lee also took steps to control Singapore's fast-growing population, introducing a family planning campaign and, through the tax regime, penalising those who had more than two children. Industrial power Later he tried to encourage more graduate women to marry by exempting them from the child control policies that still applied to their less well educated sisters. Singaporeans were taught how to be courteous, how to be less noisy, when to flush the lavatory, and not to use chewing gum. There was no graffiti because the government said there should be none. "We were called a nanny state," Mr Lee once told the BBC. "But the result is that we are today better behaved and we live in a more agreeable place than 30 years ago." However, despite higher living standards and increasing affluence, younger voters were rejecting him in significant numbers and siding more with the opposition. In January 1985, he refreshed his cabinet with young technocrats, and despite the economy going through a rough patch his party continued to win landslide victories at the polls. When Mr Lee stepped down in 1990, after winning no fewer than seven elections, he was the longest-serving prime minister in the world. He remained active in politics, taking a leading part in the campaign to persuade more Singaporeans to speak Mandarin Chinese as well as English. During his time in office Singapore moved from being a developing nation to one of the foremost industrial powers in Asia. There are those who believe that development was bought at the price of personal freedom and often cite Lee's penchant for suing media organisations who disagreed with him. But Mr Lee stood by his record until the end. "I did some sharp and hard things to get things right. Maybe some people disapproved of it… but a lot was at stake and I wanted the place to succeed, that's all," he said in a 2011 collection of interviews. "At the end of the day, what have I got? A successful Singapore. What have I given up? My life."
Patrols are trying to ensure the fleet - which is made up of around 260 vessels - does not enter the delicate eco-system from international waters. Chinese vessels travel to the region each year in search of marine species. In 2017, a Chinese vessel was caught in the marine reserve with 300 tonnes of wildlife, most of it sharks. "We are on alert, [conducting] surveillance, patrolling to avoid an incident such as what happened in 2017," Ecuadorean Defence Minister Oswaldo Jarrin told reporters. There was no immediate comment from the Chinese authorities when contacted by BBC News. The ex-mayor of Quito, Roque Sevilla, told The Guardian that a "protection strategy" was being designed for the islands. "Unchecked Chinese fishing just on the edge of the protected zone is ruining Ecuador's efforts to protect marine life in the Galápagos," he said. President Lenin Moreno has said that Ecuador will hold consultations with other Latin American countries with a coastline on the Pacific - Colombia, Peru, Chile, Panama and Costa Rica - in order to form a joint regional position concerning the "threat". "Because of that [natural] wealth in that area, we suffer immense pressure from international fishing fleets," he was reported as saying in El Universo newspaper. The Galapagos Marine Reserve boasts large numbers of shark species, including endangered whale and hammerheads. The Galapagos Islands are a Unesco World Heritage site renowned worldwide for their unique array of plants and wildlife. Charles Darwin made observations critical to his theory of evolution on the islands.
In a speech, he recalled confessing to a priest how he reached into the maid's underwear as she slept. Women's rights group Gabriela said Mr Duterte was "unworthy of his position and should resign". The Philippines president has sparked outrage with a number of provocative comments but remains popular. In his latest remarks, he described entering the room of his maid while she was sleeping. "I lifted the blanket... I tried to touch what was inside the panty," he said. "I was touching. She woke up so I left the room." He said he told the priest that he later returned to the woman's room and tried to molest her again. Mr Duterte said the priest told him to say "five Our Fathers, five Hail Mary's, because you will go to hell", according to news website Rappler. It is common for well-off families in the Philippines to employ maids and many women also work as domestic helpers across Asia and the Middle East. Mr Duterte's spokesman has since said that the president had merely "made up" and "added and spliced" the story during his speech on Saturday. Rights groups in the Philippines have strongly condemned the comments, which were made as part of a tirade against the Catholic Church over the sexual abuse of children. Gabriela, a political party representing women's rights groups, said the comments were tantamount to admitting rape. "Rape does not happen only through penile insertion," the organisation's secretary general Joms Salvador said. "If it is a finger or an object it is considered rape." The Coalition Against Trafficking in Women-Asia Pacific warned that the president's comments put domestic workers at risk. "Flaunting abusive practices encourages the rape culture and in this case, sexual abuse of domestic workers," said executive director Jean Enriquez. More than one million Filipinos work overseas as domestic workers, according to government figures. Mr Duterte has been a fierce critic of the Catholic Church, which has criticised his bloody drug war that seen thousands of people killed. Latest controversy The Philippines president has drawn fire for previous actions and comments about women. Earlier this year, he sparked criticism for kissing an overseas Filipina worker on the lips during a live event. He also told Filipino soldiers they should shoot female communist rebels in the vagina. In April 2016, he spoke to an election campaign rally about the 1989 murder and rape of a female Australian missionary in Davao, where he was mayor at the time. "I was angry because she was raped," he said. "That's one thing. But she was so beautiful, the mayor should have been first, what a waste." His office later apologised.
The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has said that interest rates are unlikely to be raised before the rate falls to 7%. The number of people unemployed fell 24,000 in the period to 2.487 million. The official figures also showed the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance fell 32,600 to 1.402 million, its lowest level since February 2009. However, the number of people working part-time because they cannot find a full-time job rose to 1.45 million, the highest since records began in 1992 and double the number of five years ago. Almost a third of men working part-time were doing so because they could not find full-time employment. The corresponding figure for women was 13.5%. 'Recovering market' "It's another set of impressive figures on the job market with positive signs on all three main indicators," said Victoria Clarke at Investec. "It suggests the jobs market is recovering, much like the broader economy." "It reinforces our view that unemployment will come down to 7% more quickly than the Bank of England expects." Mr Carney said he expected the fall to 7% to take at least three years. The pound rose against both the euro and the US dollar following the release of the figures. The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance in July was revised downwards. The fall of 68,900 in July and August was the biggest two-month drop since June 1997. August's fall in the claimant count was the tenth consecutive month that the figure had dropped. 'Total complacency' The North East of England had the highest rate of unemployment between May and July, with 10.4%, while the South East had the lowest at 5.8%. The biggest increase during that period was in the North West of England, where unemployment rose by 13,000. The South East showed the biggest fall, with 29,000 fewer people unemployed than there were in the previous three months, followed by the East Midlands, with a fall of 11,000. Labour leader Ed Miliband stressed the uneven picture around the country in exchanges during Prime Minister's Questions. "The chancellor went out and said he had saved the economy," he said. Mr Miliband described that as "total complacency and total hubris... at a time when, even today, unemployment is rising in half the country". The Prime Minister, David Cameron, attacked Labour's policies. "They told us that unemployment would go up and not down. They told us that the growth of private sector jobs would never make up for the loss of [public] sector jobs," he said. "They have been wrong on every single one of those issues." 'Resilience and flexibility' Average pay rose by 1.1% including bonuses compared with the same time last year, or 1.0% excluding them, which is well below the 2.8% rate at which prices are rising. Between March and June 2013, public sector employment fell 34,000, while private sector employment rose 114,000. "The positive figures are a measure of the resilience and the flexibility of Britain's labour market," said David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce. "The further increase in private sector employment, at a time when the public sector is still shedding jobs, demonstrates yet again that private firms are able to drive the recovery." The figures for unemployment in the three months to July are based on the Labour Force Survey, in which the ONS speaks to 60,000 households once a quarter, making it the country's biggest household survey. The ONS is 95% confident that the main unemployment figure is correct to plus or minus 85,000 people.
Consuming more than four portions a week is a risk, suggests the study of nearly 1,000 French people, published in the journal Thorax. The researchers believe it could be a preservative called nitrite used in meats such as sausages, salami and ham that aggravates the airways. But experts say the link has not been proved and more investigations are needed. Rather than worry about one type of food, people should be eating a healthy and varied diet, they advise. Processed meat has already been linked with cancer. What is processed meat? How much of a cancer risk is processed meat? Experts say people should eat no more than 70g a day of red and processed meat for good health. That's about one sausage plus a rasher of bacon a day. Meat wheeze The people in the study had been taking part in a French survey about food and health, spanning a decade from 2003 to 2013. Around half of them were asthma patients. The rest - the control subjects - had no history of the condition. The survey looked specifically at asthma symptoms - breathlessness, wheeze, chest tightness - and intake of cured meat: a single portion was two slices of ham, one sausage or two slices of salami. Among the people with asthma, higher meat consumption was linked with a worsening of their lung symptoms. People who said they consumed more than four portions a week - eight slices of ham or four sausages, for example - had the biggest deterioration of their asthma by the end of the study. The experts stress that their work cannot prove diet is definitely to blame. There are lots of factors in a person's life that can make their asthma worse. The researchers tried to eliminate the most obvious ones, controlling for things like obesity, and the link between processed meat and worsening asthma remained. Dr Erika Kennington, Head of Research at Asthma UK says: "Although certain foods can be triggers for allergies in some people, there is no specific dietary advice to manage asthma symptoms generally. For most people with asthma, healthy eating advice is exactly the same as it is for everyone else: follow a balanced diet that includes plenty of fresh and unprocessed food and is low in sugar, salt and saturated fat." Catherine Collins of the British Dietetic Association recommended "a varied and Mediterranean-style diet", containing plenty of fresh produce, "whether you have asthma or not."
By Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News, Venice The protest formed quickly and without warning - a flash mob, designed to call urgent attention to the 6,000 Venetians who rely on the cruise industry for work. After 15 minutes they are gone. This year, international travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus are forcing cruise companies to delay most tours until 2021. That's meant the ships that usually tower high above Venice's historic bell towers and basilicas have been noticeably absent. Environmental campaigners have welcomed the change. They've been calling for cruise ships to be banned from Venice for years because of concerns about pollution and continual damage to the fragile foundations of the city. Traditionally known as La Serenissima, Venice is no longer "'the most serene" but rather one of the most polluted ports in Europe, according to the green campaign group Transport and Environment. Supporters of the cruise industry say the Italian government in Rome must now come up with a long-term plan - such as a new cruise terminal, outside the Venice lagoon - that will protect the city, but also guarantee the ships' future in the area. Antonio Valecca is a porter with the baggage company Portabagagli del Porto di Venezia, which has been transporting tourists' luggage from ships to Venice's hotels for the past 80 years. "When the coronavirus is finished, we need to bring the cruise ships back to Venice," he says. "This is the moment for the government to make a decision." Because of the continuing debate, the world's second-largest cruise firm, Royal Caribbean, has already announced that next summer, its cruise liners won't be calling at Venice. Instead, they will be docking at Ravenna, 150km (90 miles) to the south. Passengers who want to visit Venice will be taken there on buses. The protesters say other cruise ships could be permanently diverted to ports at Genoa or Trieste. "We're really worried about that," Mr Valecca says. Baggage handler Vladimiro Tommasini who led the recent protest says the workers he represents are tired of waiting for the government to act. "We are here today to protest because we've been waiting eight years for a solution regarding the passage of cruise ships in Venice," he says. "We ask that cruise tourism has to be compatible with the structure of our city and the lagoon. We now ask for answers from the government." Eight years ago, 33 people died when an Italian cruise ship, the Costa Concordia, capsized and sank off the coast of Tuscany after hitting an underwater reef. The accident prompted the Italian authorities to introduce a law banning the largest cruise liners from Venice - those over 96,000 tonnes. Smaller vessels were limited to five ships per day. But the law was thrown out soon after at appeal. Matters came to a head again last summer, when the 60,000-tonne MSC Opera lost control and crashed into a dock and a tourist boat in Venice, injuring two passengers. Mobile phone footage of the incident shows the ship's horn blaring as bystanders dwarfed by the 13-deck vessel shout "Get back!" and run from the incoming hull. But despite mounting pressure, city authorities and the national government in Rome have failed to come up with a plan for the ships' future, and Venice remains divided. Opponents of the cruise industry say the pandemic has shown what the future could look like, if the cruise liners were banned for good. On the same day as the port workers' protest on the train station steps, a climate camp is being held in a disused industrial site in Marghera, about 20 minutes' drive across the bridge from Venice. Banners calling for an end to fossil fuels have been hung on the walls of a large warehouse where young people are listening to speakers making rallying calls for climate justice. Flags painted with "no grandi navi" (no big ships) fly outside the camp. Environmental activist Sofia Demasi is part of the No Grandi Navi committee and the international climate movement, Fridays For Future. "Big cruise ships create a lot of pollution, a lot of problems for a city that should not be an example of the climate crisis, but of the fight against the crisis," she says. No Grandi Navi leader Tommaso Cacciari says that as well as the pollution, the ships are damaging the city's foundations, by creating underwater waves that cause erosion. "The stones of Venice are not concrete, they are not kept together by cement. It's kept together by mud and sand, materials that are very mobile," he says. "And so it causes erosion of the structure of the city. And that's a big problem." But the environmentalists face a tough campaign against a cruise industry with powerful political allies. Italy is home to one of the world's largest shipbuilding firms, Fincantieri. Last month, the company delivered the latest member of its fleet - a 145,000 tonne mega-ship called the Enchanted Princess, ordered by the Carnival Corporation, the world's largest cruise firm. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte sent his congratulations in a video message. Carnival Corporation CEO Arnold Donald joined the ceremony by video link from Florida. "We are facing extremely challenging times within our industry," he told the socially-distanced crowd at Fincantieri's Monfalcone shipyard. "We thank you prime minister and your government for your ongoing support." Mr Donald said Carnival Corporation had been one of the largest foreign investors in the Italian economy, pointing to the €30bn ($35bn; £27bn) that Carnival has spent on Fincantieri ships over the past 30 years. "Gathering here today helps us to focus on the joy that sailing the oceans brings to millions of guests each year," he said. "It also reminds us of the vast numbers of people whose careers and livelihoods depend on the maritime industry." It is not yet clear who will win the argument over the future of cruise ships in Venice, but the pressure is mounting on the authorities to reach a decision. This year, visitors who do make it to Venice have the chance to see the city as it was, before the cruise ships came. "If you walk near the canals now, you can see what the difference is. Without cruise ships, Venice is a different place and we're happy," says Sofia Demasi. Additional reporting by Vera Mantengoli
Nick RobinsonPolitical editor Few can doubt it now. It is over 100 years since a national election has been won by a party other than the Conservatives and Labour. What's more the UK Independence Party did it by winning seats not just in every region of England but in Wales and Scotland too. The impact of the result will be immediate. David Cameron will face pressure to harden up his promise to renegotiate Britain's relationship with the EU and to reduce immigration to win back the many Tory voters lost to UKIP. Ed Miliband will face an inquest into why before the votes of Londoners were counted Labour were only neck and neck with the Tories. And Nick Clegg will face demands to explain what can save his party if it is not a change of leadership. Alex Salmond will have to confront the fact that he failed in his aim of ensuring that Scotland was a UKIP-free zone. However, he'll use the result to urge Scots to break free from the anti European forces which topped the poll in England. Only Nigel Farage can be totally satisfied today although he knows all too well that winning a national election which he described as a "free hit" on the political establishment is much easier than winning a single seat in Westminster. A year ago few took that prospect seriously. They do now.
In Japan, where the spectre of public censure looms large, it is unsurprising that women are often discouraged from speaking out. A US state department human rights report notes that sexual harassment in the workplace remains "widespread". But in the space of just a few weeks a spate of allegations has led to public figures being shamed, top officials resigning and also a backlash against the women behind the claims. By far the biggest scalp claimed was that of Junichi Fukuda, the top bureaucrat in Japan's finance ministry who is accused of sexually harassing a female journalist by making suggestive comments to her. Mr Fukuda resigned last week but denies the allegations and has said he will sue the magazine that made the revelations for defamation. Following his resignation, TV Asahi said one of its reporters had been the victim of harassment by Mr Fukuda and said it would lodge a protest with the finance ministry. Suffering in silence But perhaps most interesting is how all the institutions involved responded. The finance ministry called on female reporters to step forward to co-operate with fact-finding, a gesture widely criticised, including by Seiko Noda, Japan's minister in charge of female empowerment, as tantamount to pressuring victims to stand up in front of those who allegedly harassed them. Most telling is how the female reporter's own employer responded to her allegations. Hiroshi Shinozuka, the head of TV Asahi's network news division, explained she had taken her story to the magazine after being advised against reporting it. "We are doing some deep soul-searching as regards our inability to respond appropriately despite receiving information that one of our employees had been sexually harassed," said Mr Shinozuka, who said the main concern was her emotional state. Before Mr Fukuda's resignation, Japan's Newspaper Workers' Union issued a blistering statement. "Female reporters have had to suffer silently, despite being subjected to humiliating and mortifying treatment… When a reporter accuses an interviewee of sexual harassment, the media company must respond immediately and adamantly to protect the human rights of the reporter as well as protect the safety of their working environment." But the reporter has also seen a significant backlash on social media, from politicians and even celebrities. Many chose to critique the reporter for handing in the recorded interview to the magazine. Hirofumi Shimomura, a former culture minister, said he considered that "a crime in a sense" but later apologised for that comment. Then an influential comedian, Hitoshi Matsumoto, queried why TV Asahi had allowed a female reporter to continue covering Mr Fukuda if they knew he was sexually harassing her. "If they made her go against her will, isn't that power harassment? And if she kept going for a year because she was keen on it, then wasn't it a honey trap?" The photographer and a muse The reporter's allegations came shortly after another model, known as KaoRi, dropped a bombshell on Japan's world of photography. She posted a blog about her time with Nobuyoshi Araki, one of Japan's most celebrated erotic photographers, in which she accused him of both financial and artistic exploitation, having her pose nude in front of other people, and questioned how images of her had been used. She does not accuse him of any sexual misconduct. Mr Araki, best known for exploring the boundary between pornography and art, is not new to controversy, having been accused of creating images that demeaned women and essentially of creating sexist art, a charge that he dismisses as a simplistic interpretation of his work. His photography certainly embraces nudity but also depicts explicit scenes of bondage, typically showing women bound and suspended in the air. KaoRi became known as his "muse" and features in many of his photos tied up or nude. She stopped working with him in 2016 but said that the MeToo movement had encouraged her to share her experience. KaoRi said she worked without a contract, was forced to take part in explicit shoots in front of strangers, was not regularly paid and that her nude images were often used without her consent. She claims that when she objected to the use of her image for commercial gain, she was shut down and that the entire experience led to considerable trauma and ill health. Although she did not accuse him of sexual misconduct, the allegations have raised questions once again about the relationship between an artist and so-called "muse" and the idea that art may have an impact on questions of consent. KaoRi has told the BBC that in a telephone conversation with her, Mr Araki has denied all of her allegations. The vast majority of Mr Araki's models appear to have been more than happy to take part in the shoots, but one model did share a Facebook post which accused Mr Araki of behaving inappropriately during a photo shoot, an experience which she told the BBC made her panic. She said that during one uncomfortable incident, witnesses, including editors from a publisher, were there but no one thought to intervene. Despite her strong distrust of Japan's art and publishing industry, she found some support after posting about her experiences on Facebook. The photographer has not commented publicly on any of the allegations nor has he responded to further requests for comment from the BBC. 'Taught not to say no' But neither of the women have received much coverage or public support with their claims. Kazuko Ito, a lawyer vocal about the MeToo movement in Japan, said Japan's law against sexual exploitation is way behind other developed countries. Sex crime laws were amended last June after 110 years but for her the problem runs much deeper. "Lack of legal protection, combined with cultural pressure to accept and bear one's hardship, make young women vulnerable. "Japanese people are taught not to say NO," she added, saying that it is almost as if people are hardwired not to refuse unfair demands. "What they need is solidarity across industries and societies. That will encourage more people to speak up." She also represents one woman who did come forward with her story of sexual assault, one that elicited a notably ambiguous response. In a case notable for its rarity, Shiori Ito accused a high profile journalist of drugging and raping her. After a police investigation was dropped, she took the unusual step of going public with her allegations - and has opened a civil lawsuit against the man. But for her too, initially, there was a deafening silence in response to her allegations, from both women and men, when she first voiced them. One high-profile actress was notable for speaking out on behalf of KaoRi, lauding her courage. Kiko Mizuhara wrote on Instagram: "My heart ached with thinking how much pain KaoRi has endured for such a long time. I appreciate her courage to share this story. "Models are not things. Women are not sex tools. We are all human. We should never forget sympathising each other." Additional reporting by the BBC's Yuko Kato in Tokyo.
The Fed said it was confident the US economic recovery would continue, despite a global economic slowdown. The targets for inflation and reduction in unemployment were on track, the Fed said in a statement. The central bank, which also said it would not raise interest rates for a "considerable time", has gradually cut back QE since last year. 'Sufficient strength' The statement suggested that although the jobs market is strengthening, it is still not back to normal, which is why interest rates are being held. "The Committee continues to see sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability," the Fed said. Analysts said the news was in line with expectations. "The Fed's announcement is exactly what everyone expected," said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial, in New York. "The Fed sees enough improvement in economic activity to end QE, but at the same time, it will keep low rates because it isn't yet seeing what it wants to see as far as inflation goes," he said. Several analysts seized on the Fed's comments about slack in the labour market. Previous policy statements have referred to "significant underutilization of labour resources". Wednesday's statement left out the word "significant". Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, said: "In light of the latest drop in the unemployment rate to below 6%, the dropping of "significant" could be, well... significant." Brian Jacobsen, strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management, added: "I was pleasantly surprised that they removed the reference to there being significant underutilization of labour resources. "I think that is a hat tip to some of the progress being made in the labour market." US shares were down ahead of the statement and continued to drift lower after the news was announced. 'Milestone' QE started in November 2008 amid the financial crisis and fears that the US, and the rest of the world, might be facing another great depression. The Fed's traditional ammunition, cutting interest rates, was running low - there was one more cut the following month, taking the main interest rate target down to practically zero. So the central bank began buying financial assets and creating new money to pay for them. In total, the Fed has added $3.7tn worth of assets to its holdings, about an eightfold increase. BBC economics correspondent Andrew Walker said that although the US economy is improving, the moderate unemployment rate does not tell the whole story. "There are still many people working part-time who would rather have longer hours, and many people not looking for jobs who are not counted as unemployed but would actually like to work. And long term unemployment is still a serious problem. "The end of QE will nonetheless be an important milestone in the repair of the US economy," he said. Recent data has pointed to increase spending by consumers and businesses. However, the housing market is still struggling and pay is stagnant. There is concern about the long-term impact of the US's persistent low inflation, which risks undermining consumer spending as people delay purchases in the hope that prices will fall further.
Three people were killed and 260 were injured when Tsarnaev, now 21, and his brother placed bombs at the finishing line of the Boston Marathon in 2013. Tsarnaev is likely to be moved to a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, to await execution, but there could be years of appeals. Victims sobbed as the sentence was read, but Tsarnaev showed no emotion. "Now he will go away and we will be able to move on. Justice. In his own words, 'an eye for an eye'," said bombing victim Sydney Corcoran, who nearly bled to death and whose mother lost both legs. After 14 hours of deliberations, the jury concluded that he showed no remorse and therefore should be put to death. "The jury has spoken. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will pay for his crimes with his life,'' said US Attorney Carmen Ortiz. Tsarnaev was found guilty last month of helping carry out the attack, as well as fatally shooting a policeman. As a state, Massachusetts ended the death penalty in 1984, but Tsarnaev was tried on federal charges, meaning he was eligible for execution. Tara McKelvey, BBC News, Boston Tsarnaev stood next to his lawyer. He tilted his head to the side and shifted his weight from one foot to the other as he heard the clerk read the notes from the jurors. After the death sentence was announced, he bowed his head. A juror with gold hoop earrings took a drink from a water bottle. A moment later she started to cry. Another juror touched her to reassure her and to comfort her. Another juror with dark-framed glasses and a blue shirt cried too. He took off his glasses. He wiped his forehead and wiped his eyes. He bit his lips, distraught. After the sentence was announced, US Attorney General Loretta Lynch said: "The ultimate penalty is a fitting punishment for this horrific crime and we hope that the completion of this prosecution will bring some measure of closure to the victims and their families.'' But not all of the victims supported the death penalty for Tsarnaev. The parents of Martin Richard, an eight-year-old boy killed in the blast, wrote an article in the Boston Globe newspaper last month asking the government to not seek a death sentence as it would delay their emotional closure. The Associated Press news agency reached Tsarnaev's father, Anzor Tsarnaev, by phone in the Russian region of Dagestan on Friday. He moaned after hearing the sentence and hung up. During the trial, Tsarnaev's defence team admitted that he had played a role in the attacks but said that his older brother, Tamerlan - shot dead by police in the subsequent manhunt - was the driving force. Lawyers also highlighted his difficult early life. The Tsarnaevs - ethnic Chechens - had lived in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and the volatile Dagestan region of Russia, near Chechnya. The family moved to the US in 2002. The victims Victims' profiles in full But prosecutors argued that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was an equal partner in the attack, showing the jury a message he wrote on the boat where he was arrested. "Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop," it read. Throughout the trial, the jurors heard grisly testimony from bombing survivors. They described seeing their legs blown off or watching someone next to them die. At the start of the penalty phase, the prosecutors showed jurors a photo of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev raising his middle finger to a jail cell security camera months after his arrest. "This is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged," prosecutor Nadine Pellegrin said. Reaction from Russian social media The Tsarnaev brothers were of Chechen descent. Commentators from across the political spectrum in Russia were broadly unanimous in condemning the verdict:
The hugely oversubscribed sale was priced at 330p a share, valuing the 500-year-old firm at £3.3bn. At one point, the price hit 459.75p. Private investors received 227 shares each. In all, more than 225 million shares were traded on Friday. Business Secretary Vince Cable told Channel Four News he could have charged a higher price for Royal Mail shares. Asked if he could have raised the sale price when he saw the level of demand for shares, Mr Cable said: "I could have done and I could have joined the speculators and spivs. "I'm not interested in doing that," he said. The shares are listed officially next Tuesday, but City institutions began conditional dealings on Friday. Some 10 million shares were traded in the first 30 seconds when the market opened. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown reported that its website was having "intermittent problems" due to the "unprecedented interest" in Royal Mail. Tom McPhail, the firm's head of pensions research, said it was "extremely sorry for the delays", but was making "significant progress in clearing the backlog" and hoped to have all systems running normally again soon. "We have experienced demand this morning which has gone off the scale," he said. "We now have six times the normal number of staff working on our dealing lines. We know we are not the only broker affected by such problems this morning." The price rise is likely to fuel debate over whether the sale of Royal Mail has been undervalued. Mr Cable has insisted that the taxpayer has not been short-changed by the privatisation. But the general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, Billy Hayes, described the sell-off as "a tragedy" and predicted that it would make "not one scintilla of difference" to employees' intention to vote for strike action next Wednesday. Mr Hayes told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "This is a sham, really. The company has been undervalued. "It's basically David Cameron rewarding his mates in the City. Vince Cable, one of the cleverest men in British politics, has made one of the stupidest decisions he is ever likely to make as a politician." 'Froth and speculation' Mr Cable told the Today programme that the bulk of the shares had gone to "long-term stable investors" in the UK. He said any volatility in the Royal Mail share price over the next week or so was of little consequence. "What matters is where the price eventually settles in three or six months' time". Mr Cable said: "You get an enormous amount of froth and speculation in the aftermath of a big IPO [initial public offering] of this kind. "The bulk of the shares have gone to long-term institutional investors, stable investors, some overseas investors, but mainly British pension funds and insurance companies who are there for the long term. "The objective of the exercise, which fits in with what we want for the Royal Mail, is to make sure it has stable, long-term investors." Voting in the strike ballot will close on 16 October. Under the current rules on industrial action, the earliest possible date for a strike is 23 October. In the flotation prospectus, Royal Mail warned that labour unrest posed a potential risk for the share price. Mr Cable said a strike was not in the interests of Royal Mail. 'Dazzling debut' City analysts said the price rise was driven by big institutional investors' demand for the stock. Matt Basi, head of UK sales trading at CMC Markets, said investment funds were "queuing up to make big purchases". Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital, called the surge in Royal Mail shares a "dazzling stock market debut". But he said factors such as the threat of industrial action, a lack of adequate capital and unclear growth strategy could weigh down the stock price in the future.
By Mary-Ann RussonBusiness reporter, BBC News According to mobile analytics firm Sensor Tower, the app was downloaded 2.3 million times by 31 January. The free app is currently invite-only and restricted to owners of iPhones. Chinese users are paying up to $77 (£56) for invitations from e-commerce sites and bypassing China's censors, according to the FT. Clubhouse was launched in May and valued at almost $100m. The app allows users to join and participate in pop-up public or private audio chatrooms. Conversations are not recorded, which theoretically ensures privacy, although some interviews of celebrities and influencers have been secretly recorded and uploaded to YouTube. Early adopters were mostly Silicon Valley technophiles and investors, but the app's invite-only nature has created an exclusivity appeal that has seen a raft of US celebrities join, including Oprah Winfrey, Ashton Kutcher, Drake, Azealia Banks, Jared Leto and Tiffany Haddish. But the app's downloads more than doubled in the last two weeks due to popular tech moguls like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg joining Clubhouse to participate in interviews and talk shows. After Mr Musk tweeted that he would be speaking live on the app, shares in an unrelated company called Clubhouse Media shares soared. The actual app is privately owned, meaning its shares can't be bought by the public. Freedom to discuss controversial topics At the moment, Clubhouse is only available on the iPhone and can be accessed in mainland China without the use of a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass China's Great Firewall. While many of the chatrooms are either private or have been deleted, over the weekend thousands of Chinese users joined chatrooms on Clubhouse in order to freely discuss topics that are considered to be taboo in China, from the Hong Kong protests and the treatment of Uighurs in Xinjiang, to heightening tensions between China and Taiwan. Multiple Chinese users who witnessed the audio conversations in the app's chatrooms took to Twitter to discuss what they were seeing. It is unlikely that the Chinese government will continue to permit access to Clubhouse for long, however. Monetising Clubhouse Although Clubhouse is currently invite-only, it is already offering a wide range of audio-based activities, including live DJ sets, celebrity talk shows and even speed dating. While none of this is yet monetised, Clubhouse has plans to turn popular users into influencers, according to the New York Times. More than 40 Clubhouse influencers have been invited to a "Creator Pilot Program" where they will attend regular meetings with the app's founders and be given special access to new tools. But the app has also been criticised for a lack of moderation. A December article by Vulture declared that Clubhouse was "dangerously close" to becoming a "new Internet wasteland", because conversations can easily veer off-topic from their intended subject matter and debates can turn into attacks - even against celebrities - if the moderators of the chatrooms are not careful. "It remains to be seen whether opening to the public will upend the precarious balance between chaos and chill that the young app currently enjoys; [or] whether the many celebrity regulars will stick when the exclusivity wears off and anyone can log in and call them out for takes that aren't necessarily very deeply considered," wrote Craig Jenkins. "Most important, [it remains to be seen] whether or not we're only interested in an audio app that is, on a certain level, replicating the experience of meeting strangers on '90s chat lines primarily because we're all stranded at home and lonely."
HMS Tireless, working alongside HMS Echo, used specialist sonar equipment to try to locate the plane's black box. But it was stood down after the Australian command announced there was "no prospect" of detecting further "pings" from the box. HMS Echo is currently heading to port in western Australia to replenish supplies. Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 went missing on 8 March while travelling from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. A total of 239 passengers were on board. Commanding officer of HMS Tireless, Commander R Hywel Griffiths, said the task had been "challenging." "Overcoming some of the most inhospitable sea conditions ever experienced by my crew, we searched 7,000 square nautical miles in a 16-day period," he said. "I am also very proud of the professionalism and enthusiasm of my ship's company. My highly trained and experienced young team of sonar operators were key to this operation, supported by the steadfast commitment of the remainder of my team, some in their very first months at sea." The only submarine involved in the search operation, HMS Tireless searched 7,000 sq nautical miles in 16 days. A Trafalgar-class submarine, it has been away from its base in Plymouth, south-west England, for three and a half months. The vessel worked in tandem with HMS Echo after sensors from one of the Chinese ships assisting in the search picked up a possible signal in the southern Indian Ocean at the start of April. HMS Tireless and HMS Echo used specialist equipment to scan the seabed in search of the black box, which was hoped could reveal what happened to the missing Malaysian Airlines plane. A statement from the Australian search co-ordination centre said the search of the six-mile (10km) area near the site of the reported pings was due to be completed within days. The US Navy's underwater drone Bluefin 21 will now build a 3D sonar map of the ocean floor in the hope of locating the plane.
The news came as Mr Rudd set out an overhaul of asylum policy ahead of a general election expected shortly. Australia has seen a sharp rise in the number of asylum-seekers arriving by boat in recent months. Following the news, rioting reportedly broke out at an asylum centre in Nauru. It was unclear if there was a link. "Police have been called in to help with a major disturbance at the asylum seeker detention centre on Nauru," the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported. The cause of the disturbance, involving 150 detainees, had not been established, ABC added. Mr Rudd had said the "hard-line decision" was taken to ensure border security. It was also aimed at dissuading people from making the dangerous journey to Australia by boat. "Our country has had enough of people-smugglers exploiting asylum-seekers and seeing them drown on the high seas," he said. 'No chance' The deal - called the Regional Settlement Arrangement - was signed by the Australian and PNG leaders on Friday. Mr Rudd, who ousted Julia Gillard as Labor Party leader amid dismal polling figures last month, made the announcement in Brisbane flanked by PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill. "From now on, any asylum-seeker who arrives in Australia by boat will have no chance of being settled in Australia as a refugee," Mr Rudd said. Under the agreement, new arrivals will be sent to PNG - which is a signatory to the United Nations Refugees Convention - for assessment and settled there if found to be a refugee. To accommodate the new arrivals, an offshore processing centre in PNG's Manus island will be significantly expanded to hold up to 3,000 people. No cap has been placed on the number of people Australia can send to PNG, Mr Rudd said. "The new arrangements will allow Australia to help more people who are genuinely in need and help prevent people smugglers from abusing our system." The rules would apply to all those arriving in Australia by boat from today, Immigration Minister Tony Burke said. In return, Australia is to channel aid to PNG, including to a major regional hospital and the university sector, The Australian reported. No costs were disclosed in connection with the deal. Boat arrivals have soared in the past 18 months, with most asylum seekers coming from Iraq, Iran, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. They make their way to Indonesia and from there head to Christmas Island, the closest part of Australian territory to Java. They travel in boats that are often over-crowded and poorly-maintained. Several have sunk in recent months, killing passengers. Last year, the Australian government reintroduced a controversial policy under which people arriving by boat in Australia are sent to camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea for processing. But the policy has so far failed to deter boat people, who are arriving in increasing numbers. It has also been strongly criticised - most recently by the UNHCR - for the conditions which asylum-seekers face at the camps. Late on Thursday, Indonesia said it had agreed to stop giving Iranians visas on arrival as part of the measures to ease the problem. 'Turned its back' Asylum has become a key election issue in Australia and polls must be called before the end of November. Opposition leader Tony Abbott - whose party looked on course to trounce Labor at the polls before the leadership change - has said he will turn boats back to Indonesia when safe to do so. Responding to this agreement he said: "While this certainly is a very promising development in offshore processing, it is about processing boat people, it's not about stopping the boats and that in the end is what we have to have." Human rights advocate David Manne, meanwhile, said Australia had signed up to international conventions to protect "people who come to its shores, not exposing them to further risks elsewhere". "The fact remains that Australia hosts only 0.3% of refugees worldwide and yet what we see here is a policy designed not only to deter asylum seekers from coming and seeking refuge in Australia, but one that also proposes to shift our responsibilities on to others," ABC quoted him as saying. Rights group Amnesty International's regional refugee co-ordinator Graeme McGregor said the move would be marked "as the day Australia decided to turn its back on the world's most vulnerable people, closed the door and threw away the key".
The three, who are not in custody, are also accused of deploying malicious cryptocurrency programs. A Canadian-American citizen was also charged with money laundering. The men are also accused of being part of the Wannacry cyber-attack of 2017, which crippled UK health service computer systems on a national scale. Announcing the charges, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, John Demers, said North Korea "has become a criminal syndicate with a flag". One of the defendants, Park Jin Hyok, was previously charged two years ago for his role in the 2014 hacking of Sony Entertainment Pictures. Mr Park, Jon Chang Hyok and Kim Il are accused of criminal conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud. The Department of Justice says the defendants work for the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea's military intelligence agency. "North Korea's operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of sacks of cash, are the world's leading bank robbers," Mr Demers said. All three men are believed to be in North Korea, which does not extradite its citizens to face US charges. The Canadian-American man, 37-year-old Ghaleb Alaumary, from Mississauga, Ontario, is accused of being the group's money launderer in a separate case announced on Wednesday. Officials say he has agreed to plead guilty to the charge Satirical source Sony Entertainment Picture's 2014 film, The Interview, is widely believed to have been the initial motive for the attack on the film company. The satirical film, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, ridicules North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and centres around a fictitious assassination plot against him. The men are also believed to have had a hand in the WannaCry 2.0 ransomware attack in 2017. The attack temporarily crippled UK National Health Service (NHS) computer systems and affected more than 150 countries around the world. About 40 NHS organisations and some medical practices were hit, with operations and appointments cancelled. There are broadly three reasons why governments choose cyber-attacks to further their interests: to spy on each-other; to steal intellectual property; or to meddle in politics. This indictment adds further evidence to the theory that North Korea bucks the trend. The politically isolated country is actually far more interested in making money. As the assistant attorney general put it, North Korean hackers are "the world's leading bank robbers". Of all the major cyber powers, North Korea has time and time again used its considerable skills to prop up a struggling economy. It's working rather well, too - with well over $1bn in the bank from these hacks alone. While other nations cause chaos and political noise with their hackers, North Korea seems content to quietly continue lining its coffers. The three men hit by the indictment also conducted campaigns targeting US defence and energy contractors. As part of this, Department of State and Pentagon officials were tricked into sharing their credentials so hackers could access their computers. "The scope of the criminal conduct by the North Korean hackers was extensive and long-running and the range of crimes they have committed is staggering," Acting US Attorney Tracy Wilkison said. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre said it fully supported the criminal charges. "Working with our allies we are committed to countering malicious activity by state and non-state actors and will defend ourselves from disruptive behaviour in cyber-space," said the organisation's director for operations, Paul Chichester.
By Reality Check teamBBC News They make up one-third of the total international body in the US and pay significant sums to study at top institutions. However, there is growing pressure in the US to place restrictions on foreign students, particularly Chinese, amid tensions between the two countries over a range of issues, most prominently trade. China has suggested students travelling to the United States may face heightened risks. Rising tensions The US government has been targeting specific groups of students or academics who they feel pose national security risks or are involved in alleged intellectual property theft. Last year, the US State Department shortened visas for Chinese students studying some courses, over fears of spying and intellectual property theft. Republican members of Congress are also introducing legislation to ban anyone sponsored or employed by the Chinese military from receiving student or research visas. For its part, China last week issued an unprecedented warning to its students and academics, urging them to "raise their risk assessment" following an increase in delays and visa rejections for study in the US. Analysts suggest China wants to discourage students from studying in the US to increase pressure, as part of the growing trade war. The rejection rate of students seeking to study in the US this year on Chinese government scholarships was 13.5% in the first quarter of 2019, according to official Chinese statistics. That compares with 3.2% in 2018. It's a significant rise, but covers only a fraction of the total number of Chinese students who go to America. Over the past decade the number of Chinese students enrolled in US colleges has more than trebled. In the 2017-18 academic year, there were 360,000 Chinese students enrolled in the US to take up courses. This has made them an important source of revenue for American academic institutions. On the whole, most private universities will not charge extra for international students, but there might be added fees for administrative costs. At public universities run by state governments, foreign students will typically pay the same as American students who are from out of state. Overall, international students contributed 28% of all tuition fees to public universities in 2015, according to Deserve, a company providing financial services to students. And with around one-third of these foreign students coming from China, that's a sizeable proportion of revenue generated from this source. The amount Chinese students and their families contribute to the US economy continues to rise. This is estimated to have been $13 billion in 2017-2018, a figure that includes tuition fees and living expenses, according to NAFSA: Association of International Educators. Studying in the US remains a highly attractive option for Chinese students. "There is a perception among Chinese parents that the education system isn't as good as elsewhere", says Mary Gallagher, director at the Lieberthal-Rogel Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan. By way of comparison, the number of American students travelling to China to study is small, with just under 12,000 enrolling in 2017-2018.

The newspaper - which says it obtained tax records for Mr Trump and his companies over two decades - also says that he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years. The records reveal "chronic losses and years of tax avoidance", it says. Mr Trump called the report "fake news". "Actually I paid tax. And you'll see that as soon as my tax returns - it's under audit, they've been under audit for a long time," he told reporters after the story was published on Sunday. "The IRS [Internal Revenue Service] does not treat me well… they treat me very badly," he said. Mr Trump has faced legal challenges for refusing to share documents concerning his fortune and business. He is the first president since the 1970s not to make his tax returns public, though this is not required by law. The Times said the information scrutinised in its report was "provided by sources with legal access to it". The report came just days before Mr Trump's first presidential debate with Democratic rival Joe Biden and weeks before the 3 November election. What are the key claims? The Times said it reviewed tax returns relating to President Trump and companies owned by the Trump Organization going back to the 1990s, as well as his personal returns for 2016 and 2017. It said the president paid just $750 in income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, while he paid no income taxes at all in 10 of the previous 15 years, "largely because he reported losing much more money than he made". Before becoming president, Mr Trump was known as a celebrity businessman and property mogul, building an image of a hugely successful self-made billionaire which could be dented by the latest revelations, observers say. But the newspaper says his reports to the IRS "portray a businessman who takes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year yet racks up chronic losses that he aggressively employs to avoid paying taxes". According to the US Bureau on Labor Statistics, the average American household paid $9,302 in federal income tax in 2018, on an average earnings figure of $78,635. In an annual financial disclosure that he is required to make as president, President Trump said he made at least $434.9m in 2018. The newspaper disputes this, alleging that his tax returns show the president had instead gone into the red, with $47.4m in losses. The Trump Organization joined the president in denying the allegations in the report. The company's chief legal officer, Alan Garten, told the Times that "most, if not all, of the facts appear to be inaccurate". "Over the past decade, President Trump has paid tens of millions of dollars in personal taxes to the federal government, including paying millions in personal taxes since announcing his candidacy in 2015," he said. By using the term "personal taxes", the New York Times points out, Mr Garten appears to be conflating other federal taxes paid by Mr Trump - such as social security, Medicare and taxes for people who work in his household - with federal income tax. What else does the report say? The newspaper also claims that "most" of Mr Trump's biggest businesses - such as his golf courses and hotels - "report losing millions, if not tens of millions, of dollars year after year". "That equation is a key element of the alchemy of Mr Trump's finances: using the proceeds of his celebrity to purchase and prop up risky businesses, then wielding their losses to avoid taxes," it says. It adds that the president is personally responsible for more than $300m in loans, which will come due in the next four years. The newspaper also alleges that some of President Trump's businesses have received money from "lobbyists, foreign officials and others seeking face time, access or favour" from the president. The Times says it used tax records to find out how much income the president makes from his companies overseas, alleging that he made $73m in revenue from abroad in his first two years at the White House. Much of that came from his golf courses in Ireland and Scotland, but the Times says the Trump Organization also received money "from licensing deals in countries with authoritarian-leaning leaders or thorny geopolitics". The Times alleges that the licensing deals netted $3m from the Philippines, $2.3m from India and $1m from Turkey. The newspaper claims that President Trump made $427.4m in total up until 2018 in revenues from The Apprentice US series, as well as from branding deals where organisations paid to use his name. He also made $176.5m in profit by investing in two office buildings, it is alleged. However, the Times alleges that the president paid almost no taxes on these sizeable earnings, because he reported that the businesses that he owns and runs made significant losses. The Times also alleges that Mr Trump reduced his taxable income by paying consulting fees to Ivanka Trump, his daughter and senior adviser. In financial disclosures filed in 2017, she reported receiving $747,622 from a consulting company she co-owned. Consulting fees of exactly the same amount were claimed as tax deductions by the Trump Organization for hotel projects, the Times says. Mr Trump is also said to have written off more than $70,000 in hair-styling costs as business expenses during his time on The Apprentice. The newspaper also claims that President Trump has been making use of a tax code that enables business owners to "carry forward leftover losses to reduce taxes in future years". For example, the newspaper says that President Trump's largest golf resort, Trump National Doral, near Miami, has made $162.3m in losses since he bought it in 2012. Similarly, his two golf courses in Scotland and one in Ireland have reported a combined $63.6m in losses, it is alleged. Tax lawyer and policy analyst Steve Rosenthal, who has previously worked with the Times looking into Mr Trump's finances, said the story "goes to the heart of Trump's image as a successful businessman". "You cannot generate the level of losses Trump has generated without failing spectacularly. How he continues to generate losses and continues to operate suggests he is continuing to borrow money to keep operations afloat," he told the BBC World Service. But how much, if any, damage this will do to the president is up for debate, says the BBC's North America editor Jon Sopel. This time four years ago, when Hilary Clinton upbraided him over how little tax he paid, Mr Trump replied: "That makes me smart." A lot of his supporters applauded, our editor points out. What has the reaction been? Mr Trump's political opponents condemned his reported tax arrangements. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, said the report showed Mr Trump had taken "extraordinary measures" to "game the tax code and avoid paying his fair share of taxes". Taking to Twitter, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer asked Americans to raise their hands if they had paid more in federal income tax than Mr Trump. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has not commented so far, but his campaign team highlighted on Twitter that teachers, firefighters and nurses all paid much more than $750 in tax. Unwanted distraction for Trump or more? So this is what Donald Trump has been keeping out of public view for all these years? The president's tax returns, according to the New York Times, do not provide evidence of a nefarious connection to Russian mobsters or other shady figures, as some have speculated. Instead, they show that the real estate and reality television mogul's financial empire is built on sand - haemorrhaging money, hundreds of millions of dollars in debt, and arranged to pay almost nothing in federal taxes. These arrangements will be closely scrutinised in the coming weeks, with moves of questionable legality making their own headlines. Trump has boasted in the past of his ability to take advantage of every loophole in what he says is a corrupt tax system. When he's not denying this report, he may offer a similar defence - and his supporters will probably find that sufficient. The Americans who are outraged that they paid more in taxes than the billionaire US president are probably already against him. The Times story, however, is yet another unwanted distraction for the president. Every day spent on it is one the Trump campaign can't focus on changing the dynamic in a race that appears tilted against him.
By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Democrats questioned whether steps taken to flag that President Trump's claims of election fraud were "disputed" had gone far enough. Republican members of the Judiciary Committee asked whether the tech firms should be taking such action at all. This was the second time the CEOs had been cross-examined in three weeks. They were previously questioned by the Senate Commerce Committee last month in what was a more rowdy event. Once again, the issue of a law known as Section 230 loomed large. It says the platforms are generally not responsible for illegal or offensive things users post on them. President-elect Biden has suggested the regulation should be "revoked" since it encourages the spread of falsehoods, and several of the Democratic senators at the latest hearing followed his lead. Republicans also voiced concern of their own. They said the social media companies were taking editorial decisions about what to take down, label or leave unaltered. This, they said, made them publishers rather than just distributors of information, and as a consequence they should not be covered by Section 230 in its current form. "Federal law gave you the ability to stand up and grow without being hit by lawsuits," said Republican Senator Blackburn. "You have used this power to run amok." Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, added: "When you have companies that have the power of governments, have more power than traditional media outlets, something has to give." 'Frivolous lawsuits' The two tech CEOs began by defending their record over the recent US election. But Mr Dorsey acknowledged that Twitter's decision to block links to a controversial New York Post investigation into Joe Biden's son Hunter had been "wrong", and that its failure to subsequently restore the newspaper's own tweets about the article had required a further policy change. "I hope this... demonstrates our ability to take feedback, admit mistakes and make all changes transparently to the public," he said Mr Zuckerberg avoided direct reference to the matter in his opening remarks. However, he used the opportunity to challenge recent claims by Democrats that Facebook had been slow in removing posts that promoted insurrection and violence. "We strengthened our enforcement against militias and conspiracy networks like QAnon to prevent them from using our network to organise violence or civil unrest," Mr Zuckerberg said. Bannon ban The two tech leaders were then both challenged over some of their recent decisions. The Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal wanted to know why Facebook had not banned Steve Bannon. President Trump's former top advisor recently called for the beheadings of disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci and the FBI director Christopher Wray in a video he posted to both Twitter and Facebook. Twitter threw him off its service, but Facebook only froze Mr Bannon's page. Mr Zuckerberg said Mr Bannon "did violate our policies" but had not clocked up enough strikes to permanently lose access. And when the senator called for a rethink, Mr Zuckerberg responded: "That's not what our policies would suggest we should do." Mr Zuckerberg went on to dispute reports that Facebook had forgiven infractions by both of Donald Trump's sons and the news site Breitbart, among others, in order to avoid accusations of bias from conservatives. "Those reports mischaracterise the actions that we've taken," he said. The Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein followed up with questions to both executives over their responses to President Trump's posts about election fraud, which lacked factual basis. She asked Twitter's chief whether he thought adding labels but allowing the tweets to remain visible went far enough. Mr Dorsey responded that he believed providing "context" and "connecting people to the larger conversation" was the right path to follow. Senator Feinstein went on to ask Mr Zuckerberg if he felt enough had been done to prevent people delegitimising the election's result. She noted that hashtags for Steal The Vote and Voter Fraud had garnered more than 300,000 interactions on Facebook's platforms in the hours after Mr Trump falsely declared victory. "I believe we have taken some very significant steps in this area," Mr Zuckerberg responded, pointing to information it had placed at the top of the screens of US-based Facebook and Instagram users. "I think that we really went quite far in terms of helping to distribute reliable and accurate information about the results." Voter fraud warnings The Republican Senator Ted Cruz took a different tack, asking why Twitter was "putting purported warnings on virtually any statement about voter fraud". When Mr Dorsey repeated his earlier point about linking people to conversations, Mr Cruz pushed back. "No you're not. You're putting up a page that says 'voter fraud of any kind is exceedingly rare in the United States'. That's not linking to a broader conversation. That's taking a disputed policy position." Mr Cruz added that Twitter had the right to take such a position, but only if it accepted it was a publisher and gave up Section 230's protections. And he challenged both firms to disclose how many times they had blocked Republican and Democratic candidates for office in the 2016, 2018 and 2020 elections to reveal any discrepancy. Neither tech chief would give a firm commitment to do so. Republican Senator Joni Ernst later asked what the two tech leaders were doing to monitor the political views of their staff. Both of the chief executives said this would be hard to do, but they suggested one consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic was they would have more people working from home in the long-term, which in turn should entail greater diversity among their workforce. This was a far more considered hearing. When senators last grilled Dorsey and Zuckerberg, the politicians were in full campaigning mode and it was a bit of a mess. The tone today was far more relaxed, and we've learnt more because of that. Dorsey talked of the "impossible" situation Twitter was in - being accused of overly-censoring by Republicans and not doing enough by Democrats. Both companies said they wanted there to be more transparency, particularly around the way they moderate their platforms. Twitter was in particular in the crosshairs of Republicans, especially around its policy of adding flags to President Trump's tweets. Facebook was more a target of Democrats, who wanted to know why, for example, it had not permanently suspended Steve Bannon. Both tech leaders accepted that Section 230 needs to be revisited. And it seems inevitable this law will be reformed. So the debate will now turn to what replaces it. Leaked screenshot Republican Senator Joshua Hawley said his office had been contacted by a Facebook whistle-blower and told of an internal tool called Centra. This, the politician claimed, was used to track people's use of the wider internet as well as to monitor them logging into different Facebook accounts even if registered with different names. "I'm not familiar with it," said Mr Zuckerberg. Mr Hawley expressed his frustration with this response, saying: "It's always amazing to me... how many people before this committee suddenly develop amnesia." Meanwhile, the Republican Senator Michael Lee brought up Twitter's suspension of an account belonging to Mark Morgan, the commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection. The action was taken after Mr Morgan tweeted that the wall on the border with Mexico had helped stop "gang members, murderers, sexual predators and drugs from entering our country". "What exactly is hateful about [that]?" asked Senator Lee. Mr Dorsey acknowledged that the action had been taken in error. "There was a mistake and it was due to the fact that we had heightened awareness around government accounts," he explained. The Senator responded: "I understand that mistakes happen, but what we're going to see today is that mistakes happen... almost entirely on one side of the political aisle rather than the other." Democratic Senator Mazie Hirono, however, said that independent research suggested such allegations of bias were "completely baseless". Senator Lindsey Graham also questioned both men about whether their organisations had any evidence of their platforms being addictive. "From what I've seen so far, it's inconclusive, and most of the research suggests that the vast majority of people do not perceive or experience these services as addictive [but] there should be controls given to people to help them manage their experience better," said Mr Zuckerberg. Mr Dorsey said: "Like anything else, these tools can be addictive and we should be aware of that, acknowledge it and make sure that we are making our customers aware of better patterns of usage." Vice-President elect Kamala Harris is a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee but did not take part in the hearing.
The General National Congress accepted his resignation in a session on Sunday, sources at the assembly say. The clashes erupted when protesters gathered outside the Libya Shield Brigade premises demanding it disband. The government has struggled to tackle the presence of armed militias since Col Gaddafi's death in 2011. The BBC's Rana Jawad says Mr Mangoush, who was due to be replaced soon anyway, was seen as ineffective and to blame for much of the country's problems with the militias. The army chief submitted his resignation in a closed door session of the GNC, a member of congress told the BBC. It comes as part of a wider decree, according to the same source, which also includes the appointment of a judge to investigate and break up the militias, as well as declare three days of mourning. Mr Mangoush's deputy, Salem al-Gnaidy, will stand in as acting army chief until a new one is chosen, Reuters news agency reports. Army takeover A doctor at Benghazi's main hospital says that some of the deaths were caused by gunshot wounds to the chest and that there were six cases of amputations among the dozens of people injured. Following Saturday's violence, the Libyan army said it would take control of all bases run by the Libya Shield Brigade in Benghazi. The main headquarters, where the clashes took place, is already in the hands of a special forces unit in the city, an army spokesman said. While it is not clear what the handover means in the long-term, it is clear that officials have not used the word "dismantle" - a key demand of the protesters - our correspondent says. The government has also promised to follow investigations into the incident closely and a GNC statement said it was saddened by the events. However, the Congress did not issue any direct criticism towards the Libya Shield Brigade, which will be seen by many as the authorities tip-toeing around the issue of militias and semi-autonomous brigades, our correspondent adds. It also illustrates the weakness of the government in facing the matter head on, she says. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Benghazi last year to eject a number of armed groups that they blamed for continuing lawlessness in the city. This followed an attack on the US consulate in Benghazi that killed four people, including US ambassador Chris Stevens. Some officials blamed the attack on some of the largest brigades in the city, saying they were operating under the ministry of defence, our correspondent says. Growing resentment towards armed militias was compounded after militiamen laid siege to various government ministries in Tripoli in April.
By Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News, Venice The protest formed quickly and without warning - a flash mob, designed to call urgent attention to the 6,000 Venetians who rely on the cruise industry for work. After 15 minutes they are gone. This year, international travel restrictions caused by the coronavirus are forcing cruise companies to delay most tours until 2021. That's meant the ships that usually tower high above Venice's historic bell towers and basilicas have been noticeably absent. Environmental campaigners have welcomed the change. They've been calling for cruise ships to be banned from Venice for years because of concerns about pollution and continual damage to the fragile foundations of the city. Traditionally known as La Serenissima, Venice is no longer "'the most serene" but rather one of the most polluted ports in Europe, according to the green campaign group Transport and Environment. Supporters of the cruise industry say the Italian government in Rome must now come up with a long-term plan - such as a new cruise terminal, outside the Venice lagoon - that will protect the city, but also guarantee the ships' future in the area. Antonio Valecca is a porter with the baggage company Portabagagli del Porto di Venezia, which has been transporting tourists' luggage from ships to Venice's hotels for the past 80 years. "When the coronavirus is finished, we need to bring the cruise ships back to Venice," he says. "This is the moment for the government to make a decision." Because of the continuing debate, the world's second-largest cruise firm, Royal Caribbean, has already announced that next summer, its cruise liners won't be calling at Venice. Instead, they will be docking at Ravenna, 150km (90 miles) to the south. Passengers who want to visit Venice will be taken there on buses. The protesters say other cruise ships could be permanently diverted to ports at Genoa or Trieste. "We're really worried about that," Mr Valecca says. Baggage handler Vladimiro Tommasini who led the recent protest says the workers he represents are tired of waiting for the government to act. "We are here today to protest because we've been waiting eight years for a solution regarding the passage of cruise ships in Venice," he says. "We ask that cruise tourism has to be compatible with the structure of our city and the lagoon. We now ask for answers from the government." Eight years ago, 33 people died when an Italian cruise ship, the Costa Concordia, capsized and sank off the coast of Tuscany after hitting an underwater reef. The accident prompted the Italian authorities to introduce a law banning the largest cruise liners from Venice - those over 96,000 tonnes. Smaller vessels were limited to five ships per day. But the law was thrown out soon after at appeal. Matters came to a head again last summer, when the 60,000-tonne MSC Opera lost control and crashed into a dock and a tourist boat in Venice, injuring two passengers. Mobile phone footage of the incident shows the ship's horn blaring as bystanders dwarfed by the 13-deck vessel shout "Get back!" and run from the incoming hull. But despite mounting pressure, city authorities and the national government in Rome have failed to come up with a plan for the ships' future, and Venice remains divided. Opponents of the cruise industry say the pandemic has shown what the future could look like, if the cruise liners were banned for good. On the same day as the port workers' protest on the train station steps, a climate camp is being held in a disused industrial site in Marghera, about 20 minutes' drive across the bridge from Venice. Banners calling for an end to fossil fuels have been hung on the walls of a large warehouse where young people are listening to speakers making rallying calls for climate justice. Flags painted with "no grandi navi" (no big ships) fly outside the camp. Environmental activist Sofia Demasi is part of the No Grandi Navi committee and the international climate movement, Fridays For Future. "Big cruise ships create a lot of pollution, a lot of problems for a city that should not be an example of the climate crisis, but of the fight against the crisis," she says. No Grandi Navi leader Tommaso Cacciari says that as well as the pollution, the ships are damaging the city's foundations, by creating underwater waves that cause erosion. "The stones of Venice are not concrete, they are not kept together by cement. It's kept together by mud and sand, materials that are very mobile," he says. "And so it causes erosion of the structure of the city. And that's a big problem." But the environmentalists face a tough campaign against a cruise industry with powerful political allies. Italy is home to one of the world's largest shipbuilding firms, Fincantieri. Last month, the company delivered the latest member of its fleet - a 145,000 tonne mega-ship called the Enchanted Princess, ordered by the Carnival Corporation, the world's largest cruise firm. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte sent his congratulations in a video message. Carnival Corporation CEO Arnold Donald joined the ceremony by video link from Florida. "We are facing extremely challenging times within our industry," he told the socially-distanced crowd at Fincantieri's Monfalcone shipyard. "We thank you prime minister and your government for your ongoing support." Mr Donald said Carnival Corporation had been one of the largest foreign investors in the Italian economy, pointing to the €30bn ($35bn; £27bn) that Carnival has spent on Fincantieri ships over the past 30 years. "Gathering here today helps us to focus on the joy that sailing the oceans brings to millions of guests each year," he said. "It also reminds us of the vast numbers of people whose careers and livelihoods depend on the maritime industry." It is not yet clear who will win the argument over the future of cruise ships in Venice, but the pressure is mounting on the authorities to reach a decision. This year, visitors who do make it to Venice have the chance to see the city as it was, before the cruise ships came. "If you walk near the canals now, you can see what the difference is. Without cruise ships, Venice is a different place and we're happy," says Sofia Demasi. Additional reporting by Vera Mantengoli
Under the treaty, a UN body sets lower international rates for packages from certain countries, a move originally designed to support poorer nations. But the US says the discounts put American businesses at a disadvantage. Officials said they hoped the notice of withdrawal would set the stage to agree a better deal. "We're looking for a fair system," a senior administration official told reporters. "We do hope that ultimately we achieve a negotiated outcome." The BBC's Asia business correspondent Karishma Vaswani says the move to pull out of the treaty is aimed at forcing the Chinese to give up the developing nation status they had when they first entered the pact back in 1969. How does the system currently work? International mailing rates are governed by the Universal Postal Union (UPU), a unit of the United Nations that traces its roots back to the 1870s. It subsidises shipments from developing countries while setting higher rates for wealthier nations, including the US. But the White House said China - a major global exporter - was now the biggest beneficiary of that system. The US wants changes to the postal treaty to allow countries to set their own rates for parcels weighing under 2kg (4.4lbs). They are already allowed to do so for bigger packages. The rise of international online shopping has led to a huge increase in the number of small parcels being sent via the postal system. American firms say it can cost significantly more to post an item within the US than it does to send the same item to the US from China. What is the US argument? The bid to overhaul the treaty is part of US President Donald Trump's combative "America First" approach to trade, which has led to tariffs on billions of dollars in goods, attacks on existing trade treaties and criticism of multilateral agreements. He has frequently singled out China, which exports more goods to the US than any other country. Officials said the discounts strain the finances of the US Postal Service, facilitate the shipment of counterfeit goods and distort pricing within the US, leading to higher fees for domestic companies. Due to lower rates, foreign packages cost the US about $300m (£228.5m) each year, according to administration estimates. The process of withdrawing from the treaty takes at least a year and the White House said it would be willing to remain in the UPU if negotiations were successful. The US Postal Service and companies such as Amazon and FedEx have complained about the discounts for foreign shippers for many years.
Police suspect the skins found at a farm in Benoni last week came from illegally slaughtered animals whose hides were destined for China. They described the raid as a major breakthrough against smugglers. Trade in donkey skins is worth millions of dollars, with hides prized in China for supposed medicinal properties. The gelatine in the hides is used as a medicinal tonic, with some believing it can slow down menopause in women. It is also used to try to treat conditions such as insomnia and poor circulation. The raid in Benoni followed a tip-off from a woman who had complained about the smell of rotting meat. Police did not make any arrests at the farm but have said the raid provided important new information about a syndicate suspected of slaughtering the animals and transporting the meat and hides, without them being certified disease-free. South Africa's Mail & Guardian newspaper said Chinese nationals were suspected of involvement. 'Bludgeoned with hammers' On Monday, the paper reported that a site where more than 100 donkeys were illegally slaughtered had been discovered on a farm in Olifantshoek, in the Northern Cape. The South African National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) spoke of animals there "being bludgeoned with hammers and being skinned alive". It called practices there "barbaric and inhumane" and criticised the government for "doing very little to end this illegal practice". The Mail & Guardian quoted NSPCA inspector Mpho Mokoena as saying a suspect arrested at Olifantshoek had said skins there were transported to Benoni, suggesting a link between the two sites. Police say donkey theft, slaughter and animal skin sales have been rising in South Africa since 2015. Last year, Burkina Faso banned the export of donkey skins and Niger the export of donkeys saying a sharp increase in trade to Asian countries was threatening their donkey populations.
A not-guilty plea was entered on the two-time Oscar winner's behalf by his lawyers during the hearing in the US state of Massachusetts. He is accused of sexually assaulting an 18-year-old male after plying him with alcohol at a bar in Nantucket in 2016. Assault claims against him have also surfaced in London and Los Angeles. What happened in court? Mr Spacey, 59, was mobbed by media as he arrived at the packed courtroom on the normally sleepy resort island of Nantucket on Monday after arriving by private jet. The actor nodded when Judge Thomas Barrett told him he was not allowed to contact the alleged victim. A lawyer for Spacey - whose legal name is Kevin S Fowler - had earlier asked the judge to allow the hearing to happen without the defendant present, but that request was refused. He was released without having to pay bail after a 10-minute hearing. The judge scheduled the next court date for 4 March. If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison. What are the charges? Prosecutors announced on 24 December that Mr Spacey would be charged with indecent assault and battery stemming from an incident at the Club Car restaurant in Nantucket. The alleged victim is the son of former Boston local television news presenter Heather Unruh, who spoke publicly about the case last year. She accused Mr Spacey of buying her then 18-year-old son alcohol - the drinking age in Massachusetts is 21 - and then groping him. The man, who is also suing Mr Spacey in civil court, will not be present during the criminal trial. According to prosecutors, the teenager told police that the actor had groped him as they stood together at a piano. He told police that he had video of the incident, and had sent a clip via the Snapchat app to his girlfriend. Mr Spacey's legal team say the video does not prove his guilt. During Monday's hearing, his lawyer Alan Jackson successfully argued the alleged victim must not delete material from his phone. No courtroom theatre Nick Bryant, BBC News, Nantucket This was a journey Kevin Spacey didn't want to make, and having touched down on this jet set island in a private plane, he waited on the tarmac until the final moment before making the short drive to his first appearance in court. His legal team argued he shouldn't have to appear in person, because of the negative publicity that's already surrounded this case. But the actor who's spent so much of his working life in front of the cameras, found it impossible today to avoid them. He entered by a side entrance, outfoxing some of the camera operators and photographers who had staked out positions over the weekend, but by no means all of them. A camera was also allowed into the courtroom to provide a live stream of the proceedings and to record the charge levelled against him - a charge he denies. During this short hearing, the actor briefly shared a joke with his lawyer but did not address the court. Dressed in a grey suit with polka-dot tie and patterned shirt, he spent most of the time peering benignly ahead at the judge, displaying no outward emotion. The small courtroom was packed with journalists and local onlookers - including some who had taken the ferry from the mainland to watch the proceedings. Many seemed rather disappointed that all they got to see was deliberations between the legal teams and the judge rather than hearing from the more central figure. But this now is a legal process, rather than courtroom theatre. What were the other allegations? The actor's career offers dried up after he was accused by actor Anthony Rapp in 2017 of making a sexual advance on him in 1986 when Mr Rapp was 14 years old. Mr Spacey said he had no memory of the event, but publicly apologised before issuing an "absolute" denial of all other allegations. In September last year, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said Mr Spacey would not be prosecuted over an accusation of sexual assault that allegedly took place in 1992. It said it fell outside of California's statute of limitations. UK police are also investigating several allegations that centre around Mr Spacey's time serving as artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre. The controversy has led to the actor being axed from a number of roles, including Netflix series House of Cards and the 2017 film All the Money in the World, which was re-shot without him. On Christmas Eve, Mr Spacey posted a video contesting the allegations against him. In the clip titled "Let Me Be Frank", Mr Spacey appeared as his character Frank Underwood from House of Cards, and said: "I'm certainly not going to pay the price for the thing I didn't do."
The claims of unwanted kissing and touching have been published in the New Yorker magazine. In a statement, CBS said it was looking into the allegations and would "take appropriate action". Mr Moonves, 68, told the magazine that he "may have made some women uncomfortable" in the past. "Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely," he said. "But I always understood and respected... that 'no' means 'no,' and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone's career." CBS' stock price dropped by 6% on Friday as reports of the New Yorker article trickled out. The exposé is by Ronan Farrow, who this year won a Pulitzer Prize for detailing assault accusations against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Some of the alleged incidents are said to have occurred more than 20 years ago. In a statement, CBS said: "All allegations of personal misconduct are to be taken seriously. "The Independent Directors of CBS have committed to investigating claims that violate the Company's clear policies in that regard. "Upon the conclusion of that investigation, which involves recently reported allegations that go back several decades, the Board will promptly review the findings and take appropriate action." Mr Moonves, who is chairman and chief executive of CBS, has yet to respond to BBC requests for comment. Six women have made allegations against him, including the actress Illeana Douglas who told the New Yorker that he violently kissed her. "The physicality of it was horrendous," she said. "You think, how long is this going to go on? I couldn't get him off me." All of the women say they believe their careers suffered because they rejected his advances. A CBS statement on behalf of Mr Moonves said he acknowledged trying to kiss Ms Douglas but denied sexual assault and intimidation. Earlier this year, CBS' fired veteran presenter Charlie Rose, who was accused of sexual harassment by a number of women, including several CBS employees. Mr Moonves has long been considered one of the most powerful men in Hollywood, helping steer the network broadcaster into the digital age. Media colossus Analysis by James Cook, BBC Los Angeles He started out as a TV actor before developing Friends and ER with Warner Bros and then reviving an ailing CBS with hits including CSI, Everybody Loves Raymond and, most recently, The Big Bang Theory. For a decade under his leadership, CBS has been the most-watched network in the US, narrowly retaining its crown ahead of NBC in the 2017-18 season. Mr Moonves earned $69.3m (£53m) in 2017 making him one of the highest paid chief executives in the world. But his tenure at the top of the network, which he joined in 1995, has been marked by a power struggle with Shari Redstone who, through her family's business National Amusements, is the controlling shareholder in both CBS and the media conglomerate, Viacom. Ms Redstone and Mr Moonves are currently battling in the courts as he tries to thwart her plan to merge the two companies. He has been married to Julie Chen - host of CBS' Big Brother - since 2004. The two wed less than two weeks after he finalised his divorce from Nancy Wiesenfeld, to whom he had been married since 1978, according to the Hollywood Reporter. During the 2016 presidential election, he was criticised for saying Donald Trump's candidacy "may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS". "The money's rolling in and this is fun," he said at a media event in San Francisco.
By Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi Mumbai businessman Raphael Samuel told the BBC that it's wrong to bring children into the world because they then have to put up with lifelong suffering. Mr Samuel, of course, understands that our consent can't be sought before we are born, but insists that "it was not our decision to be born". So as we didn't ask to be born, we should be paid for the rest of our lives to live, he argues. A demand like this could cause a rift within any family, but Mr Samuel says he gets along very well with his parents (both of whom are lawyers) and they appear to be dealing with it with a lot of humour. In a statement, his mother Kavita Karnad Samuel explained her response to "the recent upheaval my son has created". "I must admire my son's temerity to want to take his parents to court knowing both of us are lawyers. And if Raphael could come up with a rational explanation as to how we could have sought his consent to be born, I will accept my fault," she said. Mr Samuel's belief is rooted in what's called anti-natalism - a philosophy that argues that life is so full of misery that people should stop procreating immediately. This, he says, would gradually phase out humanity from the Earth and that would also be so much better for the planet. "There's no point to humanity. So many people are suffering. If humanity is extinct, Earth and animals would be happier. They'll certainly be better off. Also no human will then suffer. Human existence is totally pointless." A year ago, he created a Facebook page, Nihilanand, which features posters that show his images with a huge fake beard, an eye-mask and anti-natalist messages like "Isn't forcing a child into this world and forcing it to have a career, kidnapping, and slavery?" Or, "Your parents had you instead of a toy or a dog, you owe them nothing, you are their entertainment." You might also be interested in: Mr Samuel says he remembers first having anti-natalist thoughts when he was five. "I was a normal kid. One day I was very frustrated and I didn't want to go to school but my parents kept asking me to go. So I asked them: 'Why did you have me?' And my dad had no answer. I think if he'd been able to answer, maybe I wouldn't have thought this way." As the idea grew and took shape in his mind, he decided to tell his parents about it. He says his mum reacted "very well" and dad too "is warming up" to the idea. "Mum said she wished she had met me before I was born and that if she did, she definitely wouldn't have had me," he says laughing and adds that she does see reason in his argument. "She told me that she was quite young when she had me and that she didn't know she had another option. But that's what I'm trying to say - everyone has the option." In her statement, his mother also said it was unfair to focus on a "sliver of what he believes in". "His belief in anti-natalism, his concern for the burden on Earth's resources due to needless life, his sensitivity toward the pain experienced unwittingly by children while growing up and so much more has been ruefully forgotten. "I'm very happy that my son has grown up into a fearless, independent-thinking young man. He is sure to find his path to happiness." Mr Samuel says his decision to take his parents to court is only based on his belief that the world would be a much better place without human beings in it. So six months ago, one day at breakfast, he told his mother that he was planning to sue her. "She said that's fine, but don't expect me to go easy on you. I will destroy you in court." Mr Samuel is now looking for a lawyer to take up his case, but so far he's not had much success. "I know it's going to be thrown out because no judge would hear it. But I do want to file a case because I want to make a point." His Facebook posts have also attracted a lot of responses, "some positive, but mostly negative" with some even advising him to "go kill yourself". He has also had worried mums asking him what would happen if their children see his posts. "Some argue logically, some are offended and some are offensive. To those abusing me, let them abuse me. But I also hear from many who say they support me but can't say this publicly for whatever reasons. I ask them to come out and speak up," he says. His critics also say that he's doing this to get some publicity. "I'm not really doing this for publicity," he says, "but I do want the idea to go public. This simple idea that it's okay to not have a child." I ask him if he is unhappy being born. "I wish I was not born. But it's not that I'm unhappy in my life. My life is good, but I'd rather not be here. You know it's like there's a nice room, but I don't want to be in that room," he explains.
The couple, who died in 2013, had frozen several embryos hoping to have a child through IVF. After the accident, their parents fought a protracted legal battle to be allowed to use the embryos. The boy was born in December to a surrogate from Laos and The Beijing News first reported the case this week. The newspaper explained how the lack of precedent for a case of this kind had forced the deceased couple's parents through a legal minefield before the surrogacy could proceed. No precedent At the time of the accident, the embryos were stored safely in a Nanjing hospital, frozen at minus 196 degrees in a liquid nitrogen tank. A court battle gave the four grandparents-to-be the right over the fertilised eggs. There was no precedent as to whether they could inherit their children's frozen embryos, according to reports. They were eventually granted the embryos, but it wasn't long until the next problem occurred. The embryos could only be taken from the Nanjing hospital if there was proof that another hospital would store them. But given the legal uncertainty around untransplanted embryos, it was hard to find another medical institution in China willing to get involved. And with surrogacy illegal in China, the only realistic option was to look beyond the country's borders. Proving paternity and nationality Eventually, the future grandparents worked with a surrogacy agency and decided on Laos, where commercial surrogacy was legal. As no airline was willing to accept a thermos-sized bottle of liquid nitrogen, the precious cargo had to be transported by car. In Laos, the embryo was implanted into the womb of the surrogate mother and in December 2017 the boy was born. Citizenship of the child, named Tiantian, was another problem though and so he was born not in Laos but in China - with the surrogate travelling there on a simple tourist visa. With no parents left to prove paternity, all four grandparents had to give blood and take DNA tests to establish that the baby was indeed their grandson and that both parents had been Chinese nationals.
Seventeen tourists were killed in the attack, including visitors from Japan, Italy, Colombia, Australia, France, Poland and Spain, officials said. Two Tunisians, one a police officer, were also killed in Wednesday's attack. Security forces have killed two gunmen but are continuing the search for accomplices. Officials say that more than 40 people, including tourists and Tunisians, were injured. 'Democracy will win' President Beji Caid Essebsi said the country was "in a war with terror". "These monstrous minorities do not frighten us," he said in remarks broadcast on national TV. "We will resist them until the deepest end without mercy. "Democracy will win and it will survive." Prime Minister Habib Essid said: "It is a critical moment in our history, and a defining moment for our future." At the time of the attack, deputies in the neighbouring parliamentary building were discussing anti-terrorism legislation. Parliament was evacuated, but later reconvened for an extraordinary session in the evening. Many Tunisians took to the streets of central Tunis to protest against the attack, waving flags and lighting candles outside the museum. World leaders condemned the attack and expressed their support for Tunisia's counter-terrorism efforts. The UN Security Council issued a statement saying no terrorist action could reverse Tunisia's path towards democracy. The statement offered condolences to those affected by the attack, and called for the perpetrators to be brought to justice. Meanwhile, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said the US would "continue to stand with our Tunisian partners against terrorist violence". EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini offered her condolences (in French) to the victims' families, and said the EU would "fully support Tunisia in the fight against terrorism". Who were the victims? According to Prime Minister Essid, 19 people were killed. However, some of the countries involved have different totals. The attack is a huge blow for Tunisia's tourism industry and its government, which only emerged at the end of a long political transition several months ago, the BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher says. Islamist militants have tried to derail the democratic transition, which, although fragile, remains the most positive result of the Arab Spring in the Middle East, our correspondent adds. Tourism is a key sector of Tunisia's economy, with large numbers of Europeans visiting the country's resorts. In 2002, 19 people, including 11 German tourists, were killed in a bomb blast at a synagogue in the resort of Djerba. Al-Qaeda said it had carried out that attack. Concerns about security in Tunisia have increased in recent months as neighbouring Libya has become increasingly unstable. A large number of Tunisians have also left to fight in Syria and Iraq, triggering worries that returning militants could carry out attacks at home. The Bardo National Museum Are you in the area?

The government has been accused of brutally oppressing citizens while ruthlessly pursuing the development of nuclear weapons. In the past year it held its fifth nuclear test, launched several missiles and - most believe - assassinated its leader's half-brother using a chemical weapon. Most recently, it has conducted its first test of what it claims is an inter-continental ballistic missile, a move that - if verified - increases the threat it can pose to its enemies and ratchets up international tensions. But why is North Korea such a problem - and why can no solution be found? A potted history The US and the Soviets divided Korea into two at the end of World War Two. Reunification talks failed and by 1948 there were two separate governments. The 1950-53 Korean War entrenched the split. North Korea's first leader was Kim Il-sung, a communist who presided over a one-party state, and the grandfather of current leader Kim Jong-un. It remains one of the world's poorest nations. Its economy is centrally controlled, its citizens have no access to external media and, apart from a privileged few, no freedom to leave. Most worryingly, it has conducted five nuclear and multiple missile tests that demonstrate progress towards its ultimate goal of building a nuclear missile. So what about negotiations? There have been several rounds. The most recent, involving China, South Korea, Japan, Russia and the US, initially looked promising. Pyongyang agreed to give up its nuclear work in return for aid and political concessions. It went as far as blowing up the cooling tower at its plutonium production facility at Yongbyon. But then things faltered. The US said North Korea was failing to disclose the full extent of its nuclear work. Pyongyang denied this, but then conducted a nuclear test. So, since 2009, there have been no meaningful discussions. John Nilsson-Wright, senior fellow for north-east Asia at think-tank Chatham House, says that North Korea, judging from its recent provocations, is not interested in negotiating at the moment. "This is because Kim is determined to push forward on military modernisation, so rationally it is in his interests to delay." But economic pressure would work, right? The UN and several nations already have sanctions in place against North Korea, targeting its weapons programme and financial ability to function abroad. Meanwhile food aid to North Korea - which relies on donations to feed its people - has fallen in recent years as tensions have risen. But these measures do not seem to be slowing down North Korea's ability to move forward on the military front. China is widely seen as the nation most able to impose economic pain on North Korea. Experts say targeting the intermediaries that keep North Korea moving - like Chinese banks - would make a real impact, as would targeting the oil that Pyongyang imports from China. This is some movement on this. A Reuters report in late June, citing unidentified sources, said China's state oil giant had suspended sales to Pyongyang, though it suggested the decision was commercial. The US, meanwhile, has imposed sanctions on a Chinese bank accused of laundering North Korean money. But the key problem is that China does not want to take actions that would destabilise the government in North Korea and potentially unleash chaos on its border. So, John Nilsson-Wright says, China has been trying to play the role of honest broker, lobbying the US to talk to Pyongyang. But the US, Japan and South Korea have made it very clear that the North must show a real willingness to compromise before talks become an option. Is there a military option? Not a good one. It is generally thought that military action against North Korea would lead to very high military and civilian casualties. Finding and eliminating North Korea's nuclear stockpile would be hard - experts suspect assets are buried deep underground. Moreover the North is heavily armed, with an arsenal of missiles putting Seoul (and beyond) in range, chemical and biological weapons, and about one million troops. "The risk is that it provokes a counterattack that is massively costly to South Korea," says Dr Nilsson-Wright. What about assassination? In the past South Korea has talked overtly about a "decapitation" strategy - a targeted attack to remove Kim Jong-un and his leadership. This could be a tactic to deter North Korea from further provocations or to force it back to the negotiating table, says Dr Nilsson-Wright. The strong view in Seoul, he says, is that the only way to get the North back to the negotiating table is to make the government feel so insecure that it feels it has no choice. There are also big questions around who might fill the vacuum if a "decapitation" went ahead. The elite have a vested interest in the survival of the Kim government and there is no political opposition. How about a gradual opening? For a while some thought that the way to bring North Korea into the international community was to help it open up gradually, through small economic reforms, using the model of China's transformation after the death of Mao Zedong There were signs Kim Jong-il - the leader's late father - may have been interested in this approach, as he made several trips to Chinese industrial zones. The key supporter of this, however, was thought to be Chang Song-thaek, the leader's uncle. But Kim Jong-un had him executed in December 2013, calling him a traitor who planned to overthrow the state. Kim Jong-un has not yet visited China - in fact, he has not visited any foreign country since becoming leader in 2011. And while he has talked of economic growth, the military programme appears to be his priority. Could a credible opposition emerge? This is very unlikely. One-party rule is absolute in North Korea. Citizens are encouraged to worship the Kim dynasty, which is portrayed as the only institution keeping them safe from external aggression. There are no independent media. All TV, radio and newspapers are state-controlled and North Korea has created its own internet so citizens have no electronic access to the outside world. There is a limited flow of information across the Chinese border, including DVDs which are smuggled in. But in general North Korea exercises very tight control over its citizens. The government has informants everywhere looking for signs of dissent and penalties are severe. Offenders (and sometimes their whole families) can be sent to labour camps where many die. So what's the best option? There needs to be a mixture of pressure and dialogue, says Dr Nilsson-Wright. Pressure, he suggests, could involve some combination of enhanced sanctions, the relisting of North Korea as a State Sponsor of Terrorism (it was removed from the list in 2008), and close work with China to inflict real pain. Possible incentives could include formal diplomatic recognition by the US or a peace treaty (the two Koreas remain technically at war). Key to this approach would be co-ordination between the US, China, South Korea and Japan. But there are problems. After initial apparent warmth, ties between the Trump administration and Beijing seem to be cooling. In June US President Donald Trump tweeted that China's approach to North Korea had "not worked out". Ties between Japan, South Korea and China remain fractious over historical issues. Beijing is also fiercely opposed to the deployment by the US of a Thaad missile defence system in South Korea. In Seoul, new liberal President Moon Jae-in must walk a fine line balancing the interests of his electorate, biggest military ally and powerful neighbour. So there are divisions to exploit. "That is why North Korea is pushing it now - it knows it has a window on which to capitalise," Dr Nilsson-Wright argues.
The Chinese government has already evacuated more than 3,000 people, Chinese state-run media report. The first ship set sail on Sunday, while 16 critically injured Chinese nationals left Vietnam on a chartered flight, Xinhua news agency said. Two Chinese workers have been killed and dozens more injured in unrest over a Chinese oil rig in disputed waters. On Saturday the Vietnamese government called for an end to the protests. Officials said "illegal acts" would be stopped as they could damage national stability. However, dissident groups have urged people to rally again in major cities on Sunday and the authorities broke up some anti-China protests in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. In recent days crowds have set fire to at least 15 foreign-owned factories - including Chinese, Taiwanese and South Korean businesses - in several Vietnamese industrial parks. 'Dissatisfied' Correspondents say the attacks appear to have worried authorities, as Hanoi depends heavily on foreign investment for economic growth. However, China has urged authorities to take tougher measures to punish rioters. "We are strongly dissatisfied by the Vietnamese side failure to respond effectively to curb an escalation," Xinhua quoted security chief Guo Shengkun as saying on Saturday. The protests have been triggered by China's decision to move its Haiyang Shiyou 981 oil rig into contested waters in the South China Sea. This led to confrontations between Vietnamese and Chinese ships earlier this month, as Vietnam sought to block the move. China insists it will continue drilling in the area, west of the Paracel Islands - which are controlled by China but also claimed by Vietnam, and Taiwan. Nationalist sentiment is currently running very high in Vietnam over the issue, correspondents say. Many of those evacuated are workers employed at Chinese-owned factories or construction projects in Vietnam, says the BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Beijing.
Marcleudo de Melo Ferreira, 22, died in hospital in Manaus after falling nearly 35m (115ft). Hours later, another worker died of a heart attack at a nearby site. His family said he was overworked. The builders' union is discussing whether to strike over working conditions. Several construction workers have now died at venues connected with the World Cup as Brazil rushes to complete its stadiums on schedule. Two were killed in an accident on 27 November when a crane fell and destroyed parts of Sao Paulo's Arena Corinthians, which will host the opening game on 12 June. That accident delayed the stadium's completion date by several months. It is now expected to be ready in mid-April. 'Sunday to Sunday' Andrade Gutierrez, the company building the Manaus stadium, said Mr Ferreira had been employed by a company subcontracted to construct the stadium's cover. It said work had been halted until Sunday. But the death of a second worker, at a convention centre building site, led to new calls by the union to begin a strike from Monday. The body of Jose Antonio da Silva Nascimento, 49, was found late on Saturday morning at the new building, which will host meetings during the World Cup. His death may not be connected with the working conditions, but relatives said he was under pressure because the work was behind schedule. "He worked from Sunday to Sunday," sister-in-law Priscila Soares told O Globo newspaper. The stadium in the Amazonian jungle city is where the England team will open their 2014 World Cup campaign, playing against Italy. Brazil has admitted it is struggling to have all 12 venues completed on time. Six venues are ready; the other six have missed this month's deadline set by Fifa - the world's football governing body. The country's preparations for the World Cup have also been hit by cost overruns and public protests over what is seen as wasted resources. Last week Fifa's General Secretary Jerome Valcke appealed to Brazilians to support the contest saying it was the "wrong time" to protest.
By Chris JohnstonBusiness reporter The agreement was signed during a visit by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to France. The order included 73 wide body and 45 narrow body jets, including 12 A380 superjumbos. Iran's decision to buy the A380 is a significant boost for Airbus. The company has struggled to convince airlines to order the world's biggest passenger aircraft in the past two years. Airbus only broke even on the A380 programme last year, a decade after it first took to the air. The huge deal will depend on Airbus winning US export licences because more than 10% of the parts for the planes are made in the United States. It also covers the training of pilots, airport operations and air traffic management support, the company said. The UK stands to benefit from the order as wings for Airbus planes such as the A320 are made in Broughton, north Wales. Iran is also interested in buying planes from Boeing, Airbus's arch rival. Transport Minister Abbas Akhoundi has estimated that his country will need 400 medium- and long-range planes, and 100 short-haul jets, in the next few years. An embargo imposed in 1995 has prevented Western manufacturers from selling equipment and spare parts to Iranian companies. Iranian airlines have about 140 planes that are an average of 20 years old, with many needing to be retired. Direct flights Flag carrier Iran Air has three weekly flights to London and two to Paris and Amsterdam respectively. It is also considering resuming direct flights to the US, which ended more than 30 years ago. About one million Iranians live in the US, with the thousands who fly home every year forced to change in London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Istanbul or Dubai. Iran Air chief executive Farhad Parvaresh said: "Today's announcement is a first step towards restoring the prestige of the civil aviation sector in the region, and alongside partners such as Airbus we will offer unparalleled services." Several European airlines, including Air France-KLM, plan to resume flights to Iran this year. Many European companies are lining up to strike deals with Iran following the lifting of sanctions.
The male caretakers and maintenance staff allege they are being sexually discriminated against. Eight other men have had their cases stayed pending the outcome of the current tribunal in Cardiff. The workers are seeking more than £700,000 in wages they say they should have been paid over a six-year period. An employment tribunal will determine whether the men were discriminated against. All were originally employed by Swansea Metropolitan University, which merged with the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in August last year. The men's claims focus on changes to contracts which saw standard 37-hour working weeks introduced. Previously, the men had been on a 45-hour week. The hearing was told that university officials agreed to continue offering the men an extra eight hours of overtime a week. But when the new contracts were brought in, the workmen said they found they were on a lower hourly rate of pay than women workers on the same grade. Representing the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, Peter Wallington QC told the tribunal that this was a "complex case" and he will argue the university has a defence under the Equality Act. The hearing continues.
By Prof Rana MitterUniversity of Oxford The country is perhaps more aware of its own history than any other major society on earth. That remembering is certainly partial - events like Mao's Cultural Revolution are still very difficult to discuss within China itself. But it is striking how many echoes of the past can be found in its present. Trade China remembers a time when it was forced to trade against its will. Today it regards Western efforts to open its markets as a reminder of that unhappy period. The US and China are currently in a dispute over whether China is selling into the US while closing its own markets to American goods. Yet the balance of trade hasn't always been in China's favour. In Beijing, there are long memories of a period, nearly a century and a half ago, when China had little control over its own trade. Britain attacked China in a series of Opium Wars, starting in 1839. In the decades that followed, Britain founded an institution called the Imperial Maritime Customs Service to fix tariffs on goods imported into China. It was part of the Chinese government, but it was a very British institution, run not by a mandarin from Beijing, but a man from Portadown. Sir Robert Hart ended up becoming inspector-general of the Customs of China, which became a fiefdom for Brits for a century afterwards. Hart was honest and helped to generate a great deal of income for China. But the memories of that time still rankle. It was very different in the Ming dynasty, in the early 15th Century, when Admiral Zheng took seven great fleets to South East Asia, Ceylon and even the coast of East Africa to trade and show off China's might. Zheng He's voyages were partly about making an impression. Few other empires could boast the massive fleets that it sent out across the oceans, and it was also an opportunity for strange and wonderful items be brought back to Beijing - such as China's first giraffe. However, trade was also important, particularly in other parts of Asia. And Zhen could, and did, fight when he wanted to, defeating at least one ruler of Ceylon. Yet his voyages were a rare example of a state-driven maritime project. Most of China's overseas trade for the next few centuries would be unofficial. Trouble with the neighbours China has always been concerned to keep states on its borders pacified. That's part of the reason it deals so warily with an unpredictable North Korea today. This is not the first time that China has had problems with those on its borders. In fact, history reveals it has had worse neighbours than North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who recently made a surprise visit to Beijing, his first known foreign trip since taking office in 2011. During the Song dynasty in 1127, a woman named Li Qingzhao fled her home in the city of Kaifeng. We know her story because she was one of China's finest poets, and her works are still widely read. She went on the run because her state was under attack. A people from the north, the Jurchen, had burst into China after a long period of uneasy alliance with the ruling Song dynasty's emperor. The elite of China's civilisation had to spread themselves across the country as cities burned. Li Qingzhao saw her beloved art collection scattered between various cities. Her dynasty's fate was an object lesson that appeasing the neighbours may work for only so long. For some time, the Jin dynasty ruled Northern China, and the Song founded a new realm in the south. But in the end, both fell to a new conqueror, the Mongols. The shifting lines on the map show that the definition of China has changed over time. Chinese culture is associated with certain ideas such as language, history and ethical systems like Confucianism. However, other peoples, including Manchus and Mongols from the north, have taken China's throne at various points, ruling the country using the same ideas and principles upon which their ethnic Chinese counterparts relied. These neighbours did not always stay put. But sometimes they embraced and exercised Chinese values just as effectively as the people from whom they took them. Information flow Today China's internet censors politically sensitive material, and those who utter political truths deemed problematic by the authorities may be arrested or worse. The difficulty of speaking truth to power has long been an issue. China's historians have often felt they had to write what the state wanted rather than what they thought was important. But Sima Qian - often dubbed China's "grand historian" - chose a different path. The author of one of the most important works chronicling China's past, in the 1st Century BC, he dared to defend a general who had lost a battle. In doing so he was held to have snubbed the emperor, and was sentenced to castration. Yet he left behind a legacy which has shaped the writing of history in China to this day. Find out more: His Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) mixed different types of sources, critiqued figures from the historical past, and also used the techniques of oral history to find out directly from participants what had actually happened. All of this was a very new way of doing history, but it set a precedent for later writers: if you were willing to risk your safety, you could write history "warts and all", rather than censoring yourself. Freedom of religion Modern China is much more tolerant of religious practice than in the days of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution - within limits - but past experience makes it cautious about faith-driven movements which could potentially spiral out of control and pose a challenge to the government. Records show that openness to religion has long been part of Chinese history. At the height of the Tang dynasty in the 7th Century, the Empress Wu Zetian embraced Buddhism as a way of pushing back against what she must have regarded as the stifling norms of China's Confucian traditions. In the Ming dynasty, the Jesuit Matteo Ricci arrived at court and was treated as a respected interlocutor, although there was perhaps more interest in his knowledge of Western science than his slightly wan attempts to convert his listeners. But faith has always been a dangerous business. In the late 19th Century, China was convulsed by a rebellion started by Hong Xiuquan, a man who claimed to be Jesus's younger brother. The Taiping rebellion promised to bring a kingdom of heavenly peace to China but actually led to one of the bloodiest civil wars in history, killing as many as 20 million people, according to some accounts. Government troops initially failed to tame the rebels, and had to allow local soldiers to reform themselves before they eventually put down the Taiping with great cruelty in 1864. Christianity would be at the centre of another uprising some decades later. In 1900, peasant rebels calling themselves Boxers would appear in north China, calling for death to Christian missionaries and converts, the latter being characterised as traitors to China. At first, the Imperial Court backed them, which led to the death of many Chinese Christians, before the uprising was eventually put down. Through much of the following century, and to the present day, the Chinese state has veered between tolerance of religion, and the fear that it may upend the state. Technology Today China seeks to become a world hub for new technology. A century ago it went through an earlier industrial revolution - and women were central to both. China is a world leader when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI), voice recognition, and big data. A large number of the smartphones around the world are built with Chinese-made chips. Many of the factories which manufacture them are staffed by young women who often endure horrific conditions of work, but who are also finding a place in the industrial market economy for the first time. They have inherited the experience of the young women who came 100 years ago to the factories that sprang up in Shanghai and the Yangtze delta. They were not making computer chips, but silk and cotton threads. Work was hard and likely to cause lung disease or physical injury, and conditions in the workers' dormitories were spartan. Yet the women also recalled the pleasure of having their own wages, however, small, and the ability to visit a fair or theatre on a rare holiday. Some made the journey to look - probably not buy - at the shiny new department stores in central Shanghai, one of the ultimate symbols of modernity. Today, on Nanjing Road in that city, you can still see China's new working and middle class enjoying a wide range of consumer goods as part of China's contemporary tech-driven economy. The view from future historians? We are living through another significantly transformative era for China. Future historians will note that a country that was poor and inward-looking in 1978 became - within a quarter of a century - the second biggest economy in the world. They will also note that China was the most important country to push back against what had seemed like an inevitable tide of democratisation. Perhaps other factors such as the one-child policy (now ended) and the use of AI surveillance may catch future writers' attention. Or maybe it will be something else to do with the environment, space exploration or economic growth, which is not yet even obvious to us. One thing is almost certain - a century from now, China will still be a place of fascination for those who live there and those who live with it, and its rich history will continue to inform its present and future direction.

Philip Hammond told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that, if fundamental change did not happen, the British people would vote to leave. On Tuesday David Cameron will write to the European Council president, setting out the changes he wants for the UK. The Vote Leave campaign said his demands were a "dishonest gimmick". Mr Hammond said Mr Cameron's letter to European Council President Donald Tusk would would set out Britain's argument for reform but it would not include "detailed specific legislative changes". "We don't want to be excessively prescriptive at the beginning of the discussion. This letter is not the end of the process, it is the beginning of the process," he told BBC1's The Andrew Marr Show. But he warned the British public would not be "fobbed off with a set of cosmetic alterations to the way the EU works". And there would have to be "substantive legally-binding change" if the British public were to vote for it in the referendum, adding: "This is about fundamental change in the direction of travel of the European Union." Read more on this story What Britain wants from Europe EU vote: When, what and why? Who are the exit groups? Asked if the UK could comfortably exist outside the EU, Mr Hammond said the country would face "big challenges". "If we were not in the EU we would have to find a different way of promoting our economy. It is not impossible but it would be challenging," he said. The Conservatives have promised an in-out referendum on the EU by 2017. 'Panicking' Dominic Cummings, director of the Vote Leave campaign, said: "We expect Cameron to get what he's asking for but what he's asking for is trivial. "The public wants the end of the supremacy of EU law and to take back control of our economy, our borders, and our democracy. The only way to do this is to vote leave. "No 10 is panicking because people can see the renegotiation is a dishonest gimmick." UKIP MEP Dianne James told the Andrew Marr programme: "We know the prime minister wants to stay in - he has made no secret of of it." But the SNP said David Cameron was "playing a dangerous game by recklessly flirting with the prospect of leaving the European Union in a desperate attempt to keep his Tory backbenchers on side". Mr Hammond told Andrew Marr the letter to Donald Tusk would not go further than what ministers have already said in speeches and articles - but they would be set out in one place for the first time. They are likely to include: In a speech on Tuesday, Mr Cameron will say: "If we can't reach such an agreement [on reforms], and if Britain's concerns were to be met with a deaf ear, which I do not believe will happen, then we will have to think again about whether this European Union is right for us. "As I have said before - I rule nothing out," David Cameron will say. Mr Cameron will say he is ready to campaign to stay in the EU "with all my heart and all my soul", but only if the terms are right. 'Economic risks' He will insist he has "every confidence" that it is possible for the negotiations to deliver an agreement which works for both the UK and the EU's 28 other nations. "Those who believe we should stay in the EU at all costs need to explain why Britain should accept the status quo. I am clear that there are real problems with this," he will add. But he will also say there are some "economic risks" to staying in the union and he will cite examples such as EU regulations which "hold back our ability to trade and create jobs". "And there are also significant risks if we allow our sovereignty to be eroded by ever-closer union, or sit by and do nothing about the unsustainable rate of migration into our country," he will say.
By Tim HarfordBBC World Service, 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy My left-hand little finger holds the shift key, then the other fingers of my left hand clumsily crab sideways across the upper row. Q-W-E-R-T-Y. There's a lesson here: it matters where the keys sit on your keyboard. There are good arrangements and bad ones. Many people think that qwerty is a bad one - in fact, that it was deliberately designed to be slow and awkward. Could that be true? And why do economists, of all people, argue about this? It turns out that the stakes are higher than they might first appear.

But let's start by figuring out why anyone might have been perverse enough to want to slow down typists. In the early 1980s, I persuaded my mother Deb to let me use her mechanical typewriter, a miraculous contraption which would transcend my awful handwriting. When I hit a key, a lever would flick up from behind the keyboard and whack hard against an inked ribbon, squeezing that ink against a sheet of paper. On the end of the lever - called a type bar - would be a pair of reversed letters in relief. I discovered that if I hit several keys at once, the type bars all flew up at the same time into the same spot. Fun for a nine-year-old boy, less so for a professional typist. Typing at 60 words per minute (wpm) - no stretch for a good typist - means five or six letters striking the same spot each second. At such a speed, the typist might need to be slowed down for the sake of the typewriter. That is what qwerty supposedly did. Then again, if qwerty really was designed to be slow, how come the most popular pair of letters in English, T-H, are adjacent and right under the index fingers? The plot thickens. The father of the qwerty keyboard was Christopher Latham Sholes, a printer from Wisconsin who sold his first typewriter in 1868 to Porter's Telegraph College, Chicago. That bit's important. The qwerty layout was designed for the convenience of telegraph operators transcribing Morse code - that's why, for example, the Z is next to the S and the E, because Z and SE are indistinguishable in American Morse code. The telegraph receiver would hover over those letters, waiting for context to make everything clear. So the qwerty keyboard wasn't designed to be slow. But it wasn't designed for the convenience of you and me, either. So why do we still use it? The simple answer is that qwerty won a battle for dominance in the 1880s. Sholes' design was taken up by the gunsmiths E Remington and Sons. They finalised the layout and put it on the market for $125 - perhaps $3,000 (£2,271) in today's money, many months' income for the secretaries who would have used it. It wasn't the only typewriter around - Sholes has been described as the "52nd man to invent the typewriter" - but the qwerty keyboard emerged victorious. The Remington company cannily provided qwerty typing courses, and when it merged with four major rivals in 1893, they all adopted what became known as "the universal layout". And this brief struggle for market dominance in 1880s America determines the keyboard layout on today's iPads. Nobody then was thinking about our interests - but their actions control ours. And that's a shame, because more logical layouts exist: notably the Dvorak, designed by August Dvorak and patented in 1932. It favours the dominant hand (left and right-hand layouts are available) and puts the most-used keys together. The US Navy conducted a study in the 1940s demonstrating that the Dvorak was vastly superior: training typists to use the Dvorak layout would pay for itself many times over. So why didn't we all switch to Dvorak? The problem lay in co-ordinating the switch. Qwerty had been the universal layout since before Dvorak was born. Most typists trained on it. Any employer investing in a costly typewriter would naturally choose the layout that most typists could use, especially when economies of scale made it the cheapest model on the market. Dvorak keyboards never stood a chance. So now we start to see why this case matters. Many economists argue qwerty is the quintessential example of something they call "lock in". This isn't really about typewriters. It's about Microsoft Office and Windows, Amazon's control of the online retail link between online buyers and sellers, and Facebook's dominance of social media. More things that made the modern economy: How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff What leaded petrol says about the limits of regulation? How the plough changed everything How Ikea's Billy bookcase took over the world If all your friends are on Facebook apps such as Instagram and WhatsApp, doesn't that lock you in as surely as a qwerty typist? This matters. The lock-in is the friend of monopolists, the enemy of competition, and may require a robust response from regulators. But maybe dominant standards are dominant not because of lock-in, but just because the alternatives simply aren't as compelling as we imagine. Consider the famous Navy study that demonstrated the superiority of the Dvorak keyboard. Two economists, Stan Liebowitz and Stephen Margolis, unearthed that study, and concluded it was badly flawed. They also raised an eyebrow at the name of the man who supervised it - the Navy's leading time-and-motion expert, one Lieutenant-Commander… August Dvorak. Liebowitz and Margolis don't deny that the Dvorak design may be better: the world's fastest alphanumeric typists do use Dvorak's layout. In 2008, Barbara Bradford was recorded maintaining a speed of 150 words per minute (wpm) for 50 minutes, and reached a top speed of 212 wpm using such a keyboard. But they were just not convinced that this was ever an example where an entire society was desperate to switch to a hugely superior standard yet unable to co-ordinate. And in fact these days, most of us peck away at our own emails, on devices which can actually let you switch your keyboard layout. Windows, iOS and Android all offer Dvorak layouts. You no longer need to persuade your co-workers, other employers and secretarial schools to switch with you. If you want it, you can just use it. Nobody else is even going to notice. Yet most of us stick with qwerty. The door is no longer locked, but we can't be bothered to escape. Lock-in seems to be entrenching the position of some of the most powerful and valuable companies in the world today - including Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. Maybe those locks are as unbreakable as the qwerty standard once seemed. Or maybe they risk being crow-barred off if restless consumers are tempted by something better. After all, it wasn't that long ago that people worried about users being locked in to MySpace.

The comments came in the Bank's latest quarterly inflation report, which raised the forecast for UK economic growth this year and next. On Wednesday, the UK unemployment rate was reported at 7.6%, down from 7.8%. Chancellor George Osborne said the report was proof the government's economic plan was working. Mr Carney has said the Bank will not consider raising interest rates until the jobless rate falls to 7% or below. The timing of a rise in interest rates could have a significant political impact, but Mr Carney says that will not affect his decision making. In an interview with Channel 4 News he said he would raise interest rates just before the 2015 general election "if I had to". Chances The Bank has given a range of forecasts of when it thinks unemployment could fall to 7%. The most optimistic of these is next year, two years ahead of the time frame it gave in August. The odds for this are low, though. The Bank said: "The MPC [Monetary Policy Committee] attaches only a two-in-five chance to the... unemployment rate having reached the 7% threshold by the end of 2014. "The corresponding figures for the end of 2015 and 2016 are around three in five and two in three respectively." The Bank said on Wednesday that it was not planning to raise interest rates any time soon from their current record low of 0.5%. Even when - and if - the jobless rate reaches 7% the Bank will not automatically move to change the cost of borrowing. Growth outlook Growth for this year is forecast to be 1.6%, up from 1.4% previously thought, and for next year, annual growth is expected to be 2.8%, rather than the 2.5% it predicted in August. The report said: "In the United Kingdom, recovery has finally taken hold. The economy is growing robustly as lifting uncertainty and thawing credit conditions start to unlock pent-up demand." Mr Osborne said: "Our economic plan is working and as the governor of the Bank of England says, the recovery is taking hold." Mr Osborne added that many risks remained but he said the greatest risk would be if his plan was abandoned and quick fixes and more borrowing made a return. The chief policy director of the business lobby group, the CBI, Katja Hall, said: "The Bank's forecast confirms businesses' view that the UK economic recovery is on track. "But there are still hurdles to overcome before growth gets back to a sustainable level, including boosting business investment and trade. " Housing Interest rate decisions are traditionally used to control inflation. There is no obvious pressure for an interest rate rise on that basis, as this week, official figures said inflation had fallen from 2.7% to 2.2% in October. However, house price inflation is at worryingly high levels in certain parts of the country. Mr Carney said this was largely affecting more expensive properties: "In terms of housing valuation, there are clearly areas in the country where valuation is very elevated. "What we are seeing across the UK is the greatest price momentum is for houses that are towards the upper end of the valuation spectrum." One of the Bank's regulatory bodies, the Financial Policy Committee, is charged with looking out for signs of an overheating property market. Mr Carney said it was on the look-out for any bubbles, but that there did not seem to be any looming: "The Financial Policy Committee will be vigilant about potential risks there, but we need to put the pick-up in housing activity in perspective. "Activity levels, while they've picked up, are still running at between two-thirds or three-quarters of historic averages in terms of whether it's transactions or approvals, homebuilding, so there is some room for that to further pick up."
It stands at 23.3 per 1,000 women aged 15 to 17, which experts say is more in line with the rest of Western Europe. There were 5,740 pregnancies in girls aged under 18 in the three months to June 2014, data from the Office for National Statistics shows. This compares with 6,279 in the same period in 2013 and 7,083 for the June quarter the year before that. Historically, the UK has had one of the highest teenage pregnancy and abortion rates in Western Europe. In recent years, the government put a series of strategies in place in an attempt to get these figures down. There are no comparable rates for conceptions across Europe, but the under-18 birth rate suggests England is closing the gap. The under-18 birth rate in 2012 in England and Wales was 9.2, compared with an EU average of 6.9. However, the UK birth rate has fallen by almost a third (32.3%) since 2004 compared with a fall of 15.6% in the EU. In 2004, the UK rate was 13.6 births per 1,000 women aged 15-17 compared with an EU average rate of 7.7. A spokeswoman for the British Pregnancy Advisory Service said: "Contrary to popular perception, this data shows that the teenage pregnancy rate is falling dramatically in England and Wales. While the UK has historically had a high teenage conception rate, it is now at its lowest level on record and not significantly out of step with other European countries. "We have seen a huge decline in the number of babies born to teenage mothers over the last decade, in part due to the improvements we've seen in contraception advice and services for younger women, with straightforward access to abortion services when their chosen method lets them down. But it also reflects broader societal shifts, with younger women quite rightly expecting and able to pursue educational and professional ambitions."
The red brick terrace at 9 Newcastle Road, Wavertree, was where the member of The Beatles lived from birth, in 1940, until he was five. Auctioneers said a telephone bidder, who wanted to remain anonymous, was the successful buyer after a "bidding war". The three-bedroom house had been given a guide price of between £150,000 and £250,000. The property has a rear yard and is a few streets away from Penny Lane, made famous by The Beatles. Andrew Brown, from Countrywide Property Auctions, said: "There was a lot of interest in the property before the auction from potential buyers who lived in the UK and internationally."
A University of Bristol-led study found 80% failed to meet the government target of taking moderate exercise at least 12 times in a four-week period. Better-off and better-educated adults were most likely to exercise, while the poorer and least educated were most likely to be inactive. The study analysed exercise data for more than a million adults in England. It found about 8% of adults who were physically able to walk had not walked for even five minutes continuously during a four-week period, while 46% had not walked for leisure for more than 30 minutes continuously. Researchers said 88% had not been swimming, 90% had not used a gym and around 20% of people over the age of 16 had done only minimal amounts of physical activity. Warm weather They say the findings provide evidence of a direct correlation between an individual's education, household income and local area deprivation and their level of physical activity. Those with higher socioeconomic status were more physically active and people with a degree only had a 12% chance of being inactive. However, those with no qualifications were three times as likely to not exercise. Those living in areas with more sports facilities and higher local authority spending on new facilities were also less likely to be inactive. The study also found warm weather made people more likely to exercise, while rain reduced levels of physical activity. Carol Propper, professor of economics at the university's Centre for Market and Public Organisation, said: "Physical inactivity is the most important modifiable health behaviour for chronic disease, so knowing who is physically inactive is important for designing cost-effective policy interventions." She said the findings suggested that "financial as well as cultural barriers need to be overcome to reduce the prevalence of physical inactivity". The NHS recommends people exercise at moderate intensity for at least two and a half hours every week. This can include cycling, fast walking, hiking and basketball. Experts also recommend muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days a week to work major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders and arms). Olympic legacy Tam Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum and honorary chairman of the Child Growth Foundation, said: "No-one should be at all surprised by these woeful statistics." He blamed successive governments for failing to ensure that the London 2012 Olympics inspired people to participate in grassroots sport. The Economic and Social Research Council-funded research analysed data from Sport England's annual Active People Surveys, which included details on an individual's gender, education, income and local area deprivation, physical activity levels and local geographical factors such as weather and access to sports facilities and green spaces. The World Health Organisation estimates physical inactivity causes 1.9 million deaths a year worldwide, including 10% to 16% of breast cancer, colon cases and diabetes cases and about 22% of coronary heart disease cases.
While watching explicit content in store was always banned, the coffee giant will now actively block such content. The company has been under pressure from a Virginia-based non-profit, Enough is Enough, to filter pornography in its stores. McDonald's changed its wi-fi policies in 2016 after pressure from the group. "While it rarely occurs, the use of Starbucks public Wi-Fi to view illegal or egregious content is not, nor has it ever been permitted," Starbucks said in a statement reported by BuzzFeed News. The coffee company said it had "identified a solution" to stop access to pornography in all in US locations by 2019, but did not specify what this solution was. People reacted with confusion and humour on social media after the company made its announcement. Enough is Enough issued a statement earlier in the week condemning the company for breaking a promise to block such content in 2016. "Starbucks continues to serve up free, unrestricted WiFi to its customers, opening the door for patrons to view graphic or obscene pornography, view or distribute child pornography (an illegal crime) or engage in sexual predation activity," the statement read. The group encouraged people to sign a petition demanding Starbucks introduce such a filter. Almost 27,000 people had signed it by Thursday. In response, entertainment news site TMZ reports that pornography website YouPorn has banned Starbucks coffee from its offices. A letter on the TMZ website, allegedly from YouPorn vice-president Charles Hughes, says the new policy will come into effect on 1 January 2019. You may also be interested in:
By Angie BrownBBC Scotland, Edinburgh and East reporter The Edinburgh Fringe attracts so many visitors that the Royal Mile - where street performers mix with actors promoting their shows congregate - becomes a sea of people. But what is it like on the street after the cancellation of the festival and the city's other major cultural festivals? In a normal year, the Fringe attracts so many street performers that City of Edinburgh Council has to give them time slots. But this year James Hessler had no difficulty getting himself a place on the Royal Mile. James, 58, from Midlothian, has performed on the street during 20 Edinburgh Fringes. He said: "I wanted to come back as quickly as possible so I called the council and was given a licence. "Normally you just have to make a loud noise and you have a huge audience during the festival but this year there is a much slower build up to attract people and so you have to have more material. "Now we are having to build an audience but then pull it when we see it is getting too big, we do this by making the shows shorter. "It's great to be back out on the Royal Mile and we just have to work harder to get more energy from a smaller audience." Todd Various, 45, from Midlothian, who has performed street theatre during 16 Edinburgh Festivals, said he estimated there was about 20% of the normal footfall of the Fringe. He said: "This crowd is way better because it is a genuine audience making the choice to watch me. "Normally people are muscled into watching what is closest to them." David Bosek, 41, from Edinburgh, said his street performance with his puppet Evan had been a hit this year. He said: "Less people is better for my show because I can interact with people more easily and make more jokes. "Busier makes me more money but I prefer more funny and less money. "I've been joking all day with people this year, which I love. "However, I do want the festival to run next year in all its full glory." Glynis Hammond, 36, from Watford in Hertfordshire, said she was "shocked and happy" at how many people there were on the Royal Mile. She said: "I expected it to be so quiet, so to see so many tourists, so many people here, is just great." Glynis said they should have been on holiday in Ghana, but had come to Edinburgh instead. She and her daughter Nia had visited the castle and had caricatures done by a street artist in the Royal Mile. "It is our first time in Scotland and it makes me want to come back," she said. "I'm thinking of talking my husband into the Scottish Highlands for Christmas now that I've seen how great it is here. Rafkha Gibrani, 20, from Brighton, was making his first trip to Edinburgh. He said: "I was due to be in Mauritius but it was cancelled so I have come to Edinburgh instead and I am staying with friends. "I wasn't expecting it to be this busy but I am happy to see more people because it means things are getting back to normal. "I am enjoying my trip so much and will definitely come back when the Edinburgh Festival is on again." Shops, restaurants and bars in and around the Royal Mile said footfall had been nothing like the levels they would normally experience during the festivals in August. Naz Issa, manager of Laila's Bistro in Edinburgh's Cockburn Street, said his takings were down to a third of what he would have expected at this time of year. He said: "It's been nowhere near as busy, not even half as busy. "It's certainly not a ghost town now, but normally it's chock-a-block on the Royal Mile with 50,000 people and now there are just a few thousand. "During the festival it is very difficult to walk down the Royal Mile. There is still life here now but it's not the same buzz. "I'm looking forward to next year when the festival returns." Daniela Scott, who runs her father's Italian restaurant Gordon's Trattoria, said: "Normally it takes me 15 minutes to walk down the Royal Mile to our restaurant during the festival because it is absolutely rammed. "Now its like a winter's day. "The Royal Mile is breathing again but there is no buzz and it's not comparable just now to previous August days during the festival. "We need the festival back next year." Kitty Bruce-Gardyne, director of Scottish Textiles in the Tron Kirk on the Royal Mile, said: "It's much emptier now. The comparison is dire. In the festival there are hordes of people walking past the door. "I miss the festival. There is no buzz just now, it is sad. "The Royal Mile is a different Edinburgh just now, it's an Edinburgh for locals." .
The visit came as China said one of its highest-ranking military officials had also visited the region recently. Tensions have escalated in the South China Sea in recent years, with China steadily expanding its military presence in the region. This week the US and the Philippines agreed to conduct joint patrols there. China claims most of the sea as its own and has become increasingly assertive. Ash Carter arrived on board the USS John C Stennis on Friday and gave a statement alongside Philippine Defense Secretary Voltaire Gazmin. "What's new is not an American carrier in this region," he said. "What's new is the context of tension which exists, which we want to reduce." He said that the US wanted to work together with China and that the trip was meant to show support for allies, rather than provoke Beijing. The US has expanded its support for allies in the South Pacific in recent months, following China's military build-up - which includes the construction of islands with airstrips. China, which claims a wide swathe of the sea, has been reclaiming land around reefs. The US and other countries have called for the halt of such activities, accusing China of militarisation but Beijing has insisted that the construction is for civilian purposes. Last week, US military officials announced they would send $40m (£28m) in military assistance to the Philippines to increase intelligence-sharing, surveillance and naval patrols.

They have been charged with "conspiracy to conduct an act in preparation for a terrorist act", Federal Police said. The arrests are linked to a plot outlined in material seized last year as part of Operation Appleby. That operation, in September 2014, was sparked by intelligence reports that Islamist extremists were planning random killings in Australia. Then-Prime Minister Tony Abbott said at the time a senior Australian Islamic State militant had called for "demonstration killings", reportedly including a public beheading. Another three people, aged between 21 and 22, were also charged for the same offence on Thursday afternoon. All face potential life sentences if convicted. Phil Mercer, BBC News, Sydney: "Continue to thwart attacks" While its FA-18 fighters bomb so-called Islamic State targets many thousands of kilometres away, and its soldiers train Iraqi forces, Australia continues to confront the enemy within. More counter-terrorism raids in Sydney have yielded further arrests, and will make an uneasy nation even more anxious on the eve of the first anniversary of the deadly Sydney siege. Last month, a poll found that more than half of Australians thought a large-scale attack was likely, and one-quarter was convinced it was inevitable. The prime minister has promised a "calm, clinical and effective" response to the menace of home-grown extremism. "We cannot eliminate entirely the risk of terrorism any more than we can eliminate the risk of any serious crime," said Malcolm Turnbull in his first national security address. "But we can mitigate it. We will continue to thwart and frustrate many attacks before they occur." Timeline of recent Australia terror incidents At least 800 heavily armed officers arrested 16 people as part of Operation Appleby in September 2014, in what was Australia's biggest ever anti-terror operation. Police said the arrests on Thursday were not linked to a new plot, but to documents seized during those raids that talked about a plan to target government and police buildings. "As a result of putting all of that information together, working through those documents, putting physical and electronic surveillance together, we were able to build a case of conspiracy for five people involved in the preparation of these documents," said Deputy Commissioner of National Security Michael Phelan. Those arrested on Thursday are also known to those involved in the terror-linked shooting of Sydney police worker Curtis Cheng, police said. Mr Cheng, 58, was shot dead outside his police headquarters office as he left work last October. Police shot dead his attacker, 15-year-old Farhad Jabar, at the scene. New South Wales Police said the 15-year-old boy arrested on Thursday was charged based on activity when he was 14. They added that he had clearly been radicalised, although they did not yet know how it had happened. "It is disturbing that we continue to deal with teenaged children in this environment," said Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn. "To be putting a 15-year-old before the courts on very serious charges that carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment demonstrates the difficulties law enforcement face." Police said a total of 11 people had now been charged under Operation Appleby.
By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter The actress, who stars in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, also said female characters in films should not have to be portrayed as physically tough in order to be considered strong. "I think that, so often, when a story's told which says 'this is a strong woman', she has to beat the man, or she has to be like the man, or she has to somehow not need the man," Jolie told journalists at the film's launch. Referring to her own character in the film and Princess Aurora, played by Elle Fanning, Jolie said: "We both very much need and love and learn from the men. "And so I think that's also an important message for young girls, to find their own power, but to respect and learn from the men around them." She added: "We have strong women, but the character that is wrong in the film and has to be taken out is also a woman. We show very diverse types of women between our characters, but also we have extraordinary men in the film, and I really want to press that point." Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, the sequel to 2014's Maleficent, is released in the UK later this month and also stars Ed Skrein, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Michelle Pfeiffer. Fanning, who reprises her role of Princess Aurora in the film, echoed Jolie's comments and said her character's strength is not necessarily physical, unlike many princesses in children's films. "Aurora's strength is her kindness, and she stays very true to herself, which is something I wanted to keep in the film. She is soft and feminine and wants to be a wife and have babies, and that's a beautiful, strong thing that isn't portrayed a lot on screen. "A lot of the princesses are like 'we're gonna make her a strong princess! And make her tough, so we're gonna make her fight!' And it's like, is that what being a strong woman means? Like, we just have to have a sword and have armour on and go fight? Aurora can do that in a different way, in a pink dress, and it's beautiful that she keeps her softness and vulnerabilities." 'How to use that power' Many of the female leads in action or children's films focus on the character's physical strength. Wonder Woman, for example, or Merida in the Disney's 2012 film Brave. Indeed, one of Jolie's previous roles was playing action hero Lara Croft in Tomb Raider. Explaining the premise of the Maleficent sequel, Fanning said: "Five years have passed in her life, and she's now Queen of the Moors, and she has this new responsibility, and she's trying to figure out who she is as a ruler and how to use that power." The movie's plot sees Jolie's Maleficent conflicted over her maternal feelings towards Aurora, and facing competition from the neighbouring Queen Ingrith (played by Michelle Pfeiffer). Queen Ingrith causes a rift between Maleficent and Aurora, when her son Prince Phillip proposes to the princess. Ingrith intends to use the marriage to divide humans and fairies, and it falls to Maleficent to stop the impending war. Official reviews are still under embargo, but critics who attended early screenings of the film have been allowed to share their first impressions on Twitter. "Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is like Pirates of the Caribbean; there's lots of convolution and contrivance, but has star power," said Courtney Howard, who reviews films for Variety and Awards Circuit. "Angelina Jolie, Michelle Pfeiffer and Elle Fanning are a holy trinity with bumpy arcs." Scott Menzel, the editor of We Live Entertainment, described it as "a visually spectacular sequel that proves once again that Angelina Jolie was born to play the title character. [It's] a modern day fairytale where badass women take centre stage. The battle sequences are epic and the costumes are stunning." "Angelina Jolie and Michelle Pfeiffer having a sass-off in Maleficent: Mistress of Evil is every bit as good as you'd hope," said Digital Spy. "The movie needs more of it, but it's still a visually bold, fun and superior sequel." The film received its London premiere on Wednesday. Fanning said: "I definitely felt a real responsibility to do the second film, the first film was the first film I'd ever done of that scale, and so many young kids saw the film, and especially young girls would come up to me, and they'd look at me as the character. "So hearing that we'd be doing the sequel, I felt a responsibility to those girls for sure, and just to get to show Aurora as a young woman growing up. Obviously in the first film, I was 14 when I did that, and Aurora still has the qualities that she does of kindness, innocence and sweetness that she embodies, but it was so fun to come back. "The three of us [Fanning, Jolie and Pfeiffer], we were there in the beginning, our relationships have changed and grown, I'm 21 now, so I wasn't the kid on set anymore. I really felt accepted on set in a way. Especially with Michelle and Angelina, I felt like they included me as if I was one of their peers." Jolie says the films have come to reflect the life cycle of a woman - something that wasn't necessarily the intention when the first movie was conceived. "One of the interesting things is, without realising, we've hit the chapters of the growth of a woman," she said. "Her birth, her christening, to being a little girl, a teenage girl, to now being a wife. And so in a way the chapters are following a few things, but one of them is how a woman grows and evolves."

From Monday, any Australian arriving in the country from India faces fines and up to five years in prison. It comes after Canberra banned all flights from the virus hotspot until 15 May. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has dismissed accusations of racism. "The same accusations were made against the government over a year ago when we closed the borders to mainland China," he told Sydney radio station 2GB. "There's no politics or ideology in a pandemic... It's got nothing to do with politics, this is a virus." The policy marks the first time Australians have been criminalised for returning to their country, local media reported. There are an estimated 9,000 Australians in India, 600 of whom are classed as vulnerable. The government said the measures, which were announced on Saturday, are based on medical advice aimed at protecting the community. The virus is surging in India, with daily cases in the country topping 300,000 for 10 consecutive days. Officials said an increase in infection rates seen in Indian arrivals over the past fortnight has raised concerns. Australia has pursued a Covid elimination strategy - partly through strict border controls and mandatory quarantine - which has seen it record 910 deaths, far fewer than many other countries. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said India arrivals accounted for 57% of positive cases in quarantine, up from 10% in March. She said this placed a "very, very significant burden on health and medical services". However critics - among them medical experts and legal groups - argue the government's move to criminalise Indian arrivals was extreme and disproportionate to the health risks. Federal Greens Senator Mehreen Faruqi wrote on Twitter that the measures were "absolutely horrific and racist". Prominent conservative media commentator Andrew Bolt said the policy was "so mean and irrational that I must also blame racism". "I can't believe we would impose such a travel ban on white Australians fleeing, from, say England." Australia's former Race Discrimination Commissioner Tim Soutphommasane pointed out the "inconsistency" in the government's policy, noting bans and criminal penalties weren't imposed on Australians returning from other nations at the height of their Covid waves. "We didn't see differential treatment being extended to... the United States, the UK, and any European country even though the rates of infection were very high and the danger of arrivals from those countries was very high," he told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. "There are different standards at play here depending on which part of the world you're coming from." Members of the Indian-Australian community, which makes up about 2.6% of the population, have expressed anger over the sudden ban. Some have told the BBC they feel they are being treated like criminals and "second-class citizens" for wishing to flee danger. Legal experts have also raised concerns that the temporary ban violates international law. That includes the right for citizens to not be arbitrarily deprived entry to their country - recognised in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Australia is signatory. The Australian Human Rights Commission said in a statement: "The Government must show that these measures are not discriminatory and are the only suitable way of dealing with the threat to public health." Quarantine concerns The situation in India has also put renewed focus on Australia's quarantine system, which has seen more than a dozen infection leaks since November. The country has successfully operated a policy of mandatory, 14-day quarantine for all international arrivals - mostly conducted in hotels. But the government said the spike in positive cases from India now threatened to overwhelm its quarantine system, which has capacity to handle a maximum limit of 2% of arrivals being infected. The Australian Medical Association, the nation's peak medical group, said the need to pause Indian arrivals was an indication of the "frailty" of the quarantine system. "We would rather our governments focus on fixing the quarantine system and bring Australians home, rather than extend this ban any longer than it needs to be."
It sold 124,603 copies in its first three days, 10 times more than its closest rival, 1356 by Bernard Cornwell. Figures from Nielsen BookScan show it also sold 20 times the next new entry by Jackie Collins, The Power Trip. The Casual Vacancy is now the 15th best-selling book of the year so far. Set in a small town in the West Country where a local election divides the apparently cosy community, Rowling's new book has also divided critics. Their comments do not appear to have put readers off buying the book, which has already become this year's best-selling hardback fiction title, and the fastest selling since 2009's Dan Brown hardback The Lost Symbol, which topped 550,000 in its first week. However The Casual Vacancy has failed to touch sales of Rowling's seven Harry Potter titles. When her final instalment, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was published in 2007 it sold more than 2.6 million copies in its first week in the UK. That was two fifths of all the books sold in the UK that week. "By way of comparison, the latest phenomenon in the book trade, Fifty Shades of Grey, sold 664,000 in its highest week of sales so far," said David Walter from Nielsen BookScan, which has been monitoring book sales in the UK since 1998. He added: "JK Rowling's UK sales to date are of a value in excess of £238m, making her by far the highest selling author in the UK since our records began."
Mr Su was a vice-chairman of China's parliamentary advisory body. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) said he had used his position to obtain "large bribes". State media had announced in June 2014 that the government was investigating him for corruption. The CCDI statement (in Chinese) said that Mr Su had been expelled from the party and relieved of all positions. It added that his behaviour had "resulted in serious violations of the law" and that "the issue of his alleged crime, clues, and evidence have been handed to the legal authorities for them to take action". It said that Mr Su had abused his position of authority, receiving "large sums of illegal bribes" which resulted in "huge losses of government assets". The statement did not give figures. Mr Su, who was previously the top Communist Party official in Jiangxi province, was also found to be "chiefly responsible for the serious corruption problem that has emerged in Jiangxi". Chinese media reported in November last year that several officials from a city in Jiangxi said to have links to Mr Su were arrested. He was one of 23 vice-chairmen with the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which was seen as a prestigious position. The conference advises China's legislature, the National People's Congress. China has been conducting a widespread crackdown on corruption since President Xi Jinping took power in 2012, and has arrested dozens of officials and others in the private sector. The authorities have also gone after those who have fled the country, and extradited hundreds of suspected "economic criminals" back to China last year. Mr Su is considered to be among the most senior government figures caught in the dragnet, along with former security chief Zhou Yongkang who was arrested in December.

Please check your internet connection and tap 'show results' to try again! Life expectancy How much of your remaining life will be healthy? Life expectancy: You vs the world Life expectancy at birth, by country (years) The average global life expectancy from birth is 72 - that's 70 for men and 75 for women. However, this changes with age. For example, somebody aged 69 may expect to live another 17 years on average. If you cannot view the life expectancy calculator, click to launch the interactive content. Nine revealing facts about how long we live Why does life expectancy change based on your age? Life expectancy is the number of years on average a person is expected to live based on their age, gender and country. The Global Burden of Disease calculates life expectancy by using a country's mortality rates across age groups. Life expectancy may vary for people of different ages because it is calculated as the number of years a person is expected to live given they have already reached a certain age. For example, a girl born in 2016 in Mexico is expected to live to age 79, however the life expectancy of a 65-year-old woman in Mexico in 2016 is 84. Her life expectancy is higher because she has already reached 65 and is therefore more likely to live another 20 years.

The data behind the calculator is from the 2016 Global Burden of Disease Study. The values for life expectancy in the calculator are rounded to the nearest year after adding the age input to the remaining life expectancy for the relevant age group. In most cases age groups span five years, for example from ages 10 to 14. 'How much of your remaining life will be healthy' is calculated from the number of years a person can expect to live in good health, taking into account disability. This is displayed as a percentage of their remaining life expectancy. Results assume that rates of death and disability remain constant over the remainder of a person's life, so do not account for any expected scientific advances and improvements in medical treatments.

Andrés Manuel López Obrador said the indigenous peoples of Mexico had been the victims of massacres. Speaking in the ruins of an ancient city, he called for a full account of the abuses. Spain rejected his call and called for a "constructive perspective" instead. The territory which now makes up Mexico was under Spanish rule for some 300 years before gaining independence in the early 19th Century. At the time of the conquest, Spain was a fiercely Roman Catholic country and saw as its mission the spread of Christianity to regions such as the Americas. Why does Mexico want an apology now? The man who became Mexico's first leftist president in seven decades has been pursuing a radical agenda since being sworn in in December, promising to tackle corruption, reduce inequality and lift millions of Mexicans out of poverty. On Monday, he tweeted a video address from an archaeological site in Comacalco, Tabasco, where he is shown speaking alongside the First Lady, Beatriz Gutierrez. "I have sent a letter to the Spanish king [Felipe VI] and another letter to the Pope so that the abuses can be acknowledged and an apology can be made to the indigenous peoples for the violations of what we now call human rights," Mr López Obrador says. "There were massacres... The so-called conquest was done with the sword and the cross. They raised churches on top of temples." "The time has come to reconcile but first they should ask forgiveness," the president says. Mexico has the world's second biggest Roman Catholic population, after Brazil. Just over a fifth of Mexicans consider themselves to be indigenous but studies suggest many more have some pre-Hispanic ancestry. When Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez visited Mexico in January he presented President López Obrador with his grandfather José Obrador's Spanish birth certificate, from 1893, AFP news agency reports. What was the response? The Mexican leader's relations with Spain's centre-left ruling party have been friendly but the government in Madrid promptly rejected his request for an apology. "The arrival, 500 years ago, of Spaniards to present Mexican territory cannot be judged in the light of contemporary considerations," the government said in a statement. "Our two brother nations have always known how to read our shared past without anger and with a constructive perspective." There was no immediate comment from the Vatican but three years ago, on a visit to Mexico, Pope Francis asked indigenous people for forgiveness over the way they had been excluded from society. "Some have considered your values, culture and traditions to be inferior. Others, intoxicated by power, money and market trends, have stolen your lands or contaminated them. How sad this is," he said. "How worthwhile it would be for each of us to examine our conscience and learn to say, 'Forgive me!'" What was the Spanish conquest of the Americas? It started with an expedition led by Christopher Columbus in 1492. The conquest of Mexico began in 1519 when a small army led by Hernán Cortés landed in the modern-day state of Veracruz. Within two years, the Spanish had overcome the powerful Aztec Empire. Their victory was attributed to the skilled leadership of Cortés, who made local allies for his campaign against the Aztecs, as well as their superior weapons. Large numbers of indigenous people died in battle or in massacres such as that at Cholula, while diseases the Spanish inadvertently brought with them accounted for massive loss of life.
By the close of trade, the site had seen sales worth 91.2bn yuan ($14.3bn; £9.4bn), a 60% increase from last year. In comparison, sales on Cyber Monday, which is the biggest online shopping day in the US, hit $1.35bn, according to data analytics firm ComScore. Singles Day is held every year on 11 November. The day is also referred to as Double Eleven because of its date. James Bond, bragging and 'eating dirt' - China celebrates Singles Day Analysis: Celia Hatton, BBC News, Beijing Singles Day- Alibaba 80% share of China's total online shopping market 120,000 estimated orders each minute on 2015 Singles Day 73% of purchases in first hour made via mobile phone 12 hours time taken to beat 2014 whole-day record of $9.3bn The reaction to China's Singles Day shopping bonanza reflects the drama and excitement of China's capitalist holiday. "I wanted two different coats, but they both sold out in the first three minutes of the sale!", complained one young woman online. "I spent 2,000RMB last night ($315; £207)" exclaimed another. "Now I'm going to have to eat dirt if I'm hungry because I'm broke!" But don't mistake the rush to spend as a sign the Chinese economy is turning around. Many shoppers are well aware the economy is slowing. It is common for people to wait to spend on Singles Day to save money. New data supports nagging concerns about the economy. Inflation is down: non-food prices dropped 0.3% in October, indicating that consumption continues to fall in China - a long-term trend that Singles Day won't fix. Why China's big brands are cashing in on singles 'Power of Chinese consumption' Singles Day has grown tremendously since Alibaba began promoting it as a shopping day in 2009, and now includes many retailers such as rivals JD.com that stage sales promotions. This year, Alibaba said there would be more than 40,000 merchants and 30,000 brands from 25 countries selling goods on its platforms. More than 130 million users have already visited its marketplace app, Taobao, which exceeds the peak from last year. In the lead up to the event, the firm hosted a four-hour TV variety show featuring Chinese celebrities and Western entertainers such as British actor Daniel Craig of James Bond fame. American actor Kevin Spacey appeared as his character President Frank Underwood from the Netflix series House of Cards to wish shoppers a "happy Singles' Day" in a two minute video. Alibaba chief Executive Daniel Zhang had said in a statement that the event would mean "the whole world will witness the power of Chinese consumption". He promised consumers "a new surprise every hour" over the 24-hour marathon, especially mobile users. The firm said more than 27 million purchases came via mobile devices in the first hour. Although its competitors offered attractive discounts, Fangting Sun, China-based analyst at market research firm Euromonitor International said that consumers' attention was still focused on Alibaba's online marketplace Tmall.com. "[It's] not only due to the wide choices and competitive prices, but also the heavy marketing campaigns especially the successful gala evening which invited lots of famous entertainment stars," she said. Kitty Fok, China manager for market research firm IDC said online shopping had become a comfortable channel for most consumers. "China is a big market with close to one billion smart connected device users - it is a good news for both Alibaba and their competitors," she said. Massive scale Alibaba accounts for more than 80% of China's internet sales market. It predicts that 1.7 million couriers, 400,000 vehicles and 200 planes will be making deliveries of products that range from electronics goods to cosmetics despite slowing growth in China. Economists will be looking for clues about domestic consumption in Wednesday's sales as the world's second-biggest economy heads for its slowest growth in nearly a quarter of a century. Ms Sun of Euromonitor said the shopping event would not only stimulate domestic demand but also trade. "Alibaba aims to both attract more international players selling products to China and the domestic players to expand to the overseas markets," she added.
The long-awaited Australia-New Zealand travel bubble means visitors no longer need to quarantine on arrival. Thousands of passengers were booked to fly between the two nations on Monday. Both countries have contained Covid outbreaks and kept infection rates low, largely due to tight restrictions. Excited passengers crowded airports in Australia for flights to various parts of New Zealand on Monday, with some rising before dawn to get ready to board. "I didn't realise how emotional I was going to be today," passenger Dawn Tratt told the BBC at Sydney airport. While many buzzed with the anticipation of seeing loved ones, for others it was a more sombre occasion. "My older brother passed away last week on Thursday, we couldn't get there last week, but it's given us an opportunity to go back home today without quarantine so it's good, very good to go and lay him to rest," said John Palalagi in Sydney. Nirali Johal said she was going to see her partner for the first time in almost two years. "I couldn't sleep last night, it has been very exciting," she said. "We are just... happy that it has happened and we're able to live a normal life again." She said she was looking forward to "going to a café, chilling and do what people do on a normal day face-to-face." She added: "Zoom relations aren't great. I'm over it." Australia and New Zealand shut their borders in March last year and brought in compulsory quarantine for returning nationals. Since October, New Zealand travellers have been allowed to enter most Australian states without quarantine, though this had not been reciprocated amid concerns about sporadic Covid outbreaks. To fly under the bubble's rules, passengers must have spent 14 days before departure in either Australia or New Zealand. They must not be awaiting the results of a Covid test, nor have any Covid symptoms, amongst other criteria. 'It's weird being on a plane again' The international departure terminal at Sydney airport was very busy, very early in the day. The queue in front of the check-in desk was long and spiralling. Many parents tried to entertain exhausted toddlers who had to wake up exceptionally early to catch the first flight from Sydney to Auckland on Day 1 of the trans-Tasman bubble. Some passengers told me they camped outside from 02:00 local time (Sunday 17:00 GMT) before the airport had even opened. Others said they were so excited they couldn't sleep. The first Jetstar flight was absolutely full. It's a big day for airlines after a catastrophic year because of Covid, and a big sigh of relief for both the travel and tourism industries. But really, this moment is about friends and family reuniting with their loved ones. Dawn Tratt's voice broke a little as she spoke to me ahead of take-off in Sydney. Her cousin is unwell and while this is a hard time for her family, she's glad she'll be able to be there for her. "We're so privileged here in Australia and in New Zealand to be able to travel like that. It's weird being on a plane again," she smiled through her tears. Economic boost The bubble is expected to deliver a lift to both economies, Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison and New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a joint statement. "It is truly exciting to start quarantine-free travel with Australia. Be it returning family, friends or holiday-makers, New Zealand says welcome and enjoy yourself," Ms Ardern said. The country relies on Australia for 40% of its international tourism, injecting about NZ$2.7bn (£1.4bn, $1.9bn) into the economy. In the other direction, New Zealanders accounted for 1.3 million arrivals to Australia in 2019, contributing A$2.6bn (£1.46bn; $2bn) to the Australian economy. Qantas, Jetstar and Air New Zealand will all fly routes between the two countries. Still, the leaders warned the trans-Tasman travel bubble will be under "constant review" given the risks of quarantine-free travel. The two countries have also previously raised the idea of separate travel bubbles with low-risk places like Singapore, Taiwan and several Pacific island nations. Both nations have won praise for their handling of the Covid pandemic. Strict border controls and snap lockdowns are among the measures that have kept infection rates low. Australia has recorded 910 deaths, and New Zealand 26 deaths. Despite its success in containing outbreaks, the Australian government is facing growing criticism over delays in its Covid vaccination rollout. The country has fallen far behind other nations and failed to meet its immunisation targets. The delays are likely to slow any further easing of border restrictions.
By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News Construction of the ISS began in 1998 and is a joint venture between the US, Russia, Canada, Japan, and states in the European Space Agency (Esa). For the extension to happen, it will likely need the partners' support. Their current commitments run to 2020, but many engineers believe the station could work safely until at least 2028. Bill Gerstenmaier, the associate administrator at Nasa with responsibility for the station, told reporters that it was feasible to continue operating the ISS if some partners decided not to stay on board, but added that he expected them all to come through, even if the agreements took a few years to put in place: "I think the idea is that 10 years from today is a pretty far-reaching, pretty strategic decision," he said. "We have talked to the partners about this... They were involved in all the hardware studies. In general, they see this as a positive step moving forward." Certainly, Germany, Europe's biggest contributor to the ISS project is keen to see the $100bn orbiting platform operate for many years into the future. Jan Woerner, the chairman of the German space agency (DLR), said: "Germany is eager to use the ISS until 2020 and beyond. Full stop. This is the German position and we hope the other [European] member states will make the commitment and give the money for that." Prof Woerner was speaking in Washington DC where his national agency and Esa announced technical tie-ups with the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), which is developing a mini-space shuttle to carry astronauts to and from the ISS. At the moment, the station is solely reliant on Russian Soyuz capsules to rotate the platform's six-person crew. Nasa is therefore seeding American companies, including Sierra Nevada, to help them design and build alternatives. The mini-shuttle is known as the Dream Chaser and would launch atop an Atlas rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida. It is envisaged that the vehicle will make its maiden voyage into orbit in 2016, in an autonomous configuration; and then fly its first manned mission in 2017. With no crew transport capability of their own, DLR and Esa are keen to explore areas where they could cooperate with SNC on its Dream Chaser programme. "The first one is the docking mechanism - the mechanism that would connect the Dream Chaser to the space station," said Esa's Elena Grifoni Winters. "And the other area we are looking at is crew displays and crew aids." In addition, Germany has heatshield technology that it believes could protect the vehicle on re-entry equally as well as SNC's chosen material but which would also offer significant weight savings. These savings might then allow the Dream Chaser to carry heavier payloads into space, said Prof Woerner. He then put forward the idea that Europe itself could launch the mini-shuttle on its next version of the Ariane 5 rocket, which flies out of Kourou in French Guiana. "It's even possible with some minor changes to the Dream Chaser to launch it within the fairing (the clam-shell covering at the top of the rocket), but the Dream Chaser would need to be changed a little bit because the wings are a bit too big. Or one puts it on top of the Ariane 5 as it will be on the Atlas, but then we have to re-calculate all the aerodynamics," he told BBC News. The Ariane 5 was originally conceived as a human launcher, and Europe spent considerable funds designing its own mini-shuttle called Hermes to go on top of the rocket. Budget constraints eventually led to the Hermes project being cancelled. Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos
By BBC MonitoringThe world through its media The poll comes amid major tensions with North Korea, rising youth unemployment and bubbling anger among the electorate over corruption. Liberal Moon Jae-in, a human rights lawyer, has dominated opinion polls and is the clear front-runner. His closest rivals are Ahn Cheol-soo, a centre-left IT multi-millionaire, and Hong Joon-pyo, the ruling party candidate. Record numbers cast their ballots in early voting last week and turn-out is expected to be high. Why are people fired up? South Korea is still reeling from the money-for-influence scandal that engulfed the former president, who is currently awaiting trial after being impeached. Huge crowds had protested against Ms Park, amid anger over inequality and the perceived privilege of South Korea's elite. During months of protests older voters came out in support of her, however, exposing a deep generational divide. Whoever wins the election will have to reunite society and tackle the economic and social mobility issues that have energised the youth vote. Last year, youth unemployment stood at 9.8%, highlighting job-seeking challenges for young people. North Korea, meanwhile, remains a pressing challenge. Pyongyang has upped the pace of missile tests in recent months and many expect a sixth nuclear test soon. US leader Donald Trump has adopted a hard-line stance and tensions are at their highest level in years. Who are the main candidates? Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party is out in front of his rivals. An aide to former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun, he is trying his chances again after losing to Ms Park in 2012. A student activist, he was expelled from law school in the 1970s after leading a protest against Ms Park's father, strongman President Park Chung-Hee. After qualifying, he worked as a human rights lawyers for years before entering politics when Mr Roh was elected president. Domestically, he has talked of tackling the perceived untouchability of South Korea's huge family-run conglomerates and their cosy ties with the government. On North Korea, he has called for a new vision to achieve peace, one that potentially includes economic engagement - something that critics say channels funds to Pyongyang's nuclear programme. His position on the US missile system, Thaad, remains unclear, but he was critical of the move to roll it out last month. His spokesman called it "very inappropriate" as it stripped the next government of the right to make its own decision on the system. Mr Moon's most prominent rival is Ahn Cheol-soo, a software tycoon and co-founder of the centre-left People's Party. Nicknamed "Korea's Bill Gates", Mr Ahn has portrayed himself as above the corruption that has plagued the political scene. He has described himself as a "conservative in security issues and a reformist in economic affairs". On North Korea, he advocates pressure and dialogue to bring Pyongyang to the negotiating table. He was initially opposed to Thaad but has since said that he will respect an agreement made between countries. A third candidate who has slowly gained popularity is Hong Joon-pyo, from the conservative Liberty Korea Party. This is the party of the impeached Ms Park, previously known as the Saenuri Party. He says national security is top of his agenda. What challenges lie ahead? Though North Korea dominates dialogue on the international stage, for South Koreans it is domestic issues - jobs, transparency, good governance - where they want the new leadership to make rapid improvements. According to a survey by RealMeter, 27.5% said the key issue for them was a candidate's willingness to resolve corruption issues, followed by economic and livelihood issues at 24.5% and national security at 18.5%. But many commentators say the leading candidates have not provided detailed policies. On North Korea, the incoming president will have to contend with a leader in Pyongyang committed to the development of nuclear weapons, a bullish White House that has suggested military action could be on the table if tensions escalate and an electorate that could be caught in the crossfire. Initiating a policy of economic engagement could be very challenging amid these circumstances, analysts suggest. Balancing ties with the US - Seoul's traditional ally - will also be made more complicated by China's furious reaction to the Thaad deployment. Seoul and Washington say the system is aimed at safeguarding against attacks from North Korea, but Beijing says the missile system infringes on its own security and has initiated a number of informal economic sanctions. Mr Trump, meanwhile, recently suggested South Korea should pay for the system, causing consternation in the host nation. He's also threatened to scrap a "horrible" free-trade deal between the two.

President Barack Obama confirmed his resignation and paid tribute to his "class and integrity". Mr Hagel, 68, a Vietnam war veteran and former Republican senator, said it had been his life's "greatest privilege". Last month, it was reported that he was sharply critical of the US strategy against Islamic State and in relation to the Syria regime. He will stay on as secretary until his successor is confirmed. An unnamed official told the Associated Press news agency that Mr Hagel and Mr Obama both "determined that it was time for new leadership in the Pentagon" and had been discussing the move for weeks. Mr Obama said Mr Hagel had come to him to discuss the "appropriate time to complete his service". The US president said he was "extraordinary lucky" to have Mr Hagel by his side as defence secretary and praised him for forging a strong bond with US troops. Mr Hagel is the first enlisted combat veteran to serve in the role. In a brief statement, Mr Hagel said it had been the "great privilege of my life to lead and most importantly to serve the men and women of the defence department". Analysis, Jon Sopel, North America Editor Chuck Hagel is a friendly, no-nonsense defence secretary. He was also the one Republican in the White House national security set-up. But that may be of lesser importance than him being appointed to do one task in the Pentagon, only to find that the job description has changed fundamentally. He was the man appointed to bring the troops home and pare back the huge defence budget. But then Islamic State came along and all the calculations changed, and Mr Obama and his defence chief found themselves at odds. There was a lack of clear strategy, perhaps because Mr Obama and Mr Hagel didn't agree on what it should be. And after mid-term political defeats, the president needs a military win. So a change at the top will be an important symbol of that determination. Which of course leaves the question, did he jump or was he pushed? Probably a bit of both. Mr Hagel, who served as Republican senator for his home state of Nebraska for 12 years, became critical of US involvement in Iraq despite voting to authorise the war. He replaced Leon Panetta as defence secretary in Mr Obama's second term, taking on the task of winding down the Afghanistan war and making a military shift towards Asia. But the future of US military policy has changed amid air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria. "The next couple of years will demand a different kind of focus," an unnamed White House official told the New York Times, which first broke the story. US media report there was increasing tension between Mr Hagel and the administration over decisions in Syria and working styles, citing Hagel confidantes and senior defence officials. Republican Senator John McCain said he knew the defence secretary "was frustrated with aspects of the administration's national security policy and decision-making process". Mr McCain said Mr Obama needed to realise "current failures on national security more often lie with his administration's misguided policies". Mr Obama did not name a replacement for Mr Hagel on Monday. Once named, the nominee would have to be confirmed by the Senate. Among those being considered as replacements for Mr Hagel is Michele Flournoy, the former Pentagon policy chief during Mr Obama's first term. If nominated and confirmed Ms Flournoy would be the first female US defence secretary.
He met a delegation of Venezuelan officials on a solidarity mission to Cuba at a local school. The 88-year-old revolutionary icon was described as "full of vitality" by local press. He was last seen in public in January 2014 at the opening of a Havana cultural centre sponsored by one of his favourite Cuban artists, Alexis Leyva. This time, official media showed images of a seated Mr Castro shaking hands with the Venezuelan visitors through the window of his vehicle, wearing a baseball cap and windbreaker. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, oil-rich Venezuela has become Cuba's closest ally. Mr Castro was a close friend of the former Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, who ensured Cuba received cheap oil. In return, Cuba supplied its ally with Cuban advisers, doctors and teachers. Fidel Castro provisionally stepped down due to illness in 2006, and formally announced his retirement in 2008, handing over to his younger brother Raul, 83. He occasionally writes a newspaper column and receives dignitaries at home, but rarely appears in public.
Mario Draghi, the bank's president, said a stronger euro would act as a trigger to looser monetary policy. The rise of the single currency's exchange rate is one of the main reasons eurozone inflation is at a dangerously low 0.5%. One of Mr Draghi's stimulus options would be quantitative easing (QE). That is something the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been suggesting as concerns grow about deflation in the eurozone. 'Further stimulus' Speaking after the IMF's spring meeting in Washington, Mr Draghi hinted that QE - the large-scale purchase of financial assets - may be needed. "If you want policy to remain as accommodative as now, a further strengthening of the exchange rate would require further stimulus," he said. Earlier this month the ECB kept interest rates steady, at a historic low of 0.25%, but Mr Draghi said its members were unanimous in their willingness to begin QE if inflation stayed well below their 2% target. Their fear is that falling inflation could harm the eurozone's fragile economic recovery by reducing consumer spending - because people would be likely to put off purchases, believing prices will continue to fall. Low inflation also means governments and businesses find it more difficult to repay their debts. However, most analysts believe Mr Draghi's more likely choice would be a further cut in the ECB's benchmark interest rate, currently at a record low of 0.25%. Strong euro The bank's policymakers recently raised the idea of cutting the rate to below zero, effectively charging banks that hold excess cash at the ECB. Such measures could be needed, Mr Draghi said, because of a euro that has strengthened by nearly 5.5% against the dollar, and by nearly 10% against the Japanese yen in the last year. The euro is currently worth $1.39. The currency's strength, Mr Draghi said on Saturday, accounted for a half percentage point of the decline in the annual inflation rate. "I have always said that the exchange rate is not a policy target, but it is important for price stability and growth," he added. "What has happened over the last few months is that it has become more and more important for price stability."
Jessica Krug, an associate professor whose work focuses on Africa and the African diaspora, admitted in a blog post last week that she was in fact a "white Jewish" woman from Kansas City. The post read: "I have built my life on a violent anti-black lie." Her colleagues said they were "shocked and appalled" by her admission. In a Medium post published last Thursday, Ms Krug said she had falsely assumed identities "that I had no right to claim: first North African Blackness, then US rooted Blackness, then Caribbean rooted Bronx Blackness". In a tweet on Wednesday, George Washington University said Ms Krug had "resigned her position, effective immediately". "Her classes for this semester will be taught by other faculty members, and students in those courses will receive additional information this week," it added. She has not commented. What did she say in her post? Ms Krug described her behaviour as "the very epitome of violence, of thievery and appropriation, of the myriad ways in which non-Black people continue to use and abuse Black identities and cultures." She added that she had continued the pretence even in her personal relationships. She cited mental health issues and trauma experienced in her early years, although she said this was not an excuse for her actions. According to media reports, Ms Krug also used the name Jessica La Bombalera as an activist. In one video posted earlier this year, she berated white New Yorkers for failing to "yield their time for Black and Brown indigenous New Yorkers". Ms Krug's academic work includes the 2018 book Fugitive Modernities: Kisama and the Politics of Freedom, which focuses on the politics and culture of African and African diaspora societies. Her case bears strong parallels to race activist Rachel Dolezal, a white woman who claimed to be black. After her parents outed her in 2015, she said she "identified as black". On Friday, following the publication of her blog post, Ms Krug's colleagues at GWU's Department of History released a joint statement calling for her to resign from her post or for the university to remove her tenure. The university said then Ms Krug would not teach classes and acknowledged "many students, faculty, staff and alumni [were] hurting". You may also be interested in:
The two pages of tax return, revealed by US TV network MSNBC, also showed he wrote off $103m in losses. It gave no details on income sources. The White House said publishing the tax return was against the law. Mr Trump refused to release his tax returns during the election campaign, breaking with a long-held tradition. How was it found? On Tuesday evening, MSNBC announced that it had a copy of one of Mr Trump's tax returns, dating from 2005. The details were revealed on a show later that night, anchored by journalist Rachel Maddow. MSNBC said they received the document from financial journalist and Trump biographer David Cay Johnston, who received it in the post from an anonymous source. On the programme Mr Cay Johnston confirmed he had no further details on the source, but speculated that the leak could have come from Mr Trump himself. Although leaking federal tax returns is a criminal offence, Ms Maddow argued that the network was exercising its right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment to the US Constitution to publish information in the public interest. On Wednesday morning, President Trump slammed Mr Cay Johnston on Twitter, and cast doubt on the claim that the papers came unsolicited through the post. The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist said he and his family received threats over the report, calling it a "disturbing sign of how Trump damages civil debate". "Trump fans call & harass my wife & one of my children after I break story White House confirmed. Sad! Let's have open debate, not threats," he tweeted. What have we learnt? The release showed Mr Trump paid the Internal Revenue Service $38m in 2005, an effective tax rate of 24%. This is higher than the average American citizen would pay but below the 27.4% averaged by higher-earning taxpayers. The bill comprises $5.3m in federal income tax and an extra $31m in what is called alternative minimum tax (AMT). AMT was set up nearly 50 years ago to stop the wealthiest people from using deductions and loopholes to avoid paying taxes. Mr Trump has called for it to be abolished. What don't we know? President Trump's critics have wanted to know more about his income tax payments, but they also want more transparency on his business ties, particularly on any links to Russia. No substantial business links have been proven. The two-page form only gives basic figures and offers no insight into the sources of his earnings. It also does not give details on any charity donations. Last October, the New York Times revealed parts of Mr Trump's 1995 tax returns that showed losses of $916m (£753m). The newspaper said this could have affected his returns for up to 18 subsequent years, allowing him to legally avoid paying federal income taxes. The forms disclosed on Tuesday do not say whether the £103m write-down that Mr Trump recorded in 2005 is connected to the losses in 1995. Why has Trump not released his tax returns? Every US presidential candidate since 1976 has released their tax returns although there is no legal requirement to do so. Throughout his presidential campaign and since his election, Mr Trump has refused to release his returns. He has said he is under audit by tax authorities and that his lawyers advise against releasing the documents. The US Internal Revenue Service has a policy not to confirm whether or not individuals are under audit, but says it does not stop anyone from releasing their own returns. Mr Trump's critics have created numerous petitions calling for their full release, including one that gathered over a million signatures. During last year's election campaign, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton accused Mr Trump in a head-to-head debate of paying no federal income tax. He responded: "That makes me smart." Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington We now have another snippet, just the smallest glimpse, into Donald Trump's personal financial empire. The few pages from 2005 reveal that the alternative minimum tax, first instituted in 1970, did what it was supposed to do - prevent a very wealthy individual from paying a relatively tiny amount of federal taxes. Beyond that, the contours of Mr Trump's personal wealth remain a mystery. Only supporting tax documentation, not included in this leak, could show the details of Mr Trump's income, including sources both domestic and international. For a few moments, the political world thought a political bombshell was about to drop on the White House. In fact, it was more like lightning at night - a quick flash, then a return to darkness. Could the Trump administration be behind the leaks? In the past, Mr Trump is alleged to have called the US media and used a pseudonym to give them favourable stories about his business dealings. Mr Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr, said on Twitter that he was thankful for the release as they showed his father was paying taxes. However, in a statement issued before the broadcast, the White House was less enthusiastic, saying: "You know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago." It has also said Mr Trump had a responsibility to pay no more tax than was legally required. What happens next? Correspondents say that, despite the lack of detail, the leak is significant because so little is known about President Trump's tax affairs and the new information could increase pressure on him to release more.
The $2.3tn (£1.7tn) proposal would direct billions to initiatives such as charging stations for electric vehicles and eliminating lead water pipes. The spending would be partially offset by raising taxes on businesses. Those plans have already roused fierce opposition. Republicans have called the rises "a recipe for stagnation and decline", while powerful business lobby groups including the Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce said they supported investments but would oppose tax increases. The pushback is a sign of the tough fight ahead for the plan, which needs approval from Congress. Acrimony looms Joe Biden could have gone in a number of different policy directions after narrowly getting his covid pandemic aid package through Congress. That he opted to push for an infrastructure bill, rather than upping the pressure for gun control, voting rights, immigration, the environment or healthcare reform, suggests he's looking for a popular, non-controversial legislative second act. Of course, like that coronavirus package, the Biden administration is likely to use a massive piece of legislation to quietly advance some of those other policy priorities. The proposal contains hundreds of millions of dollars in green energy spending, expanded care for the elderly and disabled and job training, for instance. Also like the coronavirus aid bill, even non-controversial infrastructure provisions that have high public support will be swamped in partisan acrimony. In particular, Republicans are going to vehemently object to the tax increases for corporations and businesses contained in the proposed legislation. Chances are, Democrats will again have to go it alone when it comes to passing Biden's legislative agenda. The challenge, then, will be keeping the Democratic coalition together at a time when a wide number of constituencies, many of whom held their tongue during the Covid negotiations, line up to ensure their priorities are funded. The White House has promoted its proposal as the most ambitious public spending in decades, saying the investments are necessary to keep the US economy growing and competitive with other countries, especially China. "This is not a plan that tinkers around the edges," Mr Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Wednesday. "It's a once in a generation investment in America." What's in the American Jobs Plan? It calls for investing more than $600bn in infrastructure, including modernising roads, replacing rail cars and buses and repairing crumbling bridges. Billions more would be devoted to initiatives like improving veterans hospitals, upgrading affordable housing, expanding high-speed broadband, and providing incentives for manufacturing and technology research. It calls for money to be directed to rural communities and communities of colour, including establishing a national climate-focused laboratory affiliated with an historically black university. The spending, which would have to be approved by Congress, would roll out over eight years. The White House said tax increases would offset the cost over 15 years. Mr Biden called for raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, a move that would partially undo cuts the US passed in 2017. He also proposed raising the minimum rate charged for overseas profits. In his speech, in an acknowledgment such plans are likely to face, he said he was also "open to other ideas" when it came to paying for the spending. "Failing to make these investments adds to our debt and effectively puts our children at a disadvantage relative to our competitors," he said. "The divisions of the moment shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing for the future." Will it pass? Mr Biden's proposal - which closely resembles promises he made during last year's election campaign - comes just weeks after Democrats muscled through $1.9tn more in aid to address the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic, approving that package without Republican support. It's not clear yet how much of Mr Biden's latest plan will make it through Congress - or how much of another spending package focused on areas such as childcare and education that he plans to unveil in coming weeks. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the speedy advance of the pandemic package was unusual. "Normally the negotiations drag on for months and what eventually gets passed, if anything gets passed at all, bears only a passing resemblance to what the administration originally asked for," he said. "We suspect these negotiations will revert to the mean." Eli Allen is director of the Center for Sustainable Careers at Civic Works, a non-profit organisation that offers programmes such as job training focused on careers in sustainable energy in Baltimore, Maryland, a majority black city near Washington, DC. He said he was "cautiously optimistic" that something resembling Mr Biden's ambitions would eventually pass and was particularly heartened by Mr Biden's emphasis on creating "quality jobs" in terms of pay and benefits - which he said could help set a standard across the industry. "The focus on racial equity is not something we've seen in some of the past federal programmes that we've worked with," he added. "I think that focus … is very important as we think about strategies to expand access to these jobs, especially for communities of colour." 'Prioritising infrastructure in a new way' Stefani Pashman is chief executive of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, a regional economic development group in Pittsburgh, the former steel town in Pennsylvania where Mr Biden delivered his speech on Wednesday. The city, located in a state that was key to Mr Biden's election victory, has been working to reinvent itself as a centre for high-tech research in areas such as autonomous vehicles. Ms Pashman said the president's promise of billions of government dollars has also injected new energy into ambitious local plans, like an effort by Carnegie Mellon University and rail technology company Wabtec to establish a new research lab focused on innovations in freight rail, like autonomous trains. "The idea is to transform the rail industry … but we need $600m from the federal government to amplify what we're able to do at the local level," she said. "The past few years … I don't think the government was positioned to take this on at the level that it needs to be addressed and invested in to propel our region's economy and all the economies of the nation," she added. "It's clear that they're prioritizing infrastructure in a new way."
The Swedish Academy has been in crisis over its handling of allegations against the husband of a member. She has since quit, as have the academy's head and four other members. The academy says it will now announce the 2018 winner along with the 2019 winner next year. The scandal is the biggest to hit the prize since it was first awarded in 1901. Apart from six years during the world wars, there has been only one year when the prize was not awarded. No worthy winner was found in 1935. This year's other Nobel prizes will go ahead as usual. What did the academy say? In a statement on its website, the academy said: "The present decision was arrived at in view of the currently diminished Academy and the reduced public confidence in the Academy." It said that the academy's "operative practices need to be evolved", including tackling its statutes, conflict-of-interest issues and management of information. Some academy members had argued that the prize should proceed to protect the tradition, but others said the institution was in no state to present the award. The #MeToo campaign, which showed the prevalence of sexual assault globally, may have played a part in the academy's decision. It would have been difficult for potential winners to accept the prize with the academy in such turmoil. Academy faces struggle to regain reputation Analysis by Maddy Savage, BBC News, Stockholm This is an unusual but not entirely unexpected decision here in Sweden where internal spats between members and former members of the Swedish Academy have been headline news for months. The institution has faced deep criticism from the academic community with hundreds of professors, lecturers and researchers signing a number of letters calling for the academy to take action to restore its credibility. But this is a scandal that's also captured wider attention. Many Swedes are fiercely proud of the Nobel prizes and the fact that they live in a country that usually champions women's rights. Seeing the prestigious literature award committee unravel off the back of the mishandling of sexual assault allegations has been a bitter pill to swallow. Not everyone is confident the academy will regain its reputation in time for next year's prize announcements. What sparked the crisis? Divisions started to emerge last November when French photographer Jean-Claude Arnault, who ran a cultural project with funding from the Swedish Academy, was accused by 18 women of sexual assault. Several of the alleged incidents reportedly happened in properties belonging to the academy. Mr Arnault denies the allegations. The organisation later voted against removing Mr Arnault's wife, the poet and writer Katarina Frostenson, from its committee. This, along with accusations of conflict of interest and the leaking of Nobel winners' names, divided the organisation. What followed was a wave of resignations, including Ms Frostenson and the head of the academy, Prof Sara Danius. Only 11 members are now in place. Of those, one, Kerstin Ekman, has been inactive since 1989, when the academy refused to condemn the fatwa issued over Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses. The academy's statutes require a quorum of 12 to vote in any new members. Technically, members are appointed for life to the Swedish Academy and cannot resign, although they can refuse to take part. Academy patron King Carl XVI Gustaf has said he will change the rules to allow them to quit formally. So what happens next? The academy said: "Work on the selection of a laureate is at an advanced stage and will continue as usual in the months ahead but the Academy needs time to regain its full complement, engage a larger number of active members and regain confidence in its work, before the next Literature Prize winner is declared." Two prizes for literature will be announced next year, one for 2018 and one for 2019. This is not the first time this has happened. On five occasions a prize for one year has been awarded at the same time as the following year's prize. For example, American playwright Eugene O'Neill was given the 1936 award in 1937. What's the social reaction been? A number have highlighted the importance of #MeToo, among other theories and opinions, including the neglect of Kenyan writer Ngugi wa Thiong'o... The Nobel prizes
US President Barack Obama said that with the deal, "every pathway to a nuclear weapon is cut off" for Iran. And President Hassan Rouhani said the "historic" deal opened a "new chapter" in Iran's relations with the world. Negotiations between Iran and six world powers - the US, UK, France, China, Russia and Germany - began in 2006. The so-called P5+1 want Iran to scale back its sensitive nuclear activities to ensure that it cannot build a nuclear weapon. Iran, which wants crippling international sanctions lifted, has always insisted that its nuclear work is peaceful. Follow our live updates A good deal, for now? Deal shakes Middle East media Good or bad for Middle East? There has been stiff resistance to a deal from conservatives both in Iran and the US. The US Congress has 60 days in which to consider the deal, though Mr Obama said he would veto any attempt to block it. The Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives, John Boehner, said the deal would only only "embolden" Tehran. "Instead of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East, this deal is likely to fuel a nuclear arms race around the world," he added. Israel's government has also warned against an agreement. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it was a "stunning historic mistake" that would provide Iran with "hundreds of billions of dollars with which it can fuel its terror machine and its expansion and aggression throughout the Middle East and across the globe". He said he did not regard Israel as being bound by this agreement. "We will always defend ourselves," he added. In a televised address, Mr Obama insisted the deal would make the world "safer and more secure", and provided for a rigorous verification regime. "This deal is not built on trust - it is built on verification," he said. Immediately afterwards, Mr Rouhani gave his own televised address, in which he said the prayers of Iranians had "come true". He said the deal would lead to the removal of all sanctions, adding: "The sanctions regime was never successful, but at the same time it affected people's lives.'' After 12 years, world powers had finally "recognised the nuclear activities of Iran", he said. Analysis: Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor The agreement will change the Middle East, perhaps a lot, but at the moment no-one knows exactly how. The biggest question is whether it will reduce or increase the turmoil in the Middle East. Iran and the world's big powers, most significantly the US, now have a habit of working together - but don't assume that will help automatically to resolve the crises and wars that Iran, the US and their allies are involved with in the region. There is a danger that mutual suspicion will heat up the Middle East's fault lines, especially the cold war between Iran and Saudi Arabia - and with it sectarian conflict between Shia and Sunni Muslims. But the agreement in Vienna removes Iran's nuclear programme from the danger list. Two years ago, as Israel threatened to bomb Iran, it looked likely to lead to a major Middle East war. That in itself is a major diplomatic achievement. Both Mr Rouhani and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif referred to the dispute over Iran's nuclear programme as an "unnecessary crisis". Mr Zarif said the deal was "not perfect for anybody'', but that it was the "best achievement possible that could be reached". Mr Obama, who is trying to persuade a sceptical US Congress of the benefits, said it would oblige Iran to: Sanctions relief would be gradual, Mr Obama said, with an arms embargo remaining in place for five years and an embargo on missiles for eight years. Separately, the IAEA and Iran said they had signed a roadmap to resolve outstanding issues. IAEA head Yukiya Amano told reporters in Vienna, Austria, that his organisation had signed a roadmap "for the clarification of past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear programme". He called the agreement a "significant step forward", saying it would allow the agency to "make an assessment of issues relating to possible military dimensions to Iran's nuclear programme by the end of 2015".
By Juliana LiuHong Kong correspondent, BBC News Hong Kong's best-known lesbian, Gigi Chao, whose billionaire father famously offered $100m (£60m) to any man in the world who can marry her, said the refusal was a "disgrace". "Yes, we are disappointed, but the news is not unexpected as this former colony is clearly intent on governing from the depths of denial and siding with the populist ochlocracy [mob rule] of homophobic groups," she says. She says she hopes the right will be extended, but it may not be so simple, legally speaking. After years of debate, same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in March. Starting in June, the legislation was extended to cover British nationals overseas. British embassies and consulates are allowed to conduct same-sex marriages for couples in which at least one partner is a UK national. The marriage service is offered only in countries where gay marriage is not normally allowed, and can only take place if the host government does not object. "Unfortunately, the Hong Kong government has raised an objection to the solemnisation of same-sex marriages in Hong Kong," said a spokeswoman at the British consulate. Countries seen as less cosmopolitan and progressive than Hong Kong have allowed the marriages. They include the Philippines, Vietnam, Russia and even mainland China, whose domestic policies are generally run separately from Hong Kong. Australia, under the socially conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott, has agreed to allow the ceremonies to go ahead, even though the marriages would not be legally recognised. When asked, the protocol department of the Hong Kong government declined to comment directly on its objection. "It would be for individual consulates general to decide what functions and services they would wish to provide their nationals," it said in a statement. "Although Hong Kong does not have laws on same-sex marriage, the government is firmly committed to promoting equal opportunities on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity." The controversy comes in the same week that gay and lesbian rights activists like Ms Chao are preparing to launch the Pink Dot rally in Hong Kong. Sexual minorities and their families and friends have been invited to the public event, featuring free concerts by some of the city's well-known gay and lesbian entertainers. The Pink Dot movement actually began in 2009 in Singapore, another former British colony where UK nationals will not be allowed to marry their same-sex partners.
Where do they come from? The Kurds are one of the indigenous peoples of the Mesopotamian plains and the highlands in what are now south-eastern Turkey, north-eastern Syria, northern Iraq, north-western Iran and south-western Armenia. Today, they form a distinctive community, united through race, culture and language, even though they have no standard dialect. They also adhere to a number of different religions and creeds, although the majority are Sunni Muslims. Kurdistan: A State of Uncertainty Why don't they have a state? In the early 20th Century, many Kurds began to consider the creation of a homeland - generally referred to as "Kurdistan". After World War One and the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, the victorious Western allies made provision for a Kurdish state in the 1920 Treaty of Sevres. Such hopes were dashed three years later, however, when the Treaty of Lausanne, which set the boundaries of modern Turkey, made no provision for a Kurdish state and left Kurds with minority status in their respective countries. Over the next 80 years, any move by Kurds to set up an independent state was brutally quashed. Aiming to change the outcome of World War One Why were Kurds at the forefront of the fight against IS? In mid-2013, the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) turned its sights on three Kurdish enclaves that bordered territory under its control in northern Syria. It launched repeated attacks that until mid-2014 were repelled by the People's Protection Units (YPG) - the armed wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). An IS advance in northern Iraq in June 2014 also drew that country's Kurds into the conflict. The government of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan Region sent its Peshmerga forces to areas abandoned by the Iraqi army. In August 2014, the jihadists launched a surprise offensive and the Peshmerga withdrew from several areas. A number of towns inhabited by religious minorities fell, notably Sinjar, where IS militants killed or captured thousands of Yazidis. In response, a US-led multinational coalition launched air strikes in northern Iraq and sent military advisers to help the Peshmerga. The YPG and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades and has bases in Iraq, also came to their aid. In September 2014, IS launched an assault on the enclave around the northern Syrian Kurdish town of Kobane, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee across the nearby Turkish border. Despite the proximity of the fighting, Turkey refused to attack IS positions or allow Turkish Kurds to cross to defend it. In January 2015, after a battle that left at least 1,600 people dead, Kurdish forces regained control of Kobane. The Kurds - fighting alongside several local Arab militias under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance, and helped by US-led coalition air strikes, weapons and advisers - then steadily drove IS out of tens of thousands of square kilometres of territory in north-eastern Syria and established control over a large stretch of the border with Turkey. In October 2017, SDF fighters captured the de facto IS capital of Raqqa and then advanced south-eastwards into the neighbouring province of Deir al-Zour - the jihadists' last major foothold in Syria. The last pocket of territory held by IS in Syria - around the village of Baghouz - fell to the SDF in March 2019. The SDF hailed the "total elimination" of the IS "caliphate", but it warned that jihadist sleeper cells remained "a great threat". The SDF was also left to deal with the thousands of suspected IS militants captured during the last two years of the battle, as well as tens of thousands of displaced women and children associated with IS fighters. The US called for the repatriation of foreign nationals among them, but most of their home countries refused. In October 2019, US troops pulled back from the border with Turkey after the country's president said it was about to launch an operation to set up a 32km (20-mile) deep "safe zone" clear of YPG fighters and resettle up to 2 million Syrian refugees there. The SDF said it had been "stabbed in the back" by the US and warned that the offensive might reverse the defeat of IS, the fight against which it said it could no longer prioritise. Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels made steady gains in the first few days of the operation. In response, the SDF turned to the Syrian government for help and reached a deal for the Syrian army to deploy along the border. The Syrian government has vowed to take back control of all of Syria. What has Kobane battle taught us? Raqqa: The city fit for no-one Why does Turkey see Kurds as a threat? There is deep-seated hostility between the Turkish state and the country's Kurds, who constitute 15% to 20% of the population. Kurds received harsh treatment at the hands of the Turkish authorities for generations. In response to uprisings in the 1920s and 1930s, many Kurds were resettled, Kurdish names and costumes were banned, the use of the Kurdish language was restricted, and even the existence of a Kurdish ethnic identity was denied, with people designated "Mountain Turks". In 1978, Abdullah Ocalan established the PKK, which called for an independent state within Turkey. Six years later, the group began an armed struggle. Since then, more than 40,000 people have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced. In the 1990s the PKK rolled back on its demand for independence, calling instead for greater cultural and political autonomy, but continued to fight. In 2013, a ceasefire was agreed after secret talks were held. The ceasefire collapsed in July 2015, after a suicide bombing blamed on IS killed 33 young activists in the mainly Kurdish town of Suruc, near the Syrian border. The PKK accused the authorities of complicity and attacked Turkish soldiers and police. The Turkish government subsequently launched what it called a "synchronised war on terror" against the PKK and IS. Since then, several thousand people - including hundreds of civilians - have been killed in clashes in south-eastern Turkey. Turkey has maintained a military presence in northern Syria since August 2016, when it sent troops and tanks over the border to support a Syrian rebel offensive against IS. Those forces captured the key border town of Jarablus, preventing the YPG-led SDF from seizing the territory itself and linking up with the Kurdish enclave of Afrin to the west. In 2018, Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels launched an operation to expel YPG fighters from Afrin. Dozens of civilians were killed and tens of thousands displaced. Turkey's government says the YPG and the PYD are extensions of the PKK, share its goal of secession through armed struggle, and are terrorist organisations that must be eliminated. Turkey's fear of a reignited Kurdish flame Profile: The PKK What do Syria's Kurds want? Kurds make up between 7% and 10% of Syria's population. Before the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in 2011 most lived in the cities of Damascus and Aleppo, and in three, non-contiguous areas around Kobane, Afrin, and the north-eastern city of Qamishli. Syria's Kurds have long been suppressed and denied basic rights. Some 300,000 have been denied citizenship since the 1960s, and Kurdish land has been confiscated and redistributed to Arabs in an attempt to "Arabize" Kurdish regions. When the uprising evolved into a civil war, the main Kurdish parties publicly avoided taking sides. In mid-2012, government forces withdrew to concentrate on fighting the rebels elsewhere, and Kurdish groups took control in their wake. In January 2014, Kurdish parties - including the dominant Democratic Union Party (PYD) - declared the creation of "autonomous administrations" in the three "cantons" of Afrin, Kobane and Jazira. In March 2016, they announced the establishment of a "federal system" that included mainly Arab and Turkmen areas captured from IS. The declaration was rejected by the Syrian government, the Syrian opposition, Turkey and the US. The PYD says it is not seeking independence, but insists that any political settlement to end the conflict in Syria must include legal guarantees for Kurdish rights and recognition of Kurdish autonomy. President Assad has vowed to retake "every inch" of Syrian territory, whether by negotiations or military force. His government has also rejected Kurdish demands for autonomy, saying that "nobody in Syria accepts talk about independent entities or federalism". Will Iraq's Kurds gain independence? Kurds make up an estimated 15% to 20% of Iraq's population. They have historically enjoyed more national rights than Kurds living in neighbouring states, but also faced brutal repression. In 1946, Mustafa Barzani formed the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) to fight for autonomy in Iraq. But it was not until 1961 that he launched a full armed struggle. In the late 1970s, the government began settling Arabs in areas with Kurdish majorities, particularly around the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, and forcibly relocating Kurds. The policy was accelerated in the 1980s during the Iran-Iraq War, in which the Kurds backed the Islamic republic. In 1988, Saddam Hussein unleashed a campaign of vengeance on the Kurds that included the chemical attack on Halabja. When Iraq was defeated in the 1991 Gulf War, Barzani's son Massoud and Jalal Talabani of the rival Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) led a Kurdish rebellion. Its violent suppression prompted the US and its allies to impose a no-fly zone in the north that allowed Kurds to enjoy self-rule. The KDP and PUK agreed to share power, but tensions rose and a four-year war erupted between them in 1994. The parties co-operated with the US-led invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam and governed in coalition in the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), created two years later to administer Dohuk, Irbil and Sulaimaniya provinces. Massoud Barzani was appointed the region's president, while Jalal Talabani became Iraq's first non-Arab head of state. In September 2017, a referendum on independence was held in both the Kurdistan Region and the disputed areas seized by the Peshmerga in 2014, including Kirkuk. The vote was opposed by the Iraqi central government, which insisted it was illegal. More than 90% of the 3.3 million people who voted supported secession. KRG officials said the result gave them a mandate to start negotiations with Baghdad, but then Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi demanded that it be annulled. The following month Iraqi pro-government forces retook the disputed territory held by the Kurds. The loss of Kirkuk and its oil revenue was a major blow to Kurdish aspirations for their own state. After his gamble backfired, Mr Barzani stepped down as the Kurdistan Region's president. But disagreements between the main parties meant the post remained vacant until June 2019, when he was succeeded by his nephew Nechirvan. Iraqi Kurdistan: State-in-the-making? Iraqi Kurdistan profile
By Wyre DaviesBBC News, Rio de Janeiro They told the BBC that Zika could be behind more damaging neurological conditions, affecting the babies of up to a fifth of infected pregnant women. Rates of increase in Zika infection in some parts of Brazil have slowed, thanks to better information about preventing the disease. But the search for a vaccine is still in the early stages. And Zika continues to spread across the region. What you need to know: How dangerous is Zika? 2.2 billion in 'at risk' Zika areas Travel advice: Countries affected and what you should do Most doctors and medical researchers now agree that there is a link between the Zika virus and microcephaly, where babies are born with abnormally small heads because of restricted brain development. While it is estimated that 1% of women who have had Zika during pregnancy will have a child with microcephaly, leading doctors in Brazil have told the BBC that as many as 20% of Zika-affected pregnancies will result in a range of other forms of brain damage to the baby in the womb. A separate study, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, said that "29% of scans showed abnormalities in babies in the womb, including growth restrictions, in women infected with Zika". "Our findings are worrisome because 29% of ultrasonograms showed abnormalities, including intrauterine growth restrictions and foetal death, in women with positive Zika infection," the study said. Zika: What are the symptoms? Deaths are rare and only one in five people infected is thought to develop symptoms. These include: A rare nervous system disorder, Guillain-Barre syndrome, that can cause temporary paralysis has been linked to the infection. There is no vaccine or drug treatment so patients are advised to rest and drink plenty of fluids. But the biggest concern is the impact it could have on babies developing in the womb. Zika virus: Special report Many of the conditions that Brazilian doctors are noticing in babies born to mothers who had Zika are not as obvious to the untrained eye as microcephaly. They may not have the same impact on the child's development either but the frequency with which they are occurring is alarming. Doctor Renato Sa is a senior obstetrician who works in both public and private hospitals in Rio de Janeiro. "There are cerebral calcifications, an increase in the number of dilation of cerebral ventricles and the destruction or malformation of the posterior part of the brain," he says. In my notebook he makes a list of the conditions that they are now witnessing with increasing regularity; ventriculomegaly, damage of the posterior fossa, craniocynostosis and cerebral calcification. He says that an added concern is that often there is no obvious sign or symptom of the neurological damage until later observations of the child's development, "perhaps convulsions or other tell-tale signs". 'Shocked' There is an obvious urgency to understand more about Zika and develop a vaccine. At the Instituto D'Or laboratories in Rio de Janeiro they are using stem-cell technology to create new cells that develop like human brains. They call them "mini brains" and infect them with Zika. "What we observed is that the Zika virus is able to kill cells, is able to affect the growth of cells," says Dr Stevens Rehen, the unit's senior neuroscientist. Dr Rehen has noted, as have others, that there is something particularly virulent about the strain of Zika that arrived in Brazil and is presently spreading across the continent. "There is something in the Zika virus that makes it more prone to kill neurocells during development. Now we need to search and understand what makes that virus more aggressive to the brain under development." The team was shocked by what it discovered - a huge reduction in growth of the cerebral cortex, the critical outer layer of the brain. "The effect of the Zika virus was very impressive," says Dr Patricia Garcez. "We were all astonished by the fast effect. We saw cell death in three days, a massive cell death. In six days, the neurospheres were completely gone." In a change to earlier patterns, the areas of greatest infection for Zika are now in the south of the country, particularly in Rio de Janeiro. Among some sectors of society, public information campaigns about the need for using anti-mosquito repellent and taking other precautions appear to be having a positive impact. Dr Sa says that the number of Zika cases among middle-class pregnant women has fallen sharply, as have cases of microcephaly and other related conditions. But he says that the disappointing reality is that such progress is not apparent in the city's many poor working-class neighbourhoods, such as Duque de Caxias in the north of Rio de Janeiro. At the scene in Duque de Caxias neighbourhood I met Fabiane Lopes, a single mother of four children whose partner abandoned her when he found out the youngest child was going to be born with microcephaly. Given her plight - living in a tiny single-room house and dependant on government welfare - Ms Lopes is stoical. She has to be. Four-month old Valentina needs all the love, attention and therapy she can get. "We've seen no anti-Zika campaigns around here," says Ms Lopes, illustrating that government messages about Zika control are not getting through to everyone. She admits never having used anti-mosquito repellent and not being particularly careful about covering up when she was pregnant. Ms Lopez clearly loves her little girl, despite the tough start in life that she has been dealt. Her other children help with the chores that an absent father has abrogated. This is a family and a country is still learning how damaging the Zika virus and its consequences can be. Have you been affected by the Zika virus outbreak?

By Helen BriggsBBC News The area is now dominated by salt pans, but was once home to an enormous lake, which may have been our ancestral heartland 200,000 years ago. Our ancestors settled for 70,000 years, until the local climate changed, researchers have proposed. They began to move on as fertile green corridors opened up, paving the way for future migrations out of Africa. "It has been clear for some time that anatomically modern humans appeared in Africa roughly 200,000 years ago," said Prof Vanessa Hayes, a geneticist at the Garvan Institute of Medical Research in Australia. "What has been long debated is the exact location of this emergence and subsequent dispersal of our earliest ancestors." Prof Hayes' conclusions have drawn scepticism from other researchers in the field, however. Lakeland haven The area in question is south of the Zambezi basin, in northern Botswana. The researchers think our ancestors settled near Africa's huge lake system, known as Lake Makgadikgadi, which is now an area of sprawling salt flats. "It's an extremely large area, it would have been very wet, it would have been very lush," said Prof Hayes. "And it would have actually provided a suitable habitat for modern humans and wildlife to have lived." After staying there for 70,000 years, people began to move on. Shifts in rainfall across the region led to three waves of migration 130,000 and 110,000 years ago, driven by corridors of green fertile land opening up. The first migrants ventured north-east, followed by a second wave of migrants who travelled south-west and a third population remained in the homeland until today. This scenario is based on tracing back the human family tree using hundreds of samples of mitochondrial DNA (the scrap of DNA that passes down the maternal line from mother to child) from living Africans. By combining genetics with geology and climate computer model simulations, researchers were able to paint a picture of what the African continent might have been like 200,000 years ago. Reconstructing the human story However, the study, published in the journal Nature, was greeted with caution by one expert, who says you can't reconstruct the story of human origins from mitochondrial DNA alone. Other analyses have produced different answers with fossil discoveries hinting at an eastern African origin. Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum, London, who is not connected with the study, said the evolution of Homo sapiens was a complex process. "You can't use modern mitochondrial distributions on their own to reconstruct a single location for modern human origins," he told BBC News. "I think it's over-reaching the data because you're only looking at one tiny part of the genome so it cannot give you the whole story of our origins." Thus, there could have been many homelands, rather than one, which have yet to be pinned down. Evolutionary milestones in human history Follow Helen on Twitter.
While most students are happy with their course, dissatisfaction has grown since fees rose for English students, according to researchers for Which? and the Higher Education Policy Institute. The study highlights a big variation in teaching time, with students at some universities getting twice as much as those doing the same subject elsewhere. The BBC News website has gathered a range of viewpoints. Katharine Collins, second-year Childcare Studies student The course content has been very interesting, but I was expecting a little more one-to-one time with my tutors, a little more guidance. I probably get about 10 minutes a week one-to-one time with a tutor. I was one of the last students before the fees trebled, but at £3,000 a year, my course is still not cheap. I would like a bit more for my money really. We have lectures and seminars. Most of the time there are over 20 of us. So we need one-to-one tutor time to make sure we are getting on OK. We do about four assignments each term, each of about 3,000 words. Sometimes when they teach us generically it's not all that helpful. We're also supposed to be given written feedback after every assignment, but we had no feedback at all throughout the first year. We are given our grades about three weeks after we hand the assignments in - but this is just a percentage. There is no feedback on where we have gone wrong or how we might improve. Earlier this term we were suddenly handed back all our assignments from last year with things written on them. There were some errors, for example with referencing, that I kept making because no-one told me I was doing it wrong. I want to do postgraduate teacher training once I have finished my third year. I will go somewhere else to do that. I picked the course because of its reputation and because the prospectus indicated that we would be taught by published writers. There is a lack of one-to-one teaching. I would like personalised feedback from an expert in my field of writing. Some of the lectures have been quite helpful but they try to cater for too many different styles of writing - for instance if you want to be a poet you might find that the lectures focus too much on the novel. I think there is too much attention given to sharing our work in workshops and giving each other feedback. I think there should be more time given to actual teaching, rather than on feedback from people who are at a similar level to me. I don't think I am being taught enough of the craft. University should be more about learning. I could get similar feedback outside university if I got a group of writerly friends together and created a workshop in a local cafe. University was always something I was open to. Both my parents had gone to Newcastle and had loved it and I was certain that's where I wanted to go. When I started my A-levels, teachers started asking the inevitable questions: "Which course did I want to study?", "Which university?", "Had I set up my Ucas [Universities and Colleges Admissions Service registration] yet?" Tuition fees had just gone up and I was still struggling to find a course that I wanted to study. There were thousands to choose from and I was so confused. After I received my AS-level results, I still hadn't picked what I wanted to do and, although my grades were similar to many of my friends, I was disappointed with them and wasn't sure I wanted to go through endless retakes. Eventually, after really thinking it through, I realised university simply wasn't the right option for me. There was nothing I really wanted to study and to spend over £50,000 on a course I didn't love, seemed like a complete waste of money. Whenever I explain my decision to friends or family, they often reply with the same response, that I won't be paid as much as a graduate. The truth is, having done endless research, most companies and businesses value someone with work experience and ambition as much as they do a graduate. In fact if anything, I have the potential to be making more money than my friends once they leave university, and I won't have a huge debt to pay off. I set up Uni's Not For Me because I found there was so little advice and guidance for those trying to make a decision about university. Schools often don't mention alternatives to uni so it's drummed into students that university is the only acceptable route and often people feel like they're "failing" if they don't go. My ambition is that my site will provide awareness of all the options available, and tell the stories of people who have gone on to do amazing things and have very successful careers without a degree. The site is also aimed at teachers and parents to reassure them life can be perfectly OK if university is not part of the equation. What is clear from this, and other surveys, is that students are demanding more than ever from their universities, particularly with the increase in fees. With this, comes a need to ensure that prospective students, and often, parents, are getting all the right information about individual courses before they enrol. Universities have responded to this challenge and have worked hard to increase the amount of information on every course. New "key information sets" give prospective students standardised information for all undergraduate courses on things like fees, satisfaction rates for the course, course structure and employment prospects for graduates. While basic information about contact time for individual courses might be useful, attempts to rank courses at different institutions, based often on crude contact time samples, is not helpful or useful for prospective students. For example, it would be clear that a degree in a subject like history would place more emphasis on independent and guided research, whereas a lab-based subject would place a greater emphasis on direct, structured contact time with lecturers. The UK university system, one of the strongest in the world, is very diverse and complex and it is difficult to make these sorts of comparisons in such a broad way. And while there may be occasions when a student finds their course is not right for them, we must not forget that the vast majority of students are satisfied and satisfaction rates across all universities remain high. The important thing, if a problem occurs, is learning lessons. Universities are acting on responses to the National Student Survey on issues such as providing feedback to students. So does going to university represent value for money? Despite the difficult economic climate, graduates from UK universities remain highly valued by employers, here and overseas. Recent official figures confirmed that, on average, degree holders continue to earn considerably more than non-graduates over a working lifetime. The kinds of skills that higher education provides, the ability to think critically and to analyse and present evidence, are going to be increasingly in demand as our economy continues to shift. And let us not forget about all the other benefits such as mixing with people from all walks of life and corners of the globe, making life-long friendships, raising expectations and aspirations and developing a range of other skills along the way. It can be really life-changing. Ella, 16 When I work independently, I feel I have more freedom to develop my ideas and come up with more original viewpoints. The price of university will still be worth it to get the qualifications necessary for better jobs. Most of the people who disapprove of going to university have never tried university life so wouldn't know the benefits. Kieran, 16 If you want a job that needs a degree, then of course it is worth going to university. It's OK to do independent work, but the interaction of being able to ask your teacher what you are finding difficult would be lost. I like to be able to ask the teacher questions and have them help me to learn. It would affect my understanding of what I am learning and my overall achievements. Tyler, 16 Although the cost of university is very high now, I feel as though university is required for gaining a good, well paid job. People who tell me that university is not worth it, do make me think about the costs and other career options, however it does not change my opinion overall. Choosing your own way to learn could be very effective. (BBC School Report) Tripled tuition fees in England have done little more than replace slashed public funding for universities, so despite all that extra money paid by the students, universities have little scope to make genuine improvements to the student learning experience, and are struggling to keep pace with international competitors. The 2012-13 World University Rankings presented further evidence that many of our superb universities risk a slow slide into global mediocrity. The rankings showed some of the UK's most famous university names, Bristol, Sheffield, Leeds, Birmingham and Newcastle, sliding down the international league tables, while top universities in countries that are investing in their universities, especially in East Asia, continued a steady march up the rankings. As students in England increasingly begin to question the value for money they receive for their £9,000 tuition fees, other countries are willing and able to offer attractive alternatives. Strong campaigns to attract English students to more highly ranked institutions in the Netherlands, Germany, France and Canada have already seen some success. How long will it be until the steady trickle of British students deserting English universities for better and often cheaper options abroad turns into a flood? The rationale for surveying students in their first year is highly questionable and the findings take no account of the outcomes of the changing funding regimes to which universities have been subject to in the last seven years. When tuition fees were increased to £3,000 they were backed by state loans but the primary aim was to provide additional resources to universities. At the same time the government supported a national 'Aim Higher' access and outreach programme, restored maintenance grants to some students and provided institutions with additional funding to help with the costs of teaching part-time students. However, after the 2008 financial crisis there were some cuts to teaching funding which universities were required to manage. Fast forward to 2012 when fees were tripled, albeit also backed by a state loan, to cover a huge cut in university funding. The part-time institutional premium has also been abolished and universities are now required to use fee income to support a wide range of outreach programmes previously funded by government. In fact the survey confirms that students at modern universities are more likely to study in smaller groups and be taught by academics. There is no room for complacency but the fact remains that universities have done remarkably well to hold their own bearing in mind the funding roller coaster to which they and students have been subject in recent years. Government reforms are asking students to think more like consumers, while denying those who are dissatisfied any way of holding their institution to account. The information given to students and the way it is presented makes it very hard for students to make informed decisions, and universities are often far from transparent about the additional costs of studying. It is very difficult for a student to transfer from one institution to another, taking their course credits with them, and virtually impossible for a student to get a refund when they've been let down by an institution. The whole system of... tuition fees sets up unsavoury ideas about education as a financial transaction rather than a collaborative learning process that has value to students and society that extends way beyond the financial value of a degree certificate. The government needs to undo its shambolic changes to higher education and find a better way for graduates to contribute towards the education system, halting the marketisation of universities that is of no benefit to students or society.
Earlier the US national intelligence director's office said it was still investigating how the virus began. But the office said it had determined Covid-19 "was not manmade or genetically modified". China has rejected the lab theory and criticised the US response to Covid-19. Since emerging in China last year, the virus has killed 230,000 people worldwide including 63,000 in the US. The pandemic has seen at least 3.2 million people infected, a million of them Americans, since the virus spread from the city of Wuhan. What did Trump say? At the White House on Thursday, Mr Trump was asked by a reporter: "Have you seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was the origin of this virus?" "Yes, I have. Yes, I have," said the president, without specifying. "And I think the World Health Organization [WHO] should be ashamed of themselves because they're like the public relations agency for China." Asked later to clarify his comment, he said: "I can't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that." He also told reporters: "Whether they [China] made a mistake, or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one, or did somebody do something on purpose? "I don't understand how traffic, how people weren't allowed into the rest of China, but they were allowed into the rest of the world. That's a bad, that's a hard question for them to answer." Intelligence agencies have also been tasked with determining if China and the WHO withheld information about the virus early on, unnamed officials told NBC News. What did the intelligence service say? In a rare public statement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which oversees US spy agencies, said on Thursday it concurs with the "wide scientific consensus" regarding Covid-19's natural origins. "The [intelligence community] will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan." It was the first clear response from American intelligence debunking conspiracy theories - both from the US and China - that the virus is a bioweapon. What is the Wuhan lab? The Wuhan Institute of Virology, which was founded in the 1950s, houses China's first Biosafety Level 4 laboratory. Such labs handle the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments, and one of the areas the Wuhan facility studies is coronaviruses from bats. Designed and built with French help at a cost of $44m (£35m), the lab opened in 2015. Many of its staff were trained at a similar facility in the French city of Lyon, Nature journal reports. It is prestigious for China to have a Biosafety Level 4 lab with links to similar labs around the world. What are Trump's accusations against China? Mr Trump has recently been escalating his war of words with China over the pandemic after what officials within the US president's administration had described as a truce with Beijing. On Wednesday, he suggested China wanted him to lose his re-election bid in November. He has formerly accused Chinese officials of covering up the virus early on and saying they could have stopped the disease from spreading. He has similarly criticised the WHO and withdrawn US funding for the global body. China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, has accused the Trump administration of trying to distract from its own problems tackling the crisis. A ministry spokesman has also repeatedly promoted the idea - without evidence - that Covid-19 might have originated in the US. According to the Washington Post, the Trump administration is looking into ways to punish China financially. Discussions reportedly include allowing the US government to sue China for damages or cancelling debt obligations. How has Trump clashed with US intelligence before? In January, he called US intelligence agencies "naive" on Iran and dismissed their assessment of the threat posed by North Korea. His willingness to attack intelligence assessments goes back to his election in 2016, when he questioned an assessment that said Russia had interfered in the campaign. He has continued to defend Russia against the accusation that it ran a campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories to tip the vote in his favour despite US charges brought against Russian citizens. The right moment for this fight? President Trump's offensive against China is largely about domestic politics and his re-election campaign but it threatens to accentuate a developing Cold War mind-set towards Beijing which may well come to dominate diplomacy in the months and years ahead. Certainly there is much to criticise in China's handling of the initial stages of the Covid-19 outbreak and it has shamelessly sought to make political capital from the crisis. Even Mr Trump's Democratic opponent - Joe Biden - is doubling down on Beijing. But many analysts ask if this is the right moment to have this fight. China's rise has not gone as many in the West hoped. In its own region it is a military superpower - a match for the mighty United States. Its technological capabilities in strategic areas like 5G and artificial intelligence are impressive. And its wider influence - fostered through a single-minded effort to develop trade ties; financial relationships and so on - means that China is a force to be reckoned with, increasingly able to influence the international rules of the game. Countering Beijing's rising role will be the next US president's central foreign policy challenge, while also trying to find ways to work with China on issues like climate change.
China Daily and People's Daily call the House Intelligence Committee report "baseless"; Guangzhou's Southern Metropolis Daily says the two firms reacted "angrily" to the allegations. Shanghai's China Business News says it is the two parties' "favourite trick" to China-bash as the presidential race heats up. A People's Daily commentary rebukes the report as a "presumption of guilt". It says the report's statement that "the committee finds that the companies failed to provide evidence that would satisfy any fair and full investigation" reveals the committee's "gangster logic". The Global Times' bilingual editorial says: "We have to show through concrete actions that any unfair treatment to Chinese companies will be met by similar losses to American interests." Its Chinese version stresses the word "retaliation", saying China "must have the guts to struggle with the US" so that it will be respected. China Daily and People's Daily report comments by a senior Communist Party official on major corruption cases, including that of former Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai. "A series of major cases, including those involving [former Chongqing Party chief] Bo Xilai, [former railways minister] Liu Zhijun and [former Shenzhen mayor] Xu Zongheng were relentlessly pursued," the papers quoted He Guoqiang, secretary of the Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, as saying. He told a meeting the party had punished more than 660,000 officials for "disciplinary violations" in the past five years. Some 24,000 of them were handed over to law enforcement authorities for further investigation and prosecution. Hong Kong's South China Morning Post says Mr He, who became the party's anti-graft chief in 2007, is expected to step down after the 8 November party congress. The Global Times and People's Daily report Premier Wen Jiabao inspected anti-poverty work in southwest Guizhou province during the National Day holiday last week. He also urged continuous efforts on sustainable development in the region. Hong Kong's Sing Tao Daily says Mr Wen also showed off his basketball skills during the holiday in a friendly match between veteran national team players. Ming Pao Daily News says the lack of reports on Mr Wen's basketball match in state media indicates that Mr Wen is struggling to gain discursive authority ahead of the party congress. Shanghai Daily and the Beijing Times report a China Southern Airlines flight made an emergency landing on Monday after receiving a hoax threat of an attack. Flight CZ680, from Istanbul to Beijing, was forced to land in Lanzhou two hours after it resumed flight after a scheduled stop-over in Urumqi, capital of the restive Xinjiang region. Southern Metropolis Daily says a suspect has been detained by police in Xinjiang for the hoax. Papers including Shanghai Daily also report the announcement of this year's Nobel prize for medicine or physiology. The Global Times says Chinese netizens were "in angst" because one of the winners, Shinya Yamanaka, is Japanese.
The man says he is journalist John Cantlie and that he is a prisoner. Dressed in orange, Mr Cantlie, who in 2012 escaped an earlier kidnapping in Syria, asks why he and others have been abandoned by the US and UK governments. IS has recently killed three hostages and, in a video showing the death of UK aid worker David Haines, threatened to kill British man Alan Henning next. 'Unwinnable conflict' No IS militants are seen in the video, which is entitled "Lend Me Your Ears" and is addressed to the Western public. In it Mr Cantlie says other European governments have negotiated for the release of their hostages but says the US and UK have done things differently. "After two disastrous and hugely unpopular wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, why is it that our governments appear so keen to get involved in yet another unwinnable conflict?" he says. He also says this is the first of several of what he calls programmes in which he will explain the philosophy of IS. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said parts of it were like a "kind of parody of a chat show" and "very much a propaganda video". "It doesn't end with any overt threat. He's reading from a script, there's no knife or gun being held to his head," our correspondent said. He added that previous IS videos were directed at US and UK leaders, but this was meant for the British public, particularly Muslims. The message of the video is that IS has been "misrepresented by the Western media", and the hostage says he is going to be revealing the truth about IS in "the coming programmes", our correspondent added. From comments on the tape, it is clear it was made this year, but not precisely when. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg described IS as a "murderous, medieval, terrorist outfit". "We didn't need any reminding that what we're dealing with here in Isil is a movement of almost unprecedented barbarity and cynicism," said Mr Clegg, who has not yet seen the video. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he would "look very closely" at any material released on the internet. He said videos such as these could be "very distressing" to the families of the individuals involved. Who is John Cantlie? The video featuring Mr Cantlie has been released nearly a week after footage depicting the death of Mr Haines, the first British hostage to be killed. It was in that video that the life of Mr Henning, 47, from Salford, was threatened. Mr Henning was a volunteer on an aid convoy in December 2013 when he was seized just after crossing into Syria. Earlier, British Muslim leaders called for his immediate release, saying anyone undertaking a humanitarian act should be held in the highest esteem. The video of Mr Haines's death followed the killings of US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff - which were also shown in videos - in August and earlier this month respectively. On Tuesday, IS released a separate video, which was described by analysts as a video response to US air strikes. The slickly produced, Hollywood-style trailer for a film entitled "Flames of War" refers to US President Barack Obama's insistence that US combat troops would not be returning to fight in Iraq. In an apparent taunt, it depicts wounded US troops, masked executioners standing over kneeling captives, and declares at the conclusion: "Fighting has just begun."
