The man is said to have been trying to gather details about a German parliamentary committee that is investigating claims of US espionage. German authorities have asked the US ambassador for "swift clarification". The US National Security Agency (NSA) was last year accused of bugging the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel as part of a huge surveillance programme. The scale of the agency's global spy programme was revealed in documents leaked last year by a former intelligence contractor, Edward Snowden. The revelations about the NSA put a strain on ties between Germany and the US and raised feeling in Germany against American surveillance. The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin says the new allegation of American spying on an ally may make it harder for the US to get German help in its efforts to oppose Russian activity in Ukraine, and also to control Iranian nuclear ambitions. 'Serious matter' German media say the man arrested this week is a 31-year-old employee of the federal service, the BND or Bundesnachrichtendienst. The German federal prosecutor's office confirmed the man's arrest, but gave no other details. A spokesman for Ms Merkel said she had been informed of the arrest, as had the members of the nine-strong parliamentary committee investigating the activities of foreign intelligence agencies in Germany. "The matter is serious, it is clear," spokesman Steffen Seibert told the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper, Der Spiegel news magazine said the man was believed to have passed secret documents to a US contact in exchange for money. However, one unnamed politician told Reuters news agency the suspect had offered his services to the US voluntarily. "This was a man who had no direct contact with the investigative committee... He was not a top agent," the source said. Germany is particularly sensitive to reports of espionage on its territory because many of its citizens from the formerly communist east of the country were spied upon by the Stasi secret police.
By Judith BurnsBBC News education reporter The 1,000 Words Campaign stems from concerns that the country is losing out on international trade and jobs because of poor language skills. It aims to confront the view that only the brightest can learn a language. "For too long people from the UK have suffered from a reputation that we are lazy linguists" said supporter Vicky Gough of the British Council. "Speaking another language is crucial to understanding another culture", said Ms Gough. Multilingual world "So let's overturn our poor record in language learning and show that we are ready to engage with a multilingual world," she urged. The group say a vocabulary of 1,000 words would allow a speaker to hold a simple conversation. The challenge is part of Speak to the Future, a wider campaign backed by organisations including the British Council, the CBI, the British Academy and a range of embassies and language teaching bodies. This year's A-level results showed a continued fall in those taking French and German, down by 10% and 11% respectively - though Spanish bucked the trend with a 4% rise in entries. By contrast entries at GCSE for French, German and Spanish were up 16.9% on last year, reversing a long-term downward trend. This has been put down to the introduction of the EBacc, a league table measure of pupils who achieve GCSE grades A* to C in maths, English, two sciences, a foreign language and history or geography. However Teresa Tinsley of Speak to the Future told BBC News that because the EBacc is for pupils who achieve good grades, there is evidence that some schools are focusing their language teaching on more able students, whereas businesses need people with language skills at all levels of the workforce. "Top managers often have language skills but in fact staff whose jobs involve chasing invoices or buying stock abroad also need to speak another language", said Ms Tinsley. "A worrying divide is opening up". Campaign director Bernadette Holmes said: "The idea that everyone can learn the basics of another language is both realistic and attainable. "We are not expecting instant fluency. Yet if everyone were capable of at least 1,000 words in a new language, social attitudes and economic prospects would be significantly enhanced - young people would be better prepared for the challenges of globalisation and our cultural and intellectual levels would be raised. "I urge everyone in a position of influence to join the campaign and help us achieve this aim." Speak to the Future is funded by the British Academy and the university-based programme Routes into Languages.
He told the AFP news agency that their "shared life" had ended. Two weeks ago a magazine published photos which appeared to show Mr Hollande had been having an affair with an actress, Julie Gayet. Ms Trierweiler spent a week in hospital after the revelations. On Saturday evening she tweeted her thanks to the "wonderful staff" at the Elysee Palace. She said she "would never forget their devotion or the emotion at the time of departure". Mr Hollande, who has never denied having an affair with Julie Gayet, had admitted to a "difficult moment" in his relationship with Ms Trierweiler. At the time of the revelations, he promised to clarify the situation before his official visit to Washington on 11 February. Mr Hollande told AFP on Saturday that he was speaking in a personal capacity and not as the head of state. "I am making it known that I have put an end to my shared life with Valerie Trierweiler," he said in a phone call to the agency. Ms Trierweiler, who has continued to work as a journalist for the glossy magazine Paris-Match, is due to travel to India on Sunday in support of the work of the French charity Action Against Hunger. After leaving hospital, she stayed at an official presidential residence near Versailles, for a few days. Ms Trierweiler and Mr Hollande have never married. She announced their relationship six months after he left his previous partner, one-time French presidential candidate Segolene Royal, with whom he has four children. For her part, Ms Gayet has announced she is suing Closer magazine, which published the original reports, for breach of privacy. Closer magazine said that the affair had begun during the 2012 presidential race.
The MoD said the partnership could mean more intelligence is shared about the latest cyber threats. Defence companies face cyber-attacks almost daily, often from countries seeking to steal sensitive information about new technology and weapons. Officials say they hope the plan will serve as a model for other sectors. The new Defence Cyber Protection Partnership - a joint effort between the UK government and nine large defence companies - is designed to improve the industry's collective defences against cyber-attacks. It will also work to establish higher standards of security for smaller companies in the supply chain. Cyber-attacks are one of the top four threats to UK national security alongside international terrorism, according to the government's National Security Strategy. Earlier this month, UK intelligence service GCHQ said Britain was seeing about 70 sophisticated cyber-espionage operations a month against government or industry networks - some 15 of which were against the defence industry. GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban said business secrets were being stolen on an "industrial scale" and in some cases foreign hackers had penetrated firms for up to two years. In 2010 the British government designated the protection of computer networks as one of the country's most important national security priorities. It pledged £650m of new investment over the next four years to continue tackling the problem as part of its National Cyber Security Programme. In March, the government launched the Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership to help businesses and government share information on cyber threats, including a secure web portal to allow information to be shared in real-time.
The Harry Potter author was revealed as the writer of crime novel The Cuckoo's Calling in the Sunday Times. She found out the leak came from law firm Russells, whom she had assumed she "could expect total confidentiality from". "I feel very angry that my trust turned out to be misplaced. "To say that I am disappointed is an understatement," she said in a statement. "A tiny number of people knew my pseudonym and it has not been pleasant to wonder for days how a woman whom I had never heard of prior to Sunday night could have found out something that many of my oldest friends did not know," she added. Russells Solicitors said it apologised "unreservedly". In a statement, it said one of its partners, Chris Gossage, had told his wife's best friend, Judith Callegari, that Robert Galbraith was really Rowling. The company said it was revealed "during a private conversation" adding "the disclosure was made in confidence to someone he trusted implicitly". It has been reported Ms Callegari subsequently revealed Rowling's identity to a Sunday Times journalist via Twitter on 9 July. Russells continued: "Whilst accepting [Gossage's] own culpability, the disclosure was made in confidence to someone he trusted implicitly. On becoming aware of the circumstances, we immediately notified JK Rowling's agent." Marketing plan There had been speculation leaking the name was part of a publicity campaign. However Russells said: "We can confirm that this leak was not part of any marketing plan and that neither JK Rowling, her agent nor publishers were in any way involved." The Cuckoo's Calling - believed to be the debut novel of Galbraith - tells of war veteran-turned private investigator Cormoran Strike and received good reviews when it was first published. It had sold 1,500 copies before Rowling was revealed as the author, but within hours it rose more than 5,000 places to top Amazon's sales list. When she was revealed as Galbraith, Rowling said she had found writing under a pseudonym "a liberating experience". She issued a statement saying she had "hoped to keep this secret a little longer" but added it had "been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation, and pure pleasure to get feedback under a different name".
Damien Chazelle's movie is up for best musical or comedy film, while there are acting nominations for its stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Chazelle is up for best film director and it is also nominated for original screenplay, score and song. Coming-of-age drama Moonlight is close behind with six nominations, including best drama film. British actress Naomie Harris is up for best supporting actress for her role as a drug addict in the film. Manchester by the Sea, about a caretaker who finds himself taking in his teenage nephew, has five nods - best drama film, original screenplay, director for Kenneth Lonergan, actor for Casey Affleck and supporting actress for Michelle Williams. The other best drama actor nominees are Joel Edgerton for Loving, Andrew Garfield for Hacksaw Ridge, Viggo Mortensen for Captain Fantastic and Denzel Washington for Fences. Natalie Portman is favourite for the best drama actress award for playing Jacqueline Kennedy in the biopic Jackie. She will face competition from Arrival's Amy Adams, Jessica Chastain for Miss Sloane, Isabelle Huppert for Elle and Ruth Negga for Loving. World War II biopic Hacksaw Ridge, Texan family drama Hell or High Water and Indian/Australian coming-of-age movie Lion are also up for best drama film. BBC series The Night Manager has fared well in the TV categories, with nods for its British stars Olivia Colman, Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie. It is also up for best limited series. Analysis - Lizo Mzimba, BBC entertainment correspondent The Golden Globe nominations contained few real surprises and in many ways have confirmed, rather than changed the direction of this year's film awards race, which will culminate with the Oscars in February. Since it opened the Venice Film Festival in August, La La Land has been seen as the frontrunner for best film and best director at the Academy Awards, with its main rivals remaining Moonlight and Manchester by the Sea. Although the Golden Globes offers twice as many lead acting categories as the Baftas or the Oscars, today has done little to change the perception that Casey Affleck (Manchester by the Sea) and Emma Stone (La La Land) remain the favourites for the best actor and best actress Academy Awards. Perhaps most notable is the performance of Moonlight, with just one nomination fewer than La La Land. The Miami-set story of a young black man dealing with his sexuality now looks like the leading film to help end the race controversy of the last two years, with Mahershala Ali heavily tipped to win best supporting actor. And while Fences performed less strongly overall, Viola Davis is also thought likely to win best supporting actress. A welcome sign that after two years of #OscarsSoWhite, next year's Academy Awards nominations are likely to be more diverse - and on top of that the favourites to win in two of the acting categories are black. Olivia Colman faces fellow Brit Thandie Newton (Westworld) for best supporting actress in a limited TV series, as well as Game of Thrones star Lena Heady plus Chrissy Metz and Mandy Moore, who are both recognised for family comedy drama This Is Us. The Night Of's British star Riz Ahmed is nominated alongside Hiddleston for best actor in a limited TV series. They are up against Bryan Cranston for All the Way, John Turturro for for The Night Of and Courtney B Vance for American Crime Story: OJ Simpson v The People. American Crime Story: OJ Simpson v The People is also recognised, with acting nominations for John Travolta, Sterling K Brown and Sarah Paulson alongside Vance. The drama is also up for best limited series. In the movie categories, Disney's Zootopia and Moana are among those up for best animated feature film, alongside Kubo and the Strings, My Life as A Zucchini and Sing. Florence Foster Jenkins, based on the true story of a New York heiress who dreams of being an opera star, has four nominations, including a 30th Golden Globe nod for Meryl Streep and one for Hugh Grant. It is also up for best comedy or musical film alongside La La Land, 20th Century Woman, Deadpool and Irish film Sing Street, which was written and directed by Once film-maker John Carney. Other actors recognised in the musical/comedy category include Colin Farrell (The Lobster), Jonah Hill (War Dogs) and Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool). Alongside La La Land's Stone and Streep in best actress in a musical or comedy film category are Lily Collins (Rules Don't Apply), Hailee Steinfeld (The Edge of Seventeen) and Annette Bening (20th Century Women). Sully, starring Tom Hanks, was a notable omission from the list, as was with Martin Scorsese's Silence. The Golden Globes will be handed out in Los Angeles on 8 January at a ceremony hosted by Jimmy Fallon. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Members of the University and Colleges Union (UCU) are taking action in a row over pay, working conditions and pension cuts. The strikes will affect almost half of all UK universities. Staff at 60 universities are taking part in an eight-day walkout, BBC News has spoken to several students affected by the strike at the University of Bristol to get their views on their lecturers' actions. "It's good they're standing up for what they want and what they believe in but it's disruptive when it comes to our studies," said law postgraduate Soundraya Ravi, 23. "I had a seminar this afternoon that I was looking forward to and obviously we won't get that time back." Danny Shaw, 20, from Manchester, who is at Bristol studying English, said he was supporting the striking lecturers. "I think it's an excellent way to show their annoyance and anger at unfair working conditions, which I think have an undoubtedly knock-on effect for students," he said. "I think a lot of students might complain they're missing lectures - and they have essay deadlines coming up - but if staff can improve their teaching conditions that will have an effect on us and improve our education." Alice Keune, 20, from Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, said: "I think the strikes are completely fair enough if people are feeling unhappy and feeling they are being paid unjustly. "People absolutely have the right to strike and obviously it does interrupt our studies, but, I think in the long-run, a week's worth of lectures or seminars is completely fair enough for lecturers to take off." Law postgraduate Giselle Naimi, 25, from Canada, said she was "upset" for the tutors and staff who were being underpaid but "as an international student I am also paying for my education and it is quite disruptive. She added: "This happens at least once a year and it's time for administration to actually do something about it and negotiate properly with them so we can get the hours we deserve and they get the pay they deserve. "We have phenomenal teachers but we just need them to actually be there and be happy as well." Geography student Robbie Taylor, 22, from Hampshire, said he supported the strikes but added "it's the students who are most impacted by their actions". "I fully understand why they are doing it but I am not afraid to cross the picket line and go into university to use the facilities I paid to use," he said. Zethy Bintizainudin, 23, from Malaysia, is studying for a postgraduate degree in health, law and society at the University of Bristol. She said: "I think the strike should have been communicated better because I was refreshing my emails and did not get anything. "I am supporting my lecturers that are doing it because that's the purpose of it - to disrupt classes - and people are expressing their concerns that way. But as a student I'm paying the fees - and international students are paying double the fee."
By Becky BranfordBBC News Reuters obtained photocopies of the documents, in which a young Kim Jong-un is presented as "Josef Pwag" (son of Ricardo and Marcela) and his father as "Ijong Tchoi". A Brazilian security source told the news agency that the documents - which were issued by the Brazilian embassy in the Czech capital, Prague in 1996 - appeared to be genuine. Other security sources said the documents had been used to apply for visas to visit Western countries, but could not confirm whether the visas had been issued or used. But why would North Korea's ruling family need fake documents? And why Brazil? Did this really happen? These copies may not constitute conclusive proof, but it's not the first time Brazilian passports have been linked to the Kim family. In 2011, Japanese media quoted officials as saying Kim Jong-un and his brother Jong-chul had entered the country to visit Tokyo Disneyland on Brazilian documents as far back as 1991. Jong-un's older half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, is said to have fallen out of favour with their father in 2001 after he was caught trying to sneak into Japan using a false Dominican passport - apparently also on his way to Disneyland. Obtaining passports fraudulently doesn't seem to have been much of a problem for the Kims. But why would they need such passports? It was a cold world for North Korea in the 1990s. Its main backer, the Soviet Union, was now a fragment of history. Internally the country was being ravaged by shortages and famine, while internationally it was a pariah state - with billions of dollars of outstanding external debt. In the post-Cold War world of diplomacy, North Korea's friends were dwindling in number, making its passport of limited use. Its secretive first family would also probably have preferred to remain under the radar. Nonetheless, Dr John Nilsson-Wright, North Korea expert at UK security think-tank Chatham House, does find it surprising that Kim Jong-il - then only two years into his leadership - would have considered travelling abroad under a false passport. "Why would he want to do that? Kim Jong-il was seen as being very risk-averse - we know that he had visited Moscow and Beijing on a number of occasions, but for that he probably wouldn't have needed a passport," Dr Nilsson-Wright told the BBC's Newshour programme. "So it suggests that maybe this was an attempt by him and his son to think in terms of potentially an escape route out of North Korea - and that would be revealing and very surprising." It suggests, he says, "that there was a degree of uncertainty - that the country was less secure than we might have thought". But why a Brazilian passport - is it true to say it's the fraudsters' favourite? That's quite a common conception - that because of Brazil's diverse population, almost anyone on the planet could plausibly claim to be Brazilian and the passports are thus in high demand. A Brazilian official made such a claim to an al-Jazeera journalist in 2011. In fact, there isn't much data to suggest this assertion is currently valid. A survey by Vocativ in 2015 found Brazil did not feature in its list of the most expensive - and therefore most desirable - phoney passports available on the dark web (the criminal underbelly of the internet). Back in the 1990s, though, it was a different story. The Brazilian government itself concedes that before it introduced a raft of security features in 2006, the "Brazilian passport was one of the most commonly faked". The Kims could also easily pass as part of Brazil's large populations of East Asian origin. It's also interesting to note that the passport was issued in Brazil's embassy in the Czech Republic. Links - both economic and co-operative - were forged between North Korea and the then-Czechoslovakia during the period of frantic growth and rebuilding in North Korea following the devastating 1950-53 Korean War.
Mr Entwistle, who is currently director of BBC Vision, will take over from outgoing director general Mark Thompson on 17 September. Announcing the appointment outside BBC Broadcasting House, BBC Trust Chairman Lord Patten said: "George is a creative leader for a creative organisation." The BBC Trust said Mr Entwistle would be paid an annual salary of £450,000. It is a smaller figure than the £671,000 earned by Mr Thompson, bearing out Lord Patten's repeated assertion that the next head of the BBC would have a smaller salary than their predecessor. 'Privilege' In his current role - where he is paid £285,000 - Mr Entwistle oversees the division responsible for commissioning, producing, scheduling and broadcasting all of the BBC's TV content. "I'm delighted that the chairman and Trustees have decided I'm the right person for the job and I'm very excited about all that lies ahead," he said. "Mark Thompson will be a tough act to follow but it's a privilege to be asked to lead the greatest broadcasting organisation in the world." Mr Entwistle - who will be celebrating his 50th birthday this weekend - was selected by a panel at the BBC Trust, the governing body of the BBC, led by chairman Lord Patten. Speaking at a news conference announcing the appointment, Lord Patten said the Trust had "unanimously decided" to hire Mr Entwistle. "George had a lot of the attributes that we hoped a director general of the BBC would have," he said. "At the heart of them is the ability to give leadership to a great creative organisation. "While it's possible to do that if you haven't had a background in making programmes, there's greater credibility if you have, and he's got a great reputation as a cultural leader." Asked by the press whether the salary was higher than anticipated, Lord Patten said: "It's higher than some of you guessed but I can't help it if you guessed wrong. "It's actually less than anyone else in the sector... or what the heads of several newspapers are paid." 'Brilliant appointment' Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC's Media Show that Mr Enwistle faced two key challenges. "The first is how you make sure that the BBC maintains its position as the gold standard for quality in British and global broadcasting, whilst managing the licence fee settlement. "The second thing is coping with the technology revolution. By the time this director general ends his term of office, we will be in a totally different place as far as the broadcasting technology works, "I think that's been one of Mark Thompson's major achievements - with innovations like the iPlayer, the BBC has been a leader in technology. But I think that's going to be a very, very big challenge." Mr Thompson, who was rumoured to have singled out Mr Entwistle as his preferred candidate, said it was a "brilliant appointment". "George has shown himself to be an outstanding leader with an intuitive understanding of public sector broadcasting," he said. "He has a formidable track record as a programme maker and in recent years has also shown his calibre as a leader. "I wish him and the BBC every success in the years to come." Mr Thompson will stand down from his post after the Paralympics, having spent eight years in the role. He is the BBC's longest-serving director general since the 1970s. His tenure has seen the BBC suffer scandals including the Sachsgate affair, and controversy over the tone of the coverage of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee last month, in which Mr Entwistle also had a role. The corporation has also seen a series of budget cuts and staff redundancies in recent years. Yet Mr Thompson has also presided over successes including Strictly Come Dancing and Frozen Planet, and the launch of the BBC iPlayer. The new director general's first priority will be to prepare the BBC for the review of its Royal Charter. The current charter, which expires in 2016, sets out how the BBC should be funded, what it does and how it is managed.
Sir Tim Berners-Lee told the Guardian that the practice undermined efforts to fight cybercrime and cyberwarfare. He called for a "full and frank public debate" on internet surveillance. It comes as a parliamentary committee has quizzed the heads of the UK's spying agencies - GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 - together in public for the first time. Security weakened Sir Tim said the system of checks and balances to oversee GCHQ and its US counterpart the National Security Agency (NSA) had failed. Details about intelligence work carried out by the agencies and reported in the Guardian have been leaked by US whistle-blower Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor. Sir Tim said the agencies had weakened online security by cracking the encryption employed by internet users to protect their data privacy. He also said it was a betrayal of the technology industry. "Whistle-blowers, and responsible media outlets that work with them, play an important role in society," he said. "We need powerful agencies to combat criminal activity online - but any powerful agency needs checks and balances and, based on recent revelations, it seems the current system of checks and balances has failed," he said. Sir Tim said media coverage of the Snowden leaks "has been in the public interest and has uncovered many important issues which now need a full and frank public debate". Meanwhile a group of Conservative MPs has urged the Guardian to take responsibility for the security implications of reporting the information and "act accordingly". In their letter, 28 Tory MPs said publishing the leaks in such detail "runs the risk of compromising the vital work of the institutions, processes and people who protect the safety of this country". They asked the newspaper's editor, Alan Rusbridger, to discuss with the intelligence services the implications for national security that publication would have, and be explicit about any information they have released that could threaten the safety of intelligence services personnel. 'Significant step' Highlighting security risks that might occur if information intended for journalists fell into the hands of terrorists or "hostile foreign powers", the MPs also urged the paper to be open with the government and security agencies about exactly what information it had shared, and with whom. "We are asking you to do no more than to share with our intelligence services, the very people who protect the freedoms which the Guardian champions, that which you have already shared freely with international bloggers and journalists who have no concept of the UK national interest," they said. Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) has questioned GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban, MI5 director general Andrew Parker and MI6 chief Sir John Sawers. Mr Parker took over as head of the security service MI5 earlier this year. MI6 is charged with gathering intelligence and GCHQ with monitoring communications. Intelligence chiefs have given evidence to the committee in private for many years. The session was shown on the BBC News Channel, with a short time delay to prevent anything that might endanger national security or the safety of those working for the agencies being broadcast. The ISC, made up of senior MPs and peers, said the committee meeting was "a very significant step forward in terms of the openness and transparency of the agencies".
He said eurozone rates would "stay at present or lower levels for an extended period" and there would be "no limits" to action to reflate the eurozone. His comments followed the ECB's regular meeting, where it kept the bank's benchmark rate unchanged at 0.05%. The overnight deposit rate was also left unchanged at -0.3%. At the ECB meeting in December, this rate had been cut from -0.2% in an attempt to push banks to lend instead of parking money at the ECB. In December, the ECB had also extended its €60bn-a-month stimulus programme by six months to March 2017. Eurozone inflation is currently running at 0.2%, way below the ECB's target of near 2%. "We have the power, willingness and determination to act. There are no limits how far we are willing to deploy our policy instruments," Mr Draghi said. Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight, said "the stimulus trigger looks cocked and ready to pull as soon as the March ECB meeting". 'Risks' Mr Draghi told a news conference: "As we start the new year, downside risks have increased again amid heightened uncertainty about emerging market economies' growth prospects, volatility in financial and commodity markets and geopolitical risks." He said that could make it necessary to review - and possibly reconsider - monetary policy at the next meeting in early March. Analysis: Andrew Walker, economics correspondent, in Frankfurt Mario Draghi most definitely doesn't do panic. In fact, his demeanour in the news conference after the ECB's governing council meeting didn't even suggest mild anxiety. Still, his words made it plain that he and his policy-making colleagues have been watching the new year's financial market gyrations very warily. It's not the ECB's job to stabilise stock markets. The Bank's job is to keep inflation in check, but it is currently too low: 0.2% compared with the ECB's target of below, but close to, 2%. The financial market turbulence, especially the fall in oil prices is one reason why, as Mr Draghi said, "inflation dynamics continue to be weaker than expected". He told us the ECB will review policy at its next meeting in March. There is a strong chance of more action, probably extra quantitative easing, to stimulate inflation a bit more (yes really). That meeting will have a new set of ECB macroeconomic projections to work with. He said that the recent falls in the oil price meant that inflation was likely to be "significantly lower" compared with the outlook in early December. Eurozone inflation was below zero - that is, prices were falling - as recently as September, mainly due to falls in international energy prices, particularly crude oil. In December, Mr Draghi said that eurozone inflation was expected to reach 1% in 2016. However, the ECB's forecasts were based on the assumption of oil prices averaging more than $50 a barrel this year, and oil is currently below $30. Market reaction Mr Draghi's latest comments were seen as helping to calm stock markets, with shares in Europe rising as his news conference was under way. His comments also weakened the euro, which briefly fell below $1.08 against the dollar before regaining ground. "ECB president Draghi once again saw the equity markets confirm his 'super' status as they jumped almost as soon as he started his speech," said Alastair McCaig, market analyst at IG. "The emphasis shifted from 'whatever it takes' to 'no limits' where action is concerned, with the small caveat that nothing will happen until they have had their March meeting."
By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent Andrew Hamilton told a university gathering the real cost of an Oxford undergraduate course was £16,000. He asked how a "market" in higher education could operate if everything "regardless of content and quality, is the same price". The university faced an annual funding gap of £70m, said Prof Hamilton. He argued that different types of institutions should be able to charge different levels of fees. Funding shortfall "Given the great diversity of the institutions in our higher education system, the notion of different universities charging significantly different amounts, doesn't feel inherently unnatural. "It is the current situation that seems out of kilter. What matters surely is that an institution's charges are clearly aligned with what it offers and that they are demonstrably not a barrier to student access." A university spokesman said that the speech was not proposing that students would have to pay fees of £16,000 per year to bridge the shortfall. But Prof Hamilton suggested a "system of tuition charges more closely related to the true cost", with the "strongest guarantees" of support for poorer students. Prof Hamilton argued that there needed to be a more sustainable funding model for universities where £9,000 did not cover their costs. He had heard that some universities were "doing very nicely thank you" with fees of £9,000. "That may or may not be the case for them, but one thing I am quite sure about is that it doesn't add up for Oxford, where the new regime of increased tuition charges for students, but greatly reduced government spending on teaching, have done little to change the basic financial equation." Along with ideas such as increasing philanthropic donations, he floated the idea of raising funds through issuing bonds to investors. The raising of tuition fees to £9,000 was a highly controversial measure, prompting violent protests and occupations, in the biggest upsurge of student activism for decades. Academics at the University of Oxford passed a symbolic motion of no confidence in Universities Minister David Willetts and his higher education funding reforms. But with the funding changes in place, the speech on Tuesday by Prof Hamilton shows there are still far-reaching financial questions for such leading institutions. How can they compete on an international stage with better-funded rivals? Harvard University's financial figures, released last month, showed the US university has an endowment that has grown to $32.7bn (£20.3bn). A fundraising drive by Harvard, launched last month, aims to raise an additional $6.5bn (£4bn). Last year, Oxford hailed the donation of £75m as "the largest such benefaction for undergraduate financial support in European university history". Responding to the speech, Sally Hunt, general secretary of the UCU lecturers' union said: "Prof Hamilton should perhaps be applauded for going after one of the rawest nerves in politics to try and get higher education funding back in the spotlight - something we fear no party will be keen to do this side of the general election. "However, higher university fees are not what this country needs. "Prof Hamilton is correct to say our universities need more funding - we invest just 1.4% of GDP on higher education, compared to an international average of 1.7%. "However, he is wrong to argue that students should pick up tab when we already have the most expensive fees in Europe."
The skull was a male Paranthropus robustus, a "cousin species" to Homo erectus - a species thought to be direct ancestors of modern humans. The two species lived around the same time, but Paranthropus robustus died out earlier. The research team described the find as exciting. "Most of the fossil record is just a single tooth here and there so to have something like this is very rare, very lucky," Dr Angeline Leece told the BBC. The researchers, from Melbourne's La Trobe University, found the skull's fragments in 2018 at the Drimolen archaeological site north of Johannesburg. It was uncovered just metres away from a spot where a similarly aged Homo erectus skull of a child was discovered in 2015. Archaeologists then spent the past few years piecing together and analysing the fossil. Their findings were published in the Nature, Ecology and Evolution journal on Tuesday. Co-researcher Jesse Martin told the BBC that handling the fossil pieces was like working with "wet cardboard", adding he had used plastic straws to suck the last traces of dirt off them. 'Competing species' It is thought that three hominins (human-like creatures) species lived in South Africa at the same time in competition with each other. As such the skull discovery presented a rare example of "microevolution" within human lineage, Mr Martin said. Paranthropus robustus had large teeth and small brains, differing from Homo erectus which had large brains and small teeth. It is believed the former's diet involved eating mainly tough plants, like tubers and bark. "Through time, Paranthropus robustus likely evolved to generate and withstand higher forces produced during biting and chewing food that was hard or mechanically challenging to process with their jaws and teeth," said Dr Leece. The scientists said it was possible that a wetter environment caused by climate change may have reduced the food available to them. Meanwhile Homo erectus, with their smaller teeth, was more likely to have eaten both plants and meat. "These two vastly different species... represent divergent evolutionary experiments," Dr Leece said. "While we were the lineage that won out in the end, two million years ago the fossil record suggests that Paranthropus robustus was much more common than Homo erectus on the landscape."
Rescue missions and aid material have started arriving in the country. Seventeen people have been killed on Mt Everest by avalanches - the mountain's worst-ever disaster. Meanwhile a powerful aftershock was felt on Sunday in Nepal, India and Bangladesh, and more avalanches were reported near Everest. The 6.7-magnitude tremor, centred 60km (40 miles) east of Nepal's capital Kathmandu, sent people running in panic for open ground in the city. At the scene: By Surendra Phuyal, BBC News, Kathmandu As military helicopters hovered over Kathmandu and ferried relief supplies to victims of the earthquake in western Nepal, search and rescue efforts were going on in at least five locations in Kathmandu. Near the prime minister's official residence, two bulldozers scoured the rubble of a flattened four-storey house. A bystander said it was the local tax office. The bodies of the four staff inside had been recovered minutes before. As the search and road-clearing efforts got under way at noon, a major aftershock sent people into a panic again. At a nearby open space, people were camped out fearing further tremors. They were short of food and water - clearly hoping and praying that the aftershocks would stop and things would be normal soon. The death toll from the original earthquake on Saturday could rise, as the situation is unclear in remote areas which remain cut off or hard to access. Many mountain roads are cracked or blocked by landslides. Scores of bodies have been ferried to hospitals in Kathmandu, many of which are struggling to cope with the number of injured. More than 700 have died in the capital alone. Tents have been set up in a parade ground in the city centre to house thousands of people displaced by the earthquake. Medics are expecting a fresh influx of patients on Sunday as supplies run low. Rescuers used their bare hands in places to dig for survivors still buried underneath piles of rubble and debris overnight on Saturday. Army officer Santosh Nepal told the Reuters news agency that he and his soldiers had to dig a passage into a collapsed three-storey residential building in Kathmandu using pickaxes because bulldozers could not get through the ancient city's narrow streets. "We believe there are still people trapped inside," he told Reuters. The 7.8-magnitude quake struck an area of central Nepal between Kathmandu and the city of Pokhara on Saturday morning. There were also victims in India, Bangladesh and in the Chinese region of Tibet. It is the worst earthquake in Nepal since 1934, when some 8,500 people were killed. Analysis - BBC Science correspondent Jonathan Amos Large quakes are generally followed by a flurry of aftershocks, which tend to reduce in strength and frequency as time goes on. As a rule of thumb, seismologists might expect to see at least one aftershock that measures roughly a magnitude less than the main shock. One of these, with a Magnitude of 6.6, was seen just half an hour after Saturday's main 7.8 event. Sunday has now experienced a further big aftershock of 6.7. From the early data, the tremor looks to have originated closer to the surface than Saturday's big shakers. Although each step down on the magnitude scale is a 30-times drop in the energy released, Sunday's big aftershock will not have felt like that for those on the ground. And, of course, it may have toppled many already severely damaged buildings, adding to the difficulties of the rescue operation. Nepal's architectural jewels destroyed Why Nepal is so vulnerable to quakes Challenges of Nepal's quake relief operation 'Moment of crisis' "We have launched a massive rescue and rehabilitation action plan and lots needs to be done," Information and Broadcasting Minister Minendra Rijal told Indian television. "Our country is in a moment of crisis and we will require tremendous support and aid." . Scores of people slept outside on Saturday night - braving wet and cold weather - either because their homes were destroyed or because they feared numerous aftershocks. World leaders and global charities have offered emergency aid to Nepal, as the government grapples with the scale of the disaster. India is at the forefront of the relief effort, offering help including helicopters which have been deployed to remote areas. The United States, Britain, China, Pakistan and European Union countries are among those who have pledged aid. A number of international charities including Red Cross, Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders and Christian Aid are also sending teams to quake-hit areas. The International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it was especially worried about the fate of villages near the epicentre of the quake, some 80km (50 miles) from Kathmandu. 'Rubble and landslides' The problems have been compounded by erratic internet and mobile phone communications. British Red Cross spokeswoman Penny Sims said it was hard to get an accurate picture of what is going on. "A lot of the roads are blocked, there's rubble, there's been landslides as well... So that is going to make the aid effort very difficult," she told the BBC. Foreign climbers and their Nepalese guides around Mt Everest were caught by the tremors and a huge avalanche. As well as the 17 confirmed deaths, 61 people were injured when part of the base camp was buried under snow. Helicopters trying to airlift the injured to Kathmandu were delayed by cloudy weather, but have now managed to rescue most of them. Dan Fredinburg, a Google executive who described himself as an adventurer, was among the dead, Google confirmed. Are you in the area? Are you affected by the earthquake?

By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Experts estimate the toll includes thousands of Britons each year. The British Heart Foundation, which funded The Lancet work, says the UK must clean up its air - many of its cities often exceed safe levels set by the European Union. The government has already admitted that in 15 regions, air quality will breach EU limits until 2020. But Defra says it is committed to improving air quality and that most parts of the UK meet EU air quality limits for all pollutants. Air pollution, largely from traffic fumes, has previously been linked to heart attacks but not heart failure. This happens when the heart muscle becomes weak and less good at its job of pumping blood around the body. It is often the consequence of a heart attack and affects more than 750,000 people in the UK. Deep into lungs The Lancet research looked at 35 studies with data for thousands of patients in 12 countries, including the UK, the US and China. The strongest link was found with gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, as well as fine particulate air pollution - fumes from buses, taxis and lorries that can get deep into the lungs and, from there, into the bloodstream. People with already weakened hearts who were exposed to high levels, by living near to or travelling along busy roads, for example, were particularly susceptible. And the increased risk seems to be strongest on the day of exposure. Dr Anoop Shah and colleagues who carried out the work say moderate reductions in air pollution could avoid 8,000 US hospital admissions for heart failure each year. "There's no reason why the impact wouldn't be similar in the UK." Alan Andrews of the lobby group Client Earth said: "The UK has a big problem with air pollution, particularly from road traffic, and the government response sadly has been worse than useless." He said people should be alerted when pollution levels are high so that they can take measures to protect themselves, by staying indoors when possible and avoiding busy roads. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution in towns and cities kills 1.3 million people globally each year. UK estimates suggest nearly 30,000 people die prematurely each year as a direct result of exposure to air pollution. Air pollution has been linked to asthma and other lung diseases, including cancer, as well as heart problems. The Chief Medical Officer recently highlighted the impact of air pollution in her first annual report on the state of the nation's health - air pollution was highlighted among the top 10 causes of mortality in the UK.
Writing in The Observer, its boss Anthony Browne also says smaller banks could move operations overseas by 2017. "Their hands are quivering over the relocate button," he wrote. Most banks had backed the UK remaining in the EU. Mr Browne also said the current "public and political debate at the moment is taking us in the wrong direction." His comments build upon those he made at the BBA annual conference last week, when he said banks had already "set up project teams to work out what operations they need to move by when, and how best to do it". 'Legal right' "Banking is probably more affected by Brexit than any other sector of the economy, both in the degree of impact and the scale of the implications," he told the newspaper. "It is the UK's biggest export industry by far and is more internationally mobile than most. But it also gets its rules and legal rights to serve its customers cross-border from the EU." Analysis: Joe Lynam, BBC Business correspondent One of the perks of Europe's Single Market - which also currently includes the UK, Norway and EU countries such as the Netherlands - is "passporting". Passporting allows banks and insurance companies to sell their services anywhere in the single market without having to establish a base in every country in Europe. But single market membership comes with conditions: freedom of movement of goods, services, capital and (crucially) people. Theresa May has already said she intends to restrict the free movement of people from the EU after Brexit, while EU leaders have meanwhile said the four freedoms are indivisible ie non-negotiable. That means the UK may have to quit the single market and lose passporting. What Anthony Browne from the BBA is doing is upping the ante on the government, by saying some banks will start to relocate in the coming months without passporting. What he also says though is that erecting any barriers to cross-border banking will be just as bad for Europe as it would be for the UK. Mr Browne added: "For banks, Brexit does not simply mean additional tariffs being imposed on trade - as is likely to be the case with other sectors. It is about whether banks have the legal right to provide services." Banks want to see the continuation of the EU's "passporting" system, allowing UK-based financial services to operate across Europe without needing separate authorisation. 'Split in two' Banks have called for transition arrangements to be put in place after the UK leaves the EU. But Mr Browne warned that in Europe and among UK eurosceptics the mood was "hardening". "The problem comes - as seems increasingly likely, judging by the rhetoric - when national governments try to use the EU exit negotiations to build walls across the Channel to split Europe's integrated financial market in two, in order to force jobs from London," Mr Browne said. "From a European perspective, this would be cutting off its nose to spite its face. It might lead to a few jobs moving to Paris or Frankfurt but it will make it more expensive for companies in France and Germany to raise money for investment, slowing the wider economy." Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Tom Brake said that if the UK pursued a "hard Brexit" then it would "threaten the £65bn the UK financial services industry pays in taxes each year". He added: "The Conservative government must explain how it will make up this funding shortfall if the UK leaves the single market."
By Smitha MundasadHealth reporter, BBC News Scientists found young people who spent less than an hour a day engaged in video games were better adjusted than those who did not play at all. But children who used consoles for more than three hours reported lower satisfaction with their lives overall. The research is published in the journal Pediatrics. Experimental psychologist Dr Andrew Przybylski analysed British surveys involving 5,000 young people aged 10 to 15 years old. Social interactions Some 75% of those questioned said they played video games daily. Children were asked to quantify how much time they spent gaming on a typical school day - using consoles or computers. They then rated a number of factors, including: The answers were combined to assess levels of psychological and social adjustment. When compared with all other groups, including those who played no video games at all, young people reporting under an hour of play each day were most likely to say they were satisfied with their lives and showed the highest levels of positive social interactions. The group also had fewer problems with emotional issues and lower levels of hyperactivity. According to the results, people who spent more than three hours playing games were the least well adjusted. 'Digital world' Dr Przybylski says there may be numerous reasons behind this. He told the BBC: "In a research environment that is often polarised between those who believe games have an extremely beneficial role and those who link them to violent acts, this research could provide a new, more nuanced standpoint. "Being engaged in video games may give children a common language. "And for someone who is not part of this conversation, this might end up cutting the young person off." He argues that policies and guidelines that impose limits on the use of this technology need to take such evidence into account. Dr Przybylski points out that though the effect of video games on children is statistically significant in this study, factors such as the strength of family relationships play a larger role. Dr Iroise Dumontheil, of Birkbeck, University of London, who was not involved in the research, said: "Other studies have shown that playing first-person shooter games, but not other types, can lead to increased visuospatial processing and memory abilities. "Further research would help to determine whether particular types of game help or hinder adolescents as they adjust to the changes they experience during development."
Until now, Saudi visas were only really granted to expatriate workers, people visiting on business, and pilgrims visiting either or both of the two holy cities Mecca and Medina. The kingdom has also pledged to relax its strict dress codes for female visitors, and to allow women to travel to the country unaccompanied. This is all part of the kingdom's push for economic reform, in order to decrease its dependence on oil - but it is also an attempt to rebrand itself amid criticism of its human rights record, including last year's murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and crackdowns on women's rights activists. There are also some caveats. Women will still need to dress modestly in public, and non-Muslims will still be forbidden from visiting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. So what can Saudi's new tourists expect to see? Al Wahbah volcanic crater In the middle of the desert, some 250 km (155 miles) away from the city of Taif, is Al Wahbah - a large volcanic crater with a salt field in its centre. Al Wahbah has become popular with hikers in recent years, although it is a challenge. As the crater is 820 ft deep, it takes competent hikers about two to three hours to get down to the bottom and back up again. For those hoping for something a bit less active, it is also a popular camping spot. The ancient city of Mada'in Saleh Mada'in Saleh was the second largest city of the Nabateans, a group of people who settled across ancient Arabia and the Jordan Valley until their empire was annexed by the Romans in 106 CE. Now, among the ruins are a vast necropolis with 130 tombs, small pre-Islamic altars, and some adobe houses - structures made from earth - in what used to be the city's living quarters. Mada'in Saleh was designated a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2008 - the first site in Saudi Arabia to get this accolade. Historic Jeddah and the Gate to Mecca Another Unesco World Heritage Site is the Gate to Mecca, located in Historic Jeddah. In the 7th Century CE, Jeddah was established as both a major port for Indian Ocean trade routes, and the entry point for Muslim pilgrims who arrived by sea on their way to the religious city of Mecca. Masmak Fortress in Riyadh Masmak Fortress in the Saudi capital Riyadh was first built in about 1865 - but it is most well known for what happened 37 years later. In 1902, the exiled royal, Abdulaziz bin Abdul Rahman bin Faisal Al Saud, returned to his ancestral hometown Riyadh and seized this fortress. Based at Masmak, he went on to conquer the different kingdoms of the region, before eventually uniting them to form what is now the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. King Fahd's Fountain King Fahd's Fountain in Jeddah is said to be the tallest fountain in the world. Conservative estimates say the fountain, which was donated to the city by the late King Fahd, can shoot saltwater up to 853 ft (260 metres) high - although some estimates put this closer to 1,000 ft. At night, it is lit up by more than 500 spotlights. Umluj - aka the Saudi Maldives The sandy beaches of Umluj - often referred to as the Saudi Maldives - are on the country's Red Sea coast. From the beach you can see mountains and inactive volcanoes, while there are mango farms nearby. Neolithic art of Jubbah and Shuwaymis According to Unesco there was once a lake near these rock formations, which made it an important gathering spot for humans and animals. While here our Neolithic ancestors left their mark, in the form of these drawings on the rock faces of Jubbah and Shuwaymis. What is it like to visit Saudi Arabia? James Merriman - from Barnstaple, England - visited Riyadh in 2014 on a three-day transit visa. "I visited Masmak Fortress, part of old Riyadh. Inside is a small museum which includes photos of old Riyadh from the early 20th century. Nearby is Deira Square which is the main public square of the city. It does, however, have a more sinister use for the location where public executions are carried out, hence it's nickname 'chop-chop square'. "Modern Riyadh is all about grand shopping malls and large skyscrapers situated on the grand King Fahd Road. The Kingdom Center is the largest (the building with a gap at the top like a bottle opener). Tourists can visit the observation desk at the top for impressive views over the city. "The best views of Riyadh at night are from the nearby Faisaliah Tower. From the top you are treated to a lovely view of the Kingdom Center tower lit up in different colours. But as it's an open-deck viewing platform it's very windy! "For those wanting to try local cuisine, the locals like to eat camel meat. I would describe it similar to mutton but greasier. I preferred the excellent local dates and the refreshing non-alcoholic malt drinks." All pictures copyright
"We've been talking to Robbie about it," Howard Donald told The Sun. "It might be that if we do a 25th anniversary album, that we do some co-writing or some extra tracks on that." "In our minds at the moment there's an intention to do some new tracks, a greatest hits [album] and a tour," said bandmate Mark Owen, who said "it would be nice to do something with" Williams. But Owen said it was unlikely former member Jason Orange could be enticed back to the chart-topping band after leaving in 2014. "I think Jay is happy where he is," said the 44-year-old, who currently makes up Take That with Donald, 48, and Gary Barlow, 45. "I don't think at the moment he has any sort of dreams or wishes to come back and do it, so we're just carrying on doing our thing." Donald added: "Jason is in his place where he is now and he's not got any intention at the moment to be back in the band." Take That formed in 1990 and had their first top 10 hit two years later with their cover version of It Only Takes a Minute. They split in 1996 but reformed in 2006 for a reunion tour, which led to new albums. Williams, 42, left the group in 1995 but rejoined briefly in 2010 for the band's Progress album and tour. Last week it was announced Barlow will front a Saturday night BBC One show leading a talent search for the cast of a Take That musical. Let it Shine, co-presented by Graham Norton and Mel Giedroyc, will search for a band to take part in a stage show featuring the group's music.
It won every award it was nominated for - including best musical or comedy film, best director, screenplay, score and song. Its stars Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling also won in the acting categories. The Globes are seen as pointers to the Oscars. Moonlight was named best drama film, while Casey Affleck and Isabelle Huppert won other acting prizes. British actors also enjoyed a golden night in the TV categories, with prizes for The Night Manager and The Crown. Affleck was named best actor in a film drama for his role in Manchester By The Sea and French star Huppert was the surprise winner of the award for best film drama actress. Her performance in thriller Elle - which was also named best foreign language film - beat contenders including Natalie Portman, who had been considered the favourite for playing Jackie Kennedy in Jackie. Viola Davis was named best supporting film actress for playing a woman in 1950s Pittsburgh in Fences - a role she first played on Broadway six years ago. The movie is an adaptation of the August Wilson play, which explores race relations in post-war America. Accepting the award, Davis said: "It's not every day that Hollywood thinks of translating a play to screen - it doesn't scream 'moneymaker'. But it does scream art, and it does scream heart." In a surprise result, British actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson was named best supporting actor for his role in Nocturnal Animals - a prize that had been widely expected to go to Mahershala Ali for Moonlight. Zootopia was named best animated feature film at Sunday's ceremony, which was hosted by Jimmy Fallon. The comedian's opening monologue was less risque than those of some of his predecessors, but he still found time to make light of the divisive year in US politics. The talk show host joked that the Golden Globes ceremony was "one of the few places left where America still honours the popular vote" - a reference to Donald Trump beating Hillary Clinton in the recent US election despite getting fewer votes overall. He also described grief-stricken film Manchester By The Sea as "the only thing more depressing than 2016". The ceremony featured several references to Mr Trump - not least when Meryl Streep launched an attack on the US President-elect while accepting the Cecil B Demille award for outstanding contribution to entertainment. Streep referred to Trump's mocking of a disabled reporter and said: "Disrespect invites disrespect, violence incites violence. And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose." There were several British triumphs in the television categories, including wins for Tom Hiddleston, Hugh Laurie and Olivia Colman for The Night Manager. Claire Foy also won best actress in a television series for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix's The Crown. The Golden Globe Awards, which are run by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, honour the best in TV and film from the past year.

The pyramid-shaped building has become known as the "Hotel of Doom". The chief executive of the Kempinski group, which will manage the Ryugyong hotel, said only 150 rooms on the top floors would be used as a hotel. Reto Wittwer said shops, restaurants and offices would eventually open on the lower levels. Construction on the building began in 1987. It is the 47th tallest building in the world, at 330m (1,100ft), and has the fifth greatest number of floors, 105. Abandoned It was scheduled to be completed in 1989 in time for the 13th World Festival of Youth and Students. But construction was abandoned in 1992 when North Korea suffered an economic crisis. Its hulking, unfinished presence has long been an embarrassment for the North Korean leadership, analysts say. It was voted "Worst Building in the History of Mankind" by Esquire magazine in 2008. The American publication called it "hideously ugly, even by communist standards." There are reports of poor construction and the use of inferior materials. A delegation from the European Union Chamber of Commerce in Korea, which inspected the building almost 15 years ago, concluded it was beyond repair and its lift shafts crooked. But in 2008 an Egyptian company, Orascom Telecom, which operates a mobile phone network in North Korea, began equipping the building. 'Multi-storey carpark' It is reported to have spent $180m (£112m) on finishing the hotel's facade. Mr Wittwer said the hotel will "partially, probably" open for business next year. But original plans for 3,000 hotel rooms and three revolving restaurants have been greatly scaled back. Earlier this year, the Beijing-based company, Koryo Tours, which organises trips to North Korea, was granted a rare glimpse inside the hotel. Photos taken by the company showed a vast glass-covered lobby and atrium with tiers of bare concrete at its base, resembling a multi-storey car park.
Michael and Emily Eavis issued a joint statement confirming all 120,000 remaining tickets had been sold in just one hour and 27 minutes. They said they were "blown away" by the numbers logging on and were "genuinely sorry" that so many had missed out. Ticketing website See Tickets had earlier apologised to customers on Twitter for "technical difficulties". The site, which had been managing the sale of tickets for Glastonbury, wrote that the issues had led to "a very difficult half an hour" before the site stabilised, later adding that it was selling 3,000 tickets a minute. Prices for the 2014 event had been increased by £10 to £210, plus a booking fee, but festival-goers could pay a deposit of £50 before settling their bill in April. For the first time, coach packages were available three days earlier, with all 15,000 tickets selling out in half an hour. A statement by the father and daughter Eavis team, Michael and Emily, was posted on the festival's own Twitter feed, saying: "We genuinely try to make the ticket system as fair as it can be, but when demand outstrips supply, it is an unfortunate inevitability that some people will be left disappointed." They went on to thank people for their "incredible support", adding: "We really don't take it for granted and we are exceedingly fortunate to have that loyalty." No acts have yet been confirmed to play at the festival at Worthy Farm between 26 and 29 June next year, but there is already speculation about who will headline. David Bowie is one of the bookies' favourites, with other rumours including Foo Fighters and Fleetwood Mac. This year saw Arctic Monkeys, Rolling Stones and Mumford and Sons top the bill on the festival's famous Pyramid Stage.
The former army captain won 55.2% of the vote against 44.8% for Fernando Haddad of the left-wing Workers' Party. Mr Bolsonaro's pledge to fight crime and corruption following a string of scandals have won him mass support. However critics are worried by his praise of Brazil's former dictatorship, and by his comments on race, women and homosexuality. In one infamous incident in 2015 he told a fellow lawmaker she was too ugly to rape. Mr Bolsonaro's controversial comments, his pro-gun stance and his populist approach to politics have led to some media dubbing him "Trump of the Tropics". President Trump himself took to Twitter on Monday to praise the Brazilian president-elect. For his supporters, Mr Bolsonaro is a politician who they say will bring much needed change to the country - a swing to the right after four elections won by the left. For the past four years, Brazil has been consumed by a criminal investigation - known as Operation Car Wash - that has uncovered massive corruption. Dozens of business and political leaders have been jailed. Among them was former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who was barred from standing in the election. Read more: How did the result break down? Who is Bolsonaro and what is he likely to do in office? The 63-year-old leads the Social Liberal Party (PSL), an anti-establishment group that combines social conservatism and pro-market policies. Mr Bolsonaro is a deeply polarising figure who has had a divisive effect on Brazilians with both supporters and opponents taking to the streets to make their voices heard. He has in the past defended the killing of opponents to the country's former military regime and said he is "in favour of dictatorship". But after the results came in, he told supporters he would be a "defender of democracy" and uphold the constitution. One of his flagship policies is to restore security by relaxing gun laws and suggested that "every honest citizens" should be able to own a gun. He has promised to reduce state intervention in the economy and indicated that Brazil could pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. He takes over on 1 January 2019. Messy future Analysis by BBC's Katy Watson in Sao Paulo Is there a chance Mr Bolsonaro could soften his stance, now he's won power? Few experts believe it. You only need to look to another firebrand in the continent for guidance. "The things that Donald Trump outlined and the signals that he gave during the campaign he carried through with," says Kyle Pope of the Columbia Journalism Review, who has studied parallels between Brazil's new president and the leader of the US. Many say a comparison with Mr Trump is inaccurate. Instead, they say Mr Bolsonaro is more akin to Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines. Whatever the comparison, what is clear is that country's sharp swing to the right will resonate beyond Brazil as another populist takes power. And the opposition will redouble efforts not to take away the gains that country's made since it returned to democracy 30 years ago. The future looks messy for Brazil. Does Mr Bolsonaro have backing in Congress? Yes and no. On the one hand, his PSL party achieved a remarkable breakthrough in this month's legislative election, increasing its representation from one to 52 seats in the lower house. However Mr Haddad's PT remains the largest party, with 56 seats. But most ominously for Mr Bolsonaro, there will be a record 30 parties represented in the next Congress. This suggest that finding backing for legislation could be difficult for the new president. What about reaction from outside Brazil? A number of Latin American leaders congratulated Mr Bolsonaro: Amnesty International said that taking into account his campaign pledges, Mr Bolsonaro's victory could pose a "huge risk" to Brazil's indigenous peoples, LGBT communities, black youth, women, activists and civil society organisations.
By Lucy HookerBusiness reporter, BBC News The victim was his business American Superconductor (AMSC), and the perpetrator was a Chinese company called Sinovel Windpower. The two firms had been partners, but Sinovel bribed an insider to steal AMSC's key wind turbine technology. As a result Massachusetts-based AMSC saw its sales collapse, its market value plummet by $1bn (£770m), and it had to lay off hundreds of employees. "It was attempted corporate homicide," says Mr McGahn. This act of industrial espionage was uncovered back in 2011, and after a seven-year legal fight, a US judge last month fined Sinovel just $1.5m, the maximum currently possible. While Sinovel is also continuing to pay AMSC an agreed settlement of $57.5m, the US firm is getting back just a fraction of the losses it endured. The case of AMSC is perhaps exactly what President Trump has in mind when he rages against Chinese industrial espionage. At the start of last month the US government introduced tariffs on $34bn worth of Chinese exports, saying they were a result of China's "unfair trade practices", which included stealing US intellectual property. A few days later the White House warned that the tariffs could be extended to $200bn worth of Chinese products. Then three weeks ago Trump threatened to put tariffs on all $500bn worth of annual Chinese exports to the US. Will such a blanket tactic get Chinese firms to stop carrying out acts of industrial espionage, or should the US switch to a more targeted approach? Firstly though, exactly how did Sinovel bribe an AMSC worker? Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: When AMSC's wind power division first went into partnership with Sinovel back in 2007, it was applauded for its global ambition and business nous at a time when countries around the world were rushing to build more and more wind farms. AMSC knew that tying up with a Chinese firm came with risks, so it used all kinds of strategies to limit this, such as encrypting the software codes or "brains" that operated its turbines. Yet without warning, in 2011 Sinovel said it didn't need any more shipments of the turbine technology it had been buying from AMSC. Despite the American firm's best efforts to defend its secrets, Sinovel had bribed an AMSC employee, a Serbian national employed at its office in Austria, to hand over the key software. The man in question - Dejan Karabasevic - had been offered money, a job, an apartment, a whole new life in China. He was found guilty by a court in Austria in 2011. AMSC's case is far from unique, and US firms in sectors from metals to microchips, and telecoms and transport have complained about Chinese rivals stealing their technology. Even US biscuit stable Oreo cookies faced a Chinese copycat. The situation is said to be so bad that the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, an independent US body including representatives from the public and private sectors, estimates that $600bn worth of US intellectual property is stolen every year, led by China. Mr McGahn points out that the rules on foreign investment in China - such as the need to partner with a Chinese company - make it difficult for even the most careful overseas companies to protect their trade secrets. He says the whole system for investing in China is set up for local firms to win. Just a few months into Mr Trump's presidency, experts convened at the White House - technical specialists, policy wonks, cabinet members and academics - to discuss how to tackle the problem. Following a seven-month investigation a White House report accused Beijing of "state-led, market-distorting forced technology transfers". The Chinese government always says it is doing its best to prevent infringement of intellectual property, and in 2015 it pledged to clean up those firms not playing by the rules. But Derek Scissors, China expert at the American Enterprise Institute think tank, says China has long been a "technology leech". In his view Beijing stands squarely behind the Chinese firms committing the thefts. "The idea that these firms are engaging in mass industrial espionage without the blessing of the Chinese government is not the slightest bit believable," says Mr Scissors, who was one of the experts who advised the White House on the issue. "The Chinese monitor everything." Other observers suggest that it is a more subtle process. Mara Hvistendahl, a fellow of the New America think tank and author of a forthcoming book on industrial espionage, says that Beijing simply "looks the other way when companies steal in order to deliver [technological breakthroughs]". Both agree though that prosecuting spies who are caught red-handed is no longer enough. It is the equivalent of arresting drug-mules, rather than the masterminds, when tackling the illegal drug trade, Ms Hvistendahl says. Moreover, espionage is increasingly taking place in cyberspace, allowing perpetrators to remain thousands of miles beyond the reach of law enforcers. Skilful hackers may not even leave a trace of their break in. The other obstacle to successful legal prosecutions is a lack of plaintiffs willing to face the exposure, points out Professor Mark Button, director of the Centre for Counter Fraud Studies at Portsmouth University in the UK. "Imagine a big pharma company has a wonder drug; if that information is lost to a competitor that can have big financial implications," he says. "It can be embarrassing and it can have implications for the share price." For that reason Prof Button speculates that the lack of high profile cases in Europe in recent years, probably disguises a hidden iceberg of incidents below the surface. The only really effective counterespionage strategy may be better defence at the company-level, he suggests. But Prof Button has some sympathy with Mr Trump's massive tariffs approach in confronting China over their practices, in precipitating "a showdown" over the problem. Derek Scissors is much more sceptical: "The solution we've come up with is completely misguided." He says blanket tariffs fail to distinguish between firms that have benefited from espionage and those that have not. "You have to punish the guilty or you don't get a change of behaviour," he says. Instead he'd like to see sanctions targeted against specific firms - ones that are clearly reproducing American technology that they haven't developed themselves. He believes that would be more effective than "the quick fix" chosen by the administration. But targeting and punishing individual companies is a tough road to travel as AMSC's experience shows. While AMSC continues to rebuild its business, Sinovel is continuing to thrive.
Sunday's missile launch was a successful one and it demonstrated North Korea's longest-range nuclear-capable weapon yet. Accompanying photographs showed it to be the same missile on parade last month at a massive military parade to mark the birth anniversary of North Korea's founding father Kim Il-sung. Current leader Kim Jong-un was on-site according to photos released from North Korean state media KCNA and Rodong Sinmun. In the hours afterwards, the statistics of the launch perplexed some observers, even to the point of questioning the data. With tensions high, US Pacific Command was careful to categorise the flight as "not consistent with an intercontinental ballistic missile", which is - in short - one which could reach the US mainland. One step further This "mystery" missile is now revealed to be a powerful intermediate range missile, which North Korea claims can deliver a large and heavy nuclear warhead. This vague statement leaves the door open to a range of possibilities, including that North Korea has not been able to make a compact warhead, or even that a new warhead will be revealed in the future. North Korean state media said the missile had been launched over the country and into the sea east of the Korean Peninsula 787km (489 miles) away from its launch site near Kusong. It reached an altitude of 2,111.1km according to KCNA. These figures fit approximately with statements made by both American and Japanese officials monitoring the situation. While unusual, this sharp trajectory with an extremely high altitude allowed North Korean scientists to test the range of the missile without directly flying over any neighbouring countries. The altitude would also allow the North to test the atmospheric re-entry vehicle under the extreme heat, pressure and vibration. The KCNA noted both facts in its public statement on Monday. This "lofted" trajectory would be equivalent to over 4,500km if launched at a standard trajectory, putting US bases in Guam well in range. It is indeed the longest-range missile North Korea has ever tested (aside from its space launch vehicles). Deeply disturbing Photographs indicate the Hwasong-12 to be a single stage, liquid-fuelled rocket, which would be unusually inefficient at this range due to the weight of the frame, fuel and oxidisers. One possibility is that the body of the rocket is intended to be one part of a larger multi-staged intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching well into the US mainland. In this way, North Korea can make iterative progress towards an ICBM without immediately crossing Trump's red line. The missile launch, occurring just days after the new South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office, is deeply disturbing to many observers. Missile testing under Kim Jong-un increased dramatically compared with his father and grandfather's programmes. This test marks the 10th test of 2017, and this particular missile shows a greater range than any other tested in its military programme. South Korea's new president has espoused dialogue with North Korea, and is now forced to take a tougher line just days into his administration. So once again North Korea, with its rapidly advancing missile technology and the decline in relations with its neighbours, including China, has left diplomats scratching their heads.

The meetings are significant markers on the country's carefully choreographed political stage. This year, the parliament is expected to rubberstamp major constitutional changes that will elevate the power of President Xi Jinping. It will also confirm dropping China's two-term presidential limit. That would mean Xi Jinping could stay in power for life, leading China according to his new ideological guidelines, known as "Xi Jinping Thought". Here's what will go on during the sessions. Who is meeting? The National People's Congress (NPC). That's the legislature or parliament. Think the House of Commons in the UK, or the US House of Representatives. According to the constitution, the NPC is the most powerful state organ - but it's often labelled a "rubber-stamp" body by international observers, meaning it will always approve what it's told to approve. This year, the NPC has 2,980 deputies representing China's provinces, autonomous regions, centrally-administered municipalities, the special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau, and the armed forces. Among those are 742 women - that's around 25% this time, more than the last NPC - and also 438 ethnic minority deputies. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). That's the most powerful political advisory body. Think House of Lords or the US Senate. The CPPCC is strictly advisory in nature - it does not have any legislative power. The current CPPCC has 2,158 members, including people from entertainment, sports, science, business and non-Communist parties. Referred to as the "two sessions" (liang hui), these meetings traditionally last between one and two weeks. This year the CPPCC started on 3 March and the NPC will start on 5 March. What can we expect? The "two sessions" have special significance this year as they come after the once-in-five-years Communist Party Congress of October 2017. That congress saw an unprecedented cementing of power for President Xi, elevating him on the same level as the country's inaugural communist leader Mao Zedong. The NPC is expected to: The "two sessions" will also look at any plans for economic reform, as well as Mr Xi's other two focus areas: corruption and protecting the environment. Meanwhile, the CPPCC will review past policies of central and local governments and formulate plans for the future. Economic issues will be a key focus as 2018 marks the 40th anniversary of China's reform and opening up policy. Will there be any opposition? Don't expect too many surprises at what some describe as Asia's largest political pantomime. Whatever will be decided or debated usually is pre-determined by the Communist Party. There have been instances, though, where the NPC did raise objections. In 2006 for instance, the government deferred a property tax law after it sparked a debate in the NPC. Commonly referred to as a one party state, China does in fact have several other official parties alongside the Communists. Largely dismissed inside and outside the country as mere democratic window dressing, these parties unanimously support the Communists within the NPC. How is it viewed in China? Chinese state media are giving extensive coverage to the two sessions but you won't find any criticism undermining the two assemblies as mere rubber stamp groups. China Radio International praises the fact the "long-awaited revamping of state institutions" will be high on the NPC's agenda. Beijing-based website China Finance Online lists sustainable industrial growth, building on benefits from the Belt and Road initiative and poverty alleviation as the key themes for the meetings. Meanwhile, dissident media such as US-based NTDTV.com report that petitioners from several provinces are heading to Beijing to highlight their grievances. In a tradition dating back to imperial times, each year, petitioners stream into the capital to seek justice by appealing to the country's rulers. During the two sessions, they are usually kept out of the public eye so as to not disrupt the political theatre. But there has been some criticism also within China of the proposal to end the presidency term limit. Li Datong has urged lawmakers to vote against this proposal. "It [two-term limit on the presidency introduced in the 1982 constitution] was the highest and most effective legal restriction meant to prevent autocracy or putting individuals above the party and the state", the former editor of state-run China Youth Daily said in an open letter to the legislators. He told the BBC such a move would be "considered a farce in Chinese history in the future". Reporting by Tilak Jha, BBC Monitoring.

It is the second year in succession that Iceland has topped the foundation's Global Gender Gap Report. Nordic nations dominate the top of the list of 134 countries, with Norway in second place and Finland third. The report measures equity in the areas of politics, education, employment and health. Sweden is in fourth place, with New Zealand fifth. "Nordic countries continue to lead the way in eliminating gender inequality," said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum. "Low gender gaps are directly correlated with high economic competitiveness. Women and girls must be treated equally if a country is to grow and prosper." The UK came 15th in the latest rankings - no change from 2009. France was one of the biggest fallers, down to 46th place from 18th in 2009. WEF that said was a result of a decline in the number of women holding ministerial positions in the French government. Meanwhile the US has risen to 19th place from 31st in 2009, because of a higher number of women in President Obama's administration and a reduction in the country's gender pay gap. It means the US overtakes Canada to become the best-performing country in either North or South America. At the bottom of the list of 134 countries, the widest gaps between women and men are in Pakistan (132), Chad (133) and Yemen (134). WEF said that across all the nations surveyed, the divisions between men and women were lowest in health and education, but highest when it comes to economic participation and opportunity. Ricardo Hausmann, co-author of the report and director of the Centre for International Development at Harvard University, said: "Progress will be achieved when countries seek to reap returns on the investment in health and education of girls and women by finding ways to make marriage and motherhood compatible with the economic participation of women." Lesotho was the best performing African country, ranking eighth, up from 10th place in 2009. The Philippines continues to lead the way in Asia, remaining in ninth position.
He received his medal at a private event in Stockholm before a scheduled concert in the city. No further details were given. Swedish Academy officials previously said Dylan would not deliver his Nobel lecture, a traditional condition of receiving the 8m krona ($900,000, £727,000) prize money, at the event. He is expected to deliver a taped version of the lecture later. If he does not deliver a lecture by June, he will have to forfeit the prize money. A member of the Swedish Academy, which awards the prize, told the Associated Press news agency "it went very well indeed", and that 75-year-old Dylan was "a very nice, kind man". In an earlier blog post, the academy's secretary said the setting would be "small and intimate". No media were present at Dylan's request. After receiving the prize, Dylan performed a concert on Saturday evening at the Stockholm Waterfront venue. A second concert is planned for Sunday evening. The Nobel Prize for literature has usually been associated with poets and novelists. But the academy handed Dylan the prize "for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition". Dylan failed to attend the December ceremony, citing previous commitments. In a speech read on his behalf, he said it was "truly beyond words" and he thought his odds of winning were as likely "standing on the moon".

1. Nobody appears to know they are there The other diners appear to be totally oblivious to the presence of the US president, a celebrity chef, and presumably a substantial security detail, photographers and film crew. "Love how the diners were so good at pretending they had no idea who is sitting at the table next to them," tweeted Brazilian journalist Sofia Perpetua. The crowd outside the restaurant was slightly less restrained. The discussion on Reddit, which attracted 3,000 users, spilled over into where any secret service agents might be hiding. 2. The symmetrical food On the menu was bun cha, a Vietnamese dish of grilled pork and rice noodles, some greens, all washed down with Hanoi beer. On social media, there were questions about the positioning of the food. "The perfect alignment of the food disturbs me," said an Instagram user. "Look at how symmetrical the bowls, chopsticks and plates are." A bit more joie de vivre from another user: "Eating in perfect symmetry, awesome and smart." 3. Presidential chopstick skills - but a wrapper on the floor Anthony Bourdain was quick to praise the president's chopsticks skills, describing them as "on point". And everyone seemed to agree. "Proud of the president, that he placed his chopsticks neatly on top of his bowl and not stabbed them into the noodles - that would have been so rude and a big sign of disrespect," said another user. A photo from a different angle irritated another Twitter user. "Is it just me or does anyone not realise how a red chopstick wrapper has been dropped on the floor? Taking points away from him." 4. Plastic stools and Hanoi beer The unpicking of the details in the picture became about the Vietnamese things in life. "Ah, our rickety blue plastic stools - that's Vietnam for you," said Instagram user Chi Mai. "No fancy interior, just simple furniture to let the food and conversation do the talking," said another. Others wanted to know the US leader's choice of brew. Question: "What kind of beer did they drink," asked Mic Vo on Twitter. Answer: "Don't disappoint me, hope they had Bia Ha Noi," said another user. 5. The talk over noodles Another question that boggled the minds of social media users: What could the world's most famous TV chef and one of the world's most powerful leaders be talking about? Speculation ranged from Donald Trump to food to curing cancer, achieving world peace and finding unicorns. We don't know how long the meal even lasted. Some accomplished foodies could polish off a meal like that in less than 10 minutes. Perhaps they spoke about the fact that the president had just lifted the US arms embargo on Vietnam. 6. So what was the photo really for? Mr Obama found time to sit down for dinner just hours after his announcement about the embargo. Others on social media, saw it as publicity for Bourdain's food show. How much did they plan it," asked Instagram user FlyMy90. "Were they filming for an episode of Bourdain's show?" "Dinner will air in September," the White House was quoted as saying by one journalist. Despite the speculation about the staging, the picture still delighted many around the world. "Think you're cool? You'll never be eating noodles, drinking beer and sitting on low plastic chairs while talking to Anthony Bourdain and Barack Obama in Vietnam-cool," tweeted New York resident Jon Hopper.

The Beijing government summoned the Norwegian ambassador in protest. It called Mr Liu a "criminal", saying the award violated Nobel principles and could damage relations with Norway. The Norwegian Nobel committee said Mr Liu was "the foremost symbol" of the struggle for human rights in China. US President Barack Obama called for Mr Liu's immediate release. "We call on the Chinese government to release Mr Liu as soon as possible," Mr Obama, last year's Nobel Peace Prize winner, said in a statement. "Over the last 30 years, China has made dramatic progress in economic reform and improving the lives of its people, lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty. "But this award reminds us that political reform has not kept pace, and that the basic human rights of every man, woman and child must be respected," Mr Obama said. Other Western countries have also urged China to release Mr Liu. 'Insult' Mr Liu, 54, was a key leader in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Last year he received an 11-year sentence for "inciting subversion" after drafting Charter 08 - which called for multi-party democracy and respect for human rights in China. Announcing its 2010 peace prize in Oslo, the Nobel Foundation said: "Liu has consistently maintained that the sentence violates both China's own constitution and fundamental human rights." It praised Mr Liu for his "long and non-violent struggle" and highlighted its belief in a "close connection between human rights and peace". The citation described him as "the foremost symbol of this wide-ranging struggle for human rights in China". Beijing quickly condemned the award, saying it could damage China-Norway relations. Foreign ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said: "Liu Xiaobo is a criminal who violated Chinese law. It's a complete violation of the principles of the prize and an insult to the peace prize itself for the Nobel committee to award the prize to such a person." Later Norway said its ambassador in Beijing had been summoned to the Chinese foreign ministry. "They wanted to officially share their... disagreement and their protest," a Norwegian spokeswoman said. "We emphasised that this is an independent committee and the need to continue good bilateral relations," she added. 'Growing consensus' Unlike other Nobel prizes, which are administered in Sweden, the peace prize is awarded in Oslo by a committee appointed by the Norwegian parliament. The prize is worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.5m; £944,000) and will be awarded in Oslo on 10 December. In New York, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the award to Mr Liu was "a recognition of the growing international consensus for improving human rights practices and culture around the world". German government spokesman Steffen Seibert said China should free him so he could attend the ceremony. France's Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner also welcomed the award and also called on China to release Mr Liu. UN human rights commissioner Navi Pillay said the prize recognised a "very prominent human rights defender". Mr Liu's wife, Liu Xia, said she was "so excited" by the award. She told AFP news agency: "I want to thank everyone for supporting Liu Xiaobo. I strongly ask that the Chinese government release Liu." Mrs Liu said police had informed her they would take her to Mr Liu's prison in the north-eastern province of Liaoning on Saturday so she could give him the news.
They were not members of so-called Islamic State but had tried to make contact with the group, officials said. The justice minister said the group was in the planning stage of an attack and police acted as a preventative measure. Alexandre Moraes described the cell as "absolute amateurs" and "ill-prepared" to launch an attack. All those arrested were Brazilian and two more suspects were being sought, he said. They were detained across 10 different states, and had been in contact via messaging services such as Whatsapp. Group members had attempted to contact a weapons supplier in neighbouring Paraguay to get AK 47 assault rifles, but there was no evidence of any being bought. An emergency meeting of the Brazilian cabinet has been called. More than 80,000 police and soldiers will patrol Rio streets for the games which end on 21 August. The federal government said last week that it was releasing an extra $24m (£18m) to beef up security ahead of the Olympics. The International Olympic Committee recently concluded that Rio de Janeiro had overcome setbacks and was "ready to welcome the world" to the 2016 Olympics. There have been fears over Rio's readiness because of building delays, the Zika virus and political crises. Mr Moraes told a news conference there was a "minimal probability of a terrorist act during the Rio Olympics."
A limited service was in place for the second evening rush hour of the strike, which began on Tuesday at 21:00 GMT. The RMT and TSSA unions said they would take part in talks with management on Friday aimed at resolving the dispute. The first of two planned strikes has ended, but services will not be back to normal until Friday morning London Underground (LU) said. LU said up to 190 of 270 stations were open, but a full service could not resume immediately because of shift patterns. Further industrial action is planned for Friday between 09:30 and 11:30 and 18:30 to 20:30, when the unions are asking members to leave ticket barriers open. They are also urging members not to issue penalty fares. LU's chief operating officer Phil Hufton said the company was "not obliged to pay employees in full if they refuse to carry out their full range of contractual duties". Earlier Transport for London (TfL) said nine of the 11 lines were running and nearly 75% of stations were open, more than on Wednesday. For a second day millions of commuters were affected, many to relying on buses instead of the Underground. 'Wiggle room' Ahead of Friday's planned talks, the Mayor of London Boris Johnson told BBC London 94.9, there was "wiggle room". He apologised to people who had experienced disruption and repeated that he thought passengers would be safer and better protected with members of staff on concourses, instead of "behind plate glass". The mayor said the unions had shown a "failure to engage" in talks, adding: "Rather than hurting hard-working Londoners and hard-pressed small businesses they should have been talking to TfL this week." 'Get serious' RMT leader Bob Crow said it was the first he had heard of "wiggle room", adding: "My negotiators have been told for the last five weeks there is none." TSSA leader Manuel Cortes said it was time for the mayor to "get serious", saying 70% of the network was at a standstill. He said: "We want no more stunts or PR baloney from Boris. We want serious and detailed talks on our genuine fears for the safety and security of passengers and staff under these far-reaching plans." James, from Harrow, who supervises a small station, told BBC London 94.9 he was worried about his job and the safety implications of the changes. He said he was currently a supervisor at one station and had one other staff member with him. Under the changes, he would have to oversee five stations. He said: "I don't want to strike. It's the first time I've ever been on strike. "But there are incidents every day - someone who is blind, or someone who wants guidance. Very rarely do you have one person at a station." Police staff Philip, from Croydon, works in a ticket office and said workers still had to handle lots of Oyster-related problems, including visitors from overseas wanting refunds before they return home. TfL has said its proposed changes, which will lead to 960 job losses - but none compulsory - will modernise systems and save £50m a year. The industrial action came as the government said it was considering plans to declare London Underground an essential service, akin to the police, in order to curb the threat of future strikes. Thousands of Metropolitan Police civilian staff are planning to strike for two days in a row over a 1% wage rise. The action will coincide with the next planned 48-hour Tube strike.

The state has now had more diagnosed cases of the virus than any single country. It has the grim distinction of being at the forefront of a global health crisis. Anthony is now working 16-hour days to try to save people across the city, while supporting colleagues who fear for their lives and their families. Anthony, a lieutenant paramedic and vice president of the Fire Department of New York's Emergency Medical Services officers' union, talked the BBC's Alice Cuddy through what happened last Sunday - what he calls the toughest day of his career. I got a pretty good night's sleep considering all the calls going on the day before. A solid five hours. I get up and listen to the news in the shower. More Covid-19 but the world still seems intact. I have to get ready to be at work in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, at 06:00 for a 16-hour shift. I put on my uniform, grab my radio and start the process of decontaminating my equipment. We have to wipe down all the radios, keys, trucks, bags and the rest of the gear. This virus can stay alive on everything. Nothing is safe - even your co-workers. In wars you see the bullet, you know who your enemy is. This is a war with an invisible bullet - everyone you come into contact with is a bullet who could get you. I log on that morning at 06:02. I'm able to go get a bite to eat at the bagel shop. I start to hear the radio get busy around 07:00. We have already had more than 1,500 calls since midnight. I get called for the assignment - a cardiac arrest. As a lieutenant I go with the medic and emergency medical technician crews to help treat patients and provide resources as needed. These days there aren't many resources as most days there are well over 6,500 calls. New York City has the busiest emergency medical services (EMS) system in the world - with about 4,000 calls a day on average. Sometimes you get a spike like with a heatwave or a hurricane, but the busiest day before this was 9/11. That day, we had 6,400 calls but that wasn't 6,400 patients - either you made it out or you didn't. This is 9/11 call volume with patients every day. We noticed the spike in cases around March 20. By the 22nd it was like a bomb. When we saw this spike, the system wasn't set up for it. We were like: 'How are we going to do this with the resources we have?' It was just a case of 'let's get going'. Right now, about 20% of the EMS workforce is out sick. We have a lot of members who've contracted Covid-19, we have members who are in the ICU - I have two of them who are on ventilators - and we have over 700 people who are being monitored with the symptoms. We arrive at the house and I put on my mask, gown and gloves. We find a man. His family says he has had a fever and cough for five days. We start CPR and I watch the medics pass a tube down his throat to breathe for him and the IV gets started. We work on him for about 30 minutes before we pronounce him dead. I make sure the crews are OK and get back in my truck - decontaminating everything first. I hit the button to go available. Twenty minutes later, I get another cardiac arrest. Same symptoms, same procedures, same results. This virus attacks the lungs: you can't get enough oxygen into your system, then other systems start to shut down and then organ failure. We hit the button, get another one. Hit the button after that, get another one. There's only one patient we've seen so far who I feel wasn't Covid-19 and that's because it was a suicide. Imagine: I was there and my brain felt relief. This person's dead and it's a suicide. I felt relief that it was a regular job. It is now around 11:00 and I've done about six cardiac arrests. In normal times, a medic gets two or three in a week, maybe. You can have a busy day sometimes, but never this. Never this. The seventh call gets to me. We walk in and there's a woman on the floor. I see this woman doing CPR on her mother. She tells me she stopped breathing and had "the symptoms". We go to work to try and save her. As the medics are doing their thing I walk over to the daughter and she tells me how it all went down. She says her mum has been sick for the last few days. They couldn't get a test but think she had "it". I ask "are you the only family here?" She says yes but you guys were here on Thursday and worked on my dad. He had the symptoms as well. He passed away. She looks numb. I go back into the other room and hope that the medic will tell me there are signs of life. She looks up and I know the look after 17 years. The medic's eyes say no. So now I have to tell the daughter that both her parents are dead in a matter of three days. Her dad's not even buried yet. So this woman is going to have a double funeral, if she's lucky enough to get a funeral, because funerals aren't happening right now. After that call I go outside and the cool air is what I need. We sit for a minute to try and recoup but we all feel it. Funny, we don't discuss it much. Medics tend to do that. We have to get ready for the next one. We hit the button. We get another one and so on and so on. It's about 18:00 and I just finished my tenth one. It's an Asian family who cannot believe their uncle has died. I see in their eyes they can't believe it. They keep imploring me to do something, to take him to the hospital, and I tell them we couldn't, even if we wanted to. The hospitals are not working on anyone who has no signs of life. They keep saying "you have to save him, you have to save him". The son asks why we can't just start his heart again. The hard thing about wearing the mask is it covers half my face. All he's hearing are the words. If I'm able to show my face it lets the patient's family see the emotion behind it. Now all they see is my eyes and my eyes are in terror because I don't know if I can convince this kid that there's nothing more we can do. I'm on this call with the medics who were with me at the house with the daughter who lost both parents. They come outside and see me sitting on the stoop. I've had to tell 10 families we couldn't do any more. I am beside myself with feelings of bewilderment. I've never had to do a day like this in my career. I'm emotionally drained. The things we see are sometimes difficult to shake. And with this, people are going to be different afterwards. There's no way that the majority of EMS workers are going to come out of this happy-go-lucky. Maybe some of them will have these moments of clarity and appreciate the flowers and the sunrise, but for a lot of us, when we close our eyes, we're going to see this. The medics see me and come over and sit next to me. They both put their arms around me and we support each other. It was their fifth arrest that day. All of us know what we are feeling. We just feel it together for a bit. We sit and then hit the button. It's 21:30 - half an hour to the end of my tour. Another arrest. Same symptoms - fever and cough for days. We work on him until I have to go and tell my twelfth family that I'm sorry we can't do any more. I've never been so drained and I go back to get ready to go home. I'm single and have no kids. This is the only time in my life that I've ever been happy that I'm single because I don't bring it home. But so many people are worried about this. I signed up for a job where I can get sick and die. Members' families signed up knowing that their loved one could get sick and die on this job, but they did not sign up for the loved one to bring it home to them. Right now I have guys who sleep in their car because they do not want to bring it home to their families. The stress that members have that weighs heavily on me is their worry that if they die on the job their families won't be taken care of. I'm 16 years in therapy, I'm a practising Buddhist and I meditate, but even I'm having trouble disconnecting now. The emotional drain that happens on days like this stays with you because you know you're going to have to go to work tomorrow for another 16 hours and you're going to get it again. Medics survive a career in this because we always have hope that OK, we didn't save this one but the next one we will save. We are pretty good at saving people's lives. But with this virus the odds are against us. Hope fades fighting it. We are fighting an invisible enemy that is taking out our co-workers - and right now, hope is fleeting. This is happening all over the city. Not one of the 12 people suspected to have died of Covid-19 on Anthony's shift had been tested for coronavirus. As a result, their deaths were not included in the official coronavirus death toll in New York last Sunday, which stood at 594.
By Jenny SimsBBC News Magazine There are two sporting Britains. In the first, hundreds of thousands troop to stadia each week to watch football, rugby or other popular, mainstream games. In the second, participants enjoy such activities as pea-shooting, wife-carrying and black-pudding throwing. Eccentric they might be. Entirely serious they are not. But eating nettles, pulling silly faces, wrestling with one's toes and collecting worms all form part of a less-discussed side of the nation's competitive culture. What's more, these bizarre traditions are not as marginal as the layman might think, drawing diverse crowds to remote parts of the country. The UK hosts at least 20 outlandish sporting events which draw enthusiasts and amateurs from all over the world. Bog-snorkelling entices participants from as far afield as Australia, others give shin-kicking a go and the practice of chasing Double Gloucester cheese wheels down hills is long-established. Some of these extraordinary sports can be traced back as far as the 13th Century. Chipping Campden is one such host of unusual historical games. The Cotswold Olimpicks are held during spring bank each year where attendances have been over 5,000. Eccentrics and novices flock to Dover's Hill, keen to have some fun. And occasionally get hurt. Competitors can participate in shin-kicking, which is centuries old. It sounds painful but a bit of straw padding can offer protection. Rules state one must hold onto the opponent and kick their shins until they fall to the floor, under the watchful eye of the stickler, or referee. Clive Thompson, vice-chairman of the Games, believes the unique traditional 17th Century roots are the attraction. Thankfully, nowadays the dress code no longer includes iron-tipped boots. Broken legs used to be the norm. Getting injured in the name of fun is all too familiar for those who each year take to Cooper's Hill in Gloucestershire to chase a wheel of cheese. Every spring bank holiday, up to its cancellation in 2010 and this year, about 200 people would climb the notoriously steep hill, almost vertical in places, to take part in this two-centuries-old tradition. After a head start for the cheese, competitors would run down the hill trying to catch it, inevitably tumbling to the bottom. In 1997, 33 cheese-rollers were treated for everything from splinters to broken bones. In 2005, some races were delayed due to the lack of ambulances - because they were all already at A&E with other competitors. Sarrah Macey of the Gloucester Folk Museum has been a spectator. "Half of me was really scared, shielding my eyes from the injuries, the other half was excitedly egging-on the leader to catch the cheese," she recalls. Some keep their bones intact and, instead, get down and dirty. This August bank holiday, many people donning goggles, a snorkel and flippers, will immerse themselves in sludgy, peaty water. Out of choice. More than 200 competitors will travel to the World Bog Snorkelling Championships, which date back to 1985, to swim the 60-yard peat bog in Llanwrtyd Wells, Wales. Conventional swimming strokes are not allowed. Serial bog-snorkellers Kez Mercel and Tigger Webb fly from Australia every year to join in the fun. "The water comprises of ancient rotted vegetation swilling in black acidic water," say the pair, enticingly. But the bog must have something endearing about it. "We have the world's best beaches on the Gold Coast; however, we go half-way around the world to swim in a bog. That's how good it is," they add. Despite dreadful weather, last year's event drew over 1,000 attendees. Those steering clear of mud could head to the home of extraordinary sports, the Egremont Crab Fair in Cumbria. Events include gurning, speed pipe smoking and greasy pole climbing. Gurning, the act of grotesquely contorting one's face, attracts up to 100 competitors a year and features in the Guinness World Records thanks to Tommy Mattinson who has won the championship title 11 times. Another long-standing event even reportedly helped to inspire the world's most famous sporting competition. Much Wenlock in Shropshire has Olympic history running through its veins. Ask the majority of people when and where the modern Olympics began, and they would say Athens, 1896. But to some sport historians, it really began there in 1850. The Much Wenlock Olympics now run every summer and this year should attract not quite the 10,000 competitors joining the London 2012 line-up, but more like 1,200. It includes typical Olympic-style events. In the early Wenlock Olympian Games, one event had old women race in order to win a pound of tea. That's mild compared with the other bizarre sports of today. These are a mere handful from a plethora of similar events staged in Britain each year, and they are somehow surviving. Macey believes it's down to tradition, and that these sports are a key part of the British identity. "Many visitors to Gloucestershire solely come to experience the cheese-rolling, shin-kicking or the bog-snorkelling because that's what they think of as quintessentially British." Benedict le Vay, author of Eccentric Britain, agrees. "It's part of British eccentricity. We get wonderful humour, off-the-wall explorers, wacky inventors and bonkers aristocrats out of the same tin, and we have a heck of a lot of fun," he says. He believes in Britain, often if you try something twice and enjoy it, it becomes a tradition. "People are wedded to tradition and will always find a way. World War II didn't even stop Gloucester townsfolk from cheese-rolling, who [with] rationing, used a wooden model cheese instead. "It doesn't matter what we're doing or why, people get carried away in the enjoyment, and return again and again, daft or not," he adds. Despite being banned, in 2010 100 people were still cheese-rolling down Cooper's Hill in an unauthorised event. Macey believes there is a future for these quirky games thanks to loyal cult followers and promotion through travel guides. Le Vay agrees. New sports are invented all the time. Many are the result of a conversation in the pub, as was the case with the World Stinging Nettle Eating Championships. "The best thing about these sports is there's a bit of risk, and they don't require skill," Macey says. "It's often about luck and every competitor feels the thrill of the possibility of holding that prize cheese at the bottom of the hill. It's a chance for people to show courage and be a winner".
Italians have nicknamed him "Forrest Gump" on social media, after the slow-witted hero of a 1994 movie, played by Tom Hanks, who runs thousands of miles across the United States. Police stopped the Italian's epic walk at 2am in Fano on the Adriatic coast, a week after he left Como in the north. The man, 48, got a €400 (£362; $485) police fine for breaching the curfew. The story was first reported by the Bologna-based newspaper Il Resto del Carlino but quickly went viral in Italian media. Some comments on social media presented the man as heroic and criticised the fine. One said he should have been rewarded - not fined - and given a new pair of shoes. Another praised him for walking off to cool his anger, rather than resorting to violence. The man told police "I came here on foot, I didn't use any transport". He said "along the way I met people who offered me food and drink". "I'm OK, just a bit tired," he said, having averaged 60km daily. Police found him wandering aimlessly and cold at night on a coastal highway. After checking his ID in their database they found that his wife had reported him missing, so they contacted her and she travelled to Fano to collect him. The Italian reports did not say how she reacted upon learning that he had picked up a €400 fine. More on coronavirus lockdown: WATCH: How Italians struggled with lockdown in April:
By Kerry Allen and Chris BellBBC Monitoring and BBC News Accepting the award for his performance in Bohemian Rhapsody, a biopic of British rock act Queen and lead singer Freddie Mercury, Rami Malek said the film could help those struggling with their identity. "We made a film about a gay man, an immigrant, who lived his life unapologetically himself," the actor said. But Mango TV, one of China's most popular channels, avoided using the words "gay man", instead translating them as "special group". The broadcaster has previously come under fire for censoring LGBT references in the Eurovision Song Contest. You might also be interested in: The mistranslation has generated significant reaction online. Tens of thousands of users of Sina Weibo, a Chinese micro-blogging platform, shared screenshots of the broadcaster's coverage. Prominent music blogger Linglei Guodu was among those to note the mistranslation. "Mango TV translated 'gay man' as 'special group'", the blogger wrote on Weibo, alongside a screenshot of Mango TV's broadcast, in a post that has more than 14,000 shares. "There are still so many people in today's society who show prejudice or discriminate by referring to so-called 'special people'," another user wrote. "Even the word 'gay' can't appear on our screens, this is so sad." "What on earth are they afraid of?" one asked. Others noted previous incidents of censorship involving Mango TV. In 2018, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) barred the Chinese broadcaster from airing the Eurovision Song Contest after it censored LGBT elements of the competition, including blurring audience members' rainbow flags. The EBU said the censorship was "not in line with its values of universality and inclusivity and our proud tradition of celebrating diversity through music". Mango TV has not responded to the criticism online. Chinese authorities have embarked on a campaign in recent years aimed at purging content that it deems inappropriate. In April, Weibo announced a move to ban gay content on its platform. But that decision was reversed following a massive outcry.
The operation reportedly involved "hundreds" of workers repackaging second hand smartphone parts as new iPhones for export, with counterfeit phones produced worth 120m yuan ($19m). The factory was discovered on 14 May but was revealed on social media by Beijing's public security bureau on Sunday, according to reports. The operation was set up in January. It was led by a husband and wife team, on the northern outskirts of the Chinese capital, according to Beijing authorities. They said they had been alerted to the factory by US authorities which had seized some of the fake phones. The reports come amid an official Chinese crackdown on counterfeit goods, with authorities pushing firms to trademark their goods. China has also agreed to work with the US authorities to try to stem the large quantities of fake goods flowing between the two countries. The discovery of the factory comes four years after fake Apple stores were found in Kunming city, China. Discovered by blogger BirdAbroad, the fakes were so convincing she said many of the staff themselves were convinced that they were employed by the US electronics firm.
Officials did not give details of the judgement, but hinted at a conviction. A judiciary official said late on Sunday that the verdict could be appealed, suggesting Mr Rezaian had been found guilty. Jason Rezaian, 39, has been detained in Iran for more than a year. The Post has dismissed the charges as absurd. Appearing on state TV on Sunday, judiciary spokesman Gholamhoseyn Mohseni-Ezhei said: "He [Jason Rezaian] has been convicted, but I don't have the verdict's details." He added: "The time for an appeal is not yet over. So the court waits and if it doesn't receive an appeal... the verdict becomes final." Mr Mohseni-Ezhei said Mr Rezaian and his lawyer were eligible to appeal the conviction within 20 days. The Washington Post foreign editor, Douglas Jehl, called the ruling "vague" and said it was unclear if Mr Rezaian had been sentenced. "We've now heard from the Iranian government today's [Sunday] announcement that a verdict has been issued in Jason's case, but that it's not final and that it's subject to appeal. "That's really all we know, and unfortunately it reflects a continued pattern of mystery, opacity and gamesmanship surrounding the way Iran has handled this case. "The only thing that's been clear from the beginning is Jason's innocence. Everything else has been under a real shadow of darkness." Mr Rezaian faces 10 to 20 years in prison. Mr Rezaian, his wife, who is also a journalist, and two photojournalists were arrested in July 2014 in Iran. Mr Rezaian was the only one of the group not to be released. The Post's Tehran bureau chief since 2012, he was charged with espionage and distributing propaganda against the Islamic Republic. He is a dual Iranian-American citizen and was tried in four hearings behind closed doors, the last of which was held in August.
Piyush Goyal, Minister of Railways and Coal, tweeted that the train was "zooming past at lightning speed". Trainspotter Abhishek Jaiswal then replied with the original footage, which he said he filmed in December for his railway-themed YouTube channel. In Mr Jaiswal's clip, the same train travels at a much slower speed. In the video posted on his official Twitter account, Mr Goyal says the video shows "India's first semi-high speed train built under 'Make in India' initiative, Vande Bharat Express". As India's railways minister, he is in charge of the fourth-largest rail network in the world. The train, Train 18, is indeed India's fastest train to date. It will travel between the capital Delhi and Varanasi at a maximum speed of 130km/h (80mph). But in response, Mr Jaiswal tweeted a link to his version of the clip, which was posted to his YouTube channel The Rail Mail on 20 December. In that, the same train is significantly slower. Mr Jaiswal says the clip was filmed at Asaoti station in the northern state of Haryana. Indian news site Alt News then put the two videos together so they could be viewed side-by-side. Since the exchange, people have been mocking the minister online with their own videos of "high-speed trains". Meanwhile, some offered their own editing expertise. Mr Goyal has yet to respond to the claims. However, he has continued to post videos of trains on his social media.
Exports were up 48.3% year on year to $169.2bn, and imports dropped by a fifth to $108.6bn, said the country's General Administration of Customs. The growth in exports was well ahead of analyst expectations. China's economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, its weakest for almost a quarter of a century, and recent indicators show signs the slowdown is continuing. Holiday factor Customs officials put the surge in exports down to a flurry of activities by companies to get orders processed before the Chinese New Year, which fell in the middle of February this year. "Affected by the Spring Festival factors, export companies in the country again rushed to export ahead of the holiday and only resumed working after it," a statement said. The surplus figure stood at $8.9bn in the same period last year. But he Lunar New Year had fallen on 31 January in 2014, followed by a week-long national holiday, which meant it provided a weak comparison with this February. For the first two months of the year, China's trade surplus has totalled $120.7bn, following the $60bn surplus in January. "We still see strong headwinds facing China's exports this year," said ANZ economists Liu Ligang and Zhou Hao in a research note. Premier Li Keqiang on Thursday announced a lowered growth target of "approximately 7%" for this year, and cut the trade growth target for 2015 to "around 6%".
By Ritu PrasadBBC News As US infectious diseases chief Dr Anthony Fauci put it recently: "It's certainly going to get worse before it gets better." Here's what public health experts have to say about what the US can expect from the coronavirus. What's going to happen next? Dr Gregory Poland, director of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, says analysing a new disease is like looking at a pixelated image - when you've only rendered 30%, it's impossible to tell what the photo is. Once you load 70%, the picture gets clearer, and so on. "We're in that 30 to 50%," Dr Poland says of Covid-19. "There's a lot we genetically know about coronaviruses [and] a huge amount we don't know, clinically, epidemiologically and seasonally with regards to this virus." Worst case, Dr Poland says, based on early models, between 40 to 70% of the US will be infected. That's between 132 and 231 million people. One factor to consider is how Covid-19 is mutating - at a rate about once every other week. Dr Poland says it could be turning less virulent, as happens with other similar viruses. "With 40% infected and if there was a 1.6% case fatality rate, that would be about 2.2 million people who would die, but in a real-world case scenario the fatality rate is likely to be lower than that," Dr Poland explains, as we don't know how many people are infected but asymptomatic, for example. "It's a really foggy crystal ball and really difficult to make predictions." Dr Poland says the next best-case scenario is that doctors figure out an existing antiviral can be used to treat Covid-19. Otherwise, hopefully within the next year, scientists can develop a vaccine or other treatment therapy. "Worst case, none of those happen in a timely manner," he says. "If we don't do anything? That's tens of thousands of deaths. Hundreds of thousands possible hospitalisations." Even if Covid-19 drops to the level of the seasonal flu, if 40-70% people are infected, it will still cause a high number of deaths and hospital stays, especially among those 60 and older. "These next couple of weeks are really going to be critical. Are we going to start seeing a tip over into widespread community transmission or is it going to be relatively slow? I think these next few weeks are critical and all of us in this field are holding our breath to see what happens." Dr Poland says based on the history of similar diseases, Covid-19 may dampen or entirely disappear in the heat of summer, like SARS did in 2003. If not, it will probably circulate until it exhausts most susceptible people. "It really is speculation," he emphasises. "What happens in China is not necessarily generalisable to the US culture, and you make your best case and try to add data point-by-point to the pixelation." How prepared is the overall health system? Dr Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, warns the US healthcare system stands to be "completely overwhelmed" by a serious outbreak in its current state. Dr Wen, who previously served as the city of Baltimore's Public Health Commissioner, says the US is "critically short" of key supplies, like ventilators, protective equipment for healthcare workers and even hospital space. In a moderate outbreak as predicted by the US health agency, some 200,000 hospital intensive care beds would be required, she explains. "There are currently less than 100,000 beds right now and most of them are occupied. If there were a need for 200,000 beds and they came within a short period of each other, then we would be in a situation like Italy and Wuhan, China, where they had to ration care...Where healthcare workers had to make difficult decisions about who will get lifesaving care and who will go without." Dr Wen says that without any intervention, there will be a sharp escalation in the number of infected individuals - about 5% of whom will require intensive care. How to flatten the curve? It will be essential to spread the rate of infections over a longer period of time - flattening the curve, as it were - to reduce the number of Americans who need hospital care at one time and thus keep the system from becoming overburdened. Keeping the spike of serious infections manageable is possible, Dr Wen says, depending on the actions people - and governments - take today. "Individual and collective actions are what will make a difference in the trajectory of this illness right now," she says. "Every single action that is part of social distancing is helpful. Everything is helpful. This is not a time to let perfect be the enemy of the good." She adds that the US "absolutely" needs a national response. "This is a disease that knows no boundaries between local and state." And ideally, officials should ensure everyone can get tested so we know how much the coronavirus has spread in our communities, Dr Wen says. One US pathologist told the BBC that hospital laboratories across the country were ready to develop test assays five weeks ago but were unable to move forward due to existing FDA regulations. Now, as these rules have been walked back in recent weeks, labs are able to work on developing tests, a month and a half later. What about at the state level? Many of the issues in responding to the coronavirus in the US are tied to states' rights. Each state has its own specific health policies. All 50 have the capacity to declare a public health emergency and free up resources, though it may be done through different authorities in each state. Most states have now done so. Dr Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, describes the situation as a partnership at the local, state and federal levels, but one that can have gaps based on funding or differing political views about how involved the government should be. "We are not as prepared as we should be," Dr Benjamin told the BBC. "We have not had a year without a public health emergency since 2011. But this is the big one we have been predicting." Among the issues at play are an "underfunded public health system, a just-in-time healthcare delivery system and an under-practiced preparedness system," according to Dr Benjamin. A 2020 report by the Trust for America's Health put 25 states and the nation's capital in the high health preparedness tier. Twelve were middle and 13 were deemed low. The study found public health funding, hospital safety and flu vaccination rates had improved overall, but other measures, including clean water supply and paid sick leave had "stalled or lost ground" in the last year. Only 30% of hospitals on average earned top patient safety grades; only 55% of workers reported access to paid leave; only 49% of Americans get a flu jab. "The lesson from this must be to improve the infrastructure of the US public health system and sustain it; use innovation to scale up the health care delivery system and recognise preparedness as a national infrastructure that must be supported," Dr Benjamin says. So far, 12 states - including Florida, New York, California, and Washington state - have shut or enacted restrictions on bars and restaurants. Thirty-eight have closed public schools, along with a number of districts in other states. As the country enters mitigation mode, Dr Benjamin says he expects to see all kinds of these social distancing measures used at the state-level. "No state is yet adequately prepared to completely respond to this pandemic," he adds. "We are getting better at responding, but it remains a challenge." What about Canada? Last week, the Canadian government ramped up its response to the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau advised Canadians to postpone or cancel all non-essential international travel outside of Canada. Canada announced a C$10bn ($7.1bn; £5.7bn) programme to help businesses with a "significant" stimulus programme coming next week. Additionally, the Bank of Canada slashed the central bank's key lending rate by 50 basis points to 0.75%, the second cut this month. All cruise ships carrying over 500 passengers will not be able to dock in Canada until 1 July and the number of airports where international flights can land will be limited to enhance screening. A number of provincial governments have taken their own steps in recent days to limit contagion amid some complaints that federal counterparts had not taken an aggressive enough stance. Ontario and Quebec have closed all public schools for the next two weeks. British Columbia and Quebec have banned all public gatherings of over 250 people.
By Dr Michael MosleyBBC Vegans, for the uninitiated, do not eat meat, poultry, fish, or any products derived from animals, including eggs, dairy products, and gelatin. There are now four times as many vegans in the UK as there were four years ago. So how hard is it to convert, and what are the potential health benefits? Veganism: Why is it on the up? Why I gave up being vegan Going vegan: Is it just a fad? What does a healthy vegan diet look like? For the latest series of Trust Me I'm A Doctor, Dr Giles Yeo decided to try it for a month and see if it was a lifestyle he could imagine adopting. As Dr Yeo quickly discovered, one of the tricky things about going vegan is that many products that don't sound as if they have anything to do with animals actually do. Eggs, cheese and meat are obvious no-nos but so is mayonnaise (contains eggs), some pastas (ditto), and wine (some alcoholic drinks use fish bones or proteins from other animals as part of the production process). As well as making sure you are not accidentally consuming animal products, one of the main challenges of going vegan is to make sure you're not missing out on any key nutrients. Following a vegan diet puts you at risk of getting insufficient vitamin D, which is needed for bone health. To get this through diet, vegans may need to rely on fortified foods, including some types of soy milk, rice milk, organic orange juice, and breakfast cereals. You may also want to consider taking a vitamin D supplement. Iodine deficiency is very common in the UK, particularly among young women. Cow's milk is our main source of iodine and non-dairy alternatives, such as almond milk, have much lower levels. You can get iodine from seaweed (though the amounts are unpredictable) but you will probably need to take a supplement. The other big concern is getting enough vitamin B12. You won't find it in seeds, nuts or vegetables, so vegans and vegetarians will need to stock up with fortified breakfast cereal or nutritional yeast. Does it work? Will going vegan make you healthier? A recent analysis, which pulled together the results of 10 previous studies comparing the health of vegetarian and vegans against that of omnivores, suggests it will. The researchers found being a vegetarian or vegan was associated with a significantly lower risk of heart disease and cancer, though there was no difference in all-cause mortality. In other words, being a vegetarian or vegan was associated with being healthier but not necessarily with living longer. I say "associated with" because these were not the gold standard randomised controlled studies, where you take a large group of people and randomly allocate them to being vegan or omnivorous and see what happens. Such studies would be very hard to do. Instead, they compare people who are vegans with meat eaters and look for differences. Since vegans are likely to be more health conscious than the general population, it is possible that the health differences have nothing to do with the diet itself. So how did Dr Yeo get on? After being vegan for a month he had lost 4kg and brought in his belt by a notch. Along with the fall in his belly fat, his cholesterol also fell by 12%. So will he keep it up? "I've been pleasantly surprised," he said, "and though I don't plan to go vegan entirely, from now on I'll try and do at least a few days every month. "I have to admit I was apprehensive about going vegan for a month, but once I learned a few recipes I was fine and I actually ended up enjoying it. For me, the key was not to cook vegan versions of meals that I would normally eat with meat, but to opt for recipes that were designed to be vegan in the first place. "What I missed most while on the diet was eggs - I actually expected to miss meat a lot more." If you want to find out more about the benefits and risks of going vegan visit Trust Me I'm A Doctor.
By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent The calved block covers 1,636 sq km in area - a little smaller than Scotland's Isle of Skye - and is called D28. The scale of the berg means it will have to be monitored and tracked because it could in future pose a hazard to shipping. Not since the early 1960s has Amery calved a bigger iceberg. That was a whopping 9,000 sq km in area. Amery is the third largest ice shelf in Antarctica, and is a key drainage channel for the east of the continent. The shelf is essentially the floating extension of a number of glaciers that flow off the land into the sea. Losing bergs to the ocean is how these ice streams maintain equilibrium, balancing the input of snow upstream. So, scientists knew this calving event was coming. What's interesting is that much attention in the area had actually been focussed just to the east of the section that's now broken away. This is a segment of Amery that has affectionately become known as "Loose Tooth" because of its resemblance in satellite images to the dentition of a small child. Both ice areas had shared the same rift system. But although wobbly, Loose tooth is still attached. It's D28 that's been extracted. "It is the molar compared to a baby tooth," Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography told BBC News. Prof Fricker had predicted back in 2002 that Loose Tooth would come off sometime between 2010 and 2015. "I am excited to see this calving event after all these years. We knew it would happen eventually, but just to keep us all on our toes, it is not exactly where we expected it to be," she said. The Scripps researcher stressed that there was no link between this event and climate change. Satellite data since the 1990s has shown that Amery is roughly in balance with its surroundings, despite experiencing strong surface melt in summer. "While there is much to be concerned about in Antarctica, there is no cause for alarm yet for this particular ice shelf," Prof Fricker added. The Australian Antarctic Division will however be watching Amery closely to see if it reacts at all. The division's scientists have instrumentation in the region. It's possible the loss of such a big berg will change the stress geometry across the front of the ice shelf. This could influence the behaviour of cracks, and even the stability of Loose Tooth. D28 is calculated to be about 210m thick and contains some 315 billion tonnes of ice. The name comes from a classification system run by the US National Ice Center, which divides the Antarctic into quadrants. The D quadrant covers the longitudes 90 degrees East to zero degrees, the Prime Meridian. This is roughly Amery to the Eastern Weddell Sea. D28 is dwarfed by the mighty A68 berg, which broke away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in 2017. It currently covers an area more than three times as big. Nearshore currents and winds will carry D28 westwards. It's likely to take several years for it to break apart and melt completely. Follow Jonathan on Twitter.
The White House said the move was a response to "Russia's continued illegal intervention in Ukraine". Those targeted include Igor Sechin, head of oil giant Rosneft, and Sergei Chemezov of the hi-tech firm Rostec. The announcement comes after the mayor of Kharkiv, a city in eastern Ukraine, was shot and critically wounded. Hennadiy Kernes was recovering after an operation to repair damage to the chest and abdomen, but his life remained in danger, his office said. Mr Kernes used to be a supporter of former pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. He then dropped his support for Mr Yanukovych in favour of a united Ukraine. Monday also saw pro-Russian separatists seize a local government building in Kostyantynivka, a town in the eastern Donetsk region. In Donetsk itself, pro-Russian activists armed with clubs and chains attacked a pro-unity rally. A number of people were injured in the clash. Western countries accuse Russia of actively supporting the activists in Eastern Ukraine - a claim denied by Moscow. Separatists were also continuing to detain about 40 people in the town of Sloviansk, including journalists, pro-Kiev activists and seven military observers linked to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) as well as three members of Ukraine's security service, officials in Kiev said. At an OSCE meeting in Vienna, Russian ambassador Andrei Kelin said Moscow was taking "steps" to secure the observers' release. But the area around Sloviansk was very tense and it had been "extremely irresponsible" to send them there, he added. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon later called for the immediate and unconditional release of the observers. Separately, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu in a phone call with his US counterpart Chuck Hagel said Russian troops had returned to their permanent positions after conducting military exercises on the border with Ukraine. But he did not say whether the overall number of Russian troops deployed in the region - said to be around 40,000 - had been reduced. Meanwhile, Mr Hagel warned that Russia's continued aggression would result in more diplomatic and economic pressure. 'Additional costs' The US and EU first imposed visa bans and asset freezes on a number of senior Russian officials and companies after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine last month. On Thursday, the White House said it was adding to its sanctions list "in response to Russia's continued illegal intervention in Ukraine and provocative acts that undermine Ukraine's democracy". It accused Russia of "doing nothing to meet the commitments it made" at a meeting with Ukraine, the US and EU in Geneva on 17 April, which it said had included refraining from violence or provocative acts. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow's response would be "painful for Washington". He told the Interfax news agency the Kremlin was "disgusted" by the sanctions. Among the seven government officials facing a US asset freeze and visa ban, two are seen as long-time allies: Most of the 17 companies targeted are linked to Arkady and Boris Rotenberg and Gennady Timchenko - individuals targeted in the previous sanctions list. The latest measures also targets some hi-tech exports that "could contribute to Russia's military capabilities". Meanwhile, diplomats in Brussels said EU governments had reached a preliminary agreement to impose similar sanctions on another 15 people as part of expanded sanctions against Russia. The names are expected to be released on Tuesday.
The terms of the new oil contracts will be more favourable to foreign investors, who will be allowed a greater stake in long-term profits. Iran is gearing up for the lifting of sanctions following the nuclear deal with six world powers in July. The country has some of the biggest oil and gas reserves in the world. The new contracts were announced at a conference in Tehran attended by many of the world's major energy companies, including BP, Shell, Total, Statoil and Sinopec. There were, however, no US companies present. The energy majors are keen to exploit Iran's abundant reserves of oil. 'Not perfect' The new contracts put an end to the so-called buyback model, which has historically deterred foreign investors, where overseas contractors developed and operated an oil field before handing it over to Iran. Now, more lucrative longer-term contracts will be offered, where foreign companies can retain a stake in the field. About 50 oil and gas projects are expected to be unveiled during the Tehran conference, taking place on Saturday and Sunday. "The contract models introduced today are not perfect or ideal, but an effective and responsive model for both sides," Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said. "To continue to play a role [as a major oil supplier], we hope to enjoy working with reputable international oil companies under a win-win situation." Mr Zaganeh added that Iran had "no objection to or problem with the participation of US companies". Iran has big plans to increase oil production in the coming years, from about three million barrels a day now to five million by the end of the decade. It has already pledged to increase output by 500,000 barrels a day once sanctions are lifted.
By Jonathan WebbScience reporter, BBC News Professors Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura made the first blue LEDs in the early 1990s. This enabled a new generation of bright, energy-efficient white lamps, as well as colour LED screens. The winners will share prize money of eight million kronor (£0.7m). They were named at a press conference in Sweden, and join a prestigious list of 196 other Physics laureates recognised since 1901. Prof Nakamura, who was woken up in Japan to receive the news, told the press conference, "It's unbelievable." Making the announcement, the Nobel jury emphasised the usefulness of the invention, adding that the Nobel Prizes were established to recognise developments that delivered "the greatest benefit to mankind". "These uses are what would make Alfred Nobel very happy," said Prof Olle Inganas, a member of the prize committee from Linkoping University. The committee chair, Prof Per Delsing, from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, emphasised the winners' dedication. "What's fascinating is that a lot of big companies really tried to do this and they failed," he said. "But these guys persisted and they tried and tried again - and eventually they actually succeeded." Although red and green LEDs had been around for many years, blue LEDs were a long-standing challenge for scientists in both academia and industry. Without them, the three colours could not be mixed to produce the white light we now see in LED-based computer and TV screens. Furthermore, the high-energy blue light could be used to excite phosphorus and directly produce white light - the basis of the next generation of light bulb. Today, blue LEDs are found in people's pockets around the world, inside the lights and screens of smartphones. White LED lamps, meanwhile, deliver light to many offices and households. They use much less energy than both incandescent and fluorescent lamps. That improvement arises because LEDs convert electricity directly into photons of light, instead of the wasteful mixture of heat and light generated inside traditional, incandescent bulbs. Those bulbs use current to heat a wire filament until it glows, while the gas discharge inside fluorescent lamps also produces both heat and light. Inside an LED, current is applied to a sandwich of semiconductor materials, which emit a particular wavelength of light depending on the chemical make-up of those materials. Gallium nitride was the key ingredient used by the Nobel laureates in their ground-breaking blue LEDs. Growing big enough crystals of this compound was the stumbling block that stopped many other researchers - but Profs Akasaki and Amano, working at Nagoya University in Japan, managed to grow them in 1986 on a specially-designed scaffold made partly from sapphire. Four years later Prof Nakamura made a similar breakthrough, while he was working at the chemical company Nichia. Instead of a special substrate, he used a clever manipulation of temperature to boost the growth of the all-important crystals. Previous winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics 2013 - Francois Englert and Peter Higgs shared the prize for formulating the theory of the Higgs boson particle. 2012 - Serge Haroche and David J Wineland were awarded the prize for their work with light and matter. 2011 - The discovery that the expansion of the Universe was accelerating earned Saul Perlmutter, Brian P Schmidt and Adam Riess the physics prize. 2010 - Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov were awarded the prize for their discovery of the "wonder material" graphene. 2009 - Charles Kuen Kao won the physics Nobel for helping to develop fibre optic cables. In its award citation, the Nobel committee declared: "Incandescent light bulbs lit the 20th Century; the 21st Century will be lit by LED lamps." Commenting on the news, the president of the Institute of Physics, Dr Frances Saunders, emphasised that energy-efficient lamps form an important part of the effort to help slow carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. "With 20% of the world's electricity used for lighting, it's been calculated that optimal use of LED lighting could reduce this to 4%," she said. "Akasaki, Amano and Nakamura's research has made this possible. This is physics research that is having a direct impact on the grandest of scales, helping protect our environment, as well as turning up in our everyday electronic gadgets." LED lamps have the potential to help more than 1.5 billion people around the world who do not have access to electricity grids - because they are efficient enough to run on cheap, local solar power. At the University of Cambridge in the UK, Professor Sir Colin Humphreys also works on gallium nitride technology, including efforts to produce the crystals more cheaply and reduce the cost of LED lamps. He told BBC News he was thrilled by the Nobel announcement. "It pleases me greatly, because this is good science but it's also useful science. It's making a huge difference to energy savings. And I think some of the Nobel Prizes we have had recently - it will be years, if ever, before that science is usefully applied." Professor Ian Walmsley, a physicist at Oxford University, said the jury had made a "fantastic choice". "The ideas derive from some very important underpinning science developed over many years," he said, adding that the technology "makes new devices possible that are having, and will have, a huge impact on society, especially in displays and imaging".

By Paul RinconScience editor, BBC News website Jumping up and down on the spot before hugging the BBC's science editor David Shukman, her joy was emblematic of that felt by virtually all of the people who have worked for years to make this mission happen. "There are generations of people - managers who have replaced other managers - who were there to see this event. They've invested their entire lives in this mission," Rosetta's flamboyant project scientist Matt Taylor told the BBC after the landing. It's far too early to assess whether the mission has been a success - or otherwise. The probe took a decade to catch up with its target comet, travelling six billion km. Landing on one of these icy cosmic time capsules, with their meagre gravity and precarious terrain, was always going to be dicey. But it didn't help that two out of three mechanisms designed to help affix Philae to the surface failed. The probe appears to have bounced about one kilometre above the surface after first touching down. As I write, there are suggestions it may be lying at an angle, some way from the original landing zone so much time and effort was spent choosing. It may be on a slope, in the shadow of a cliff - which makes it difficult to get enough sunlight to charge its batteries. Whatever the outcome, and the science returned, there will always be questions about the costs of such missions and whether they can be justified in the current financial climate. On Twitter, Dr Taylor responded to just such a question by borrowing a catchphrase from A-Team actor Mr T: "I pity the fool." Thomas Reiter, director of human spaceflight and operations at Esa, acknowledged how the top line figure of 1.4bn euros appeared. But he explained: "If you divide it by the 20 years that the development and the mission has cost, it's about cents per European citizen per year that was contributing to this new knowledge." Four planes According to physicist Andrew Steele, who has calculated the costs on his website Scienceogram, the Rosetta mission cost 3.50 euros per person from 1996-2015. This works out at 0.20 euros per person per year. The same amount of money could buy four A380 planes. In the period since the mission was agreed, the Rosetta mission has created hundreds of jobs. The funding source for space missions like Rosetta comes from a subscription, paid by each of the 20 member states of the European Space Agency (Esa). In 2013, the UK paid a contribution of £240m to Esa's total budget of £3.3bn (4.2bn euros). Dr Sarah Main from the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case) points to the potential benefits that basic scientific enquiry - of the sort that Rosetta represents - can yield. "Forms of enquiry about the world around us, which we're summarising here as basic research, are vital to making changes to our society and our quality of life," she told BBC News. "Whether they come as a downstream effect of the building blocks of basic research work someone else has done, or in a more deliberately applied way. You can make parallels with cancer research: you can't design a new cancer drug unless you understand the mechanisms that cause cancer in a cell." Dr Main cites the example of the World Wide Web, which grew out of a system designed to help particle physicists at Cern communicate more effectively. "There are also a number of studies which assess the economic value of research in general. That's taking any type of research - as esoteric as you like - and adding it up to say: What does that deliver to the economy? "We see significant returns on investment from government putting funds into scientific research. It directly causes the economy to grow. One study showed it caused the economy to grow by 20% three years later." Mission facts: Philae lander Comet 67P Can you land on a comet? 'More black swan than yellow duck' Brief encounters with comets Indeed, as Oxford University astronomer Chris Lintott put it when quizzed on BBC Newsnight earlier this year: "The money doesn't go to the comet, the money's spent here on Earth. It goes to people, it goes on technology and it goes to industries in this country and throughout Europe." There is also the hope that such high profile events can inspire the young scientists and engineers of the future. A recent increase in numbers of A-level students taking physics at university was linked by some to better teaching, but others acknowledge a groundswell of popular interest in these subjects which may be fuelled by a greater profile in the media. But the Rosetta mission shouldn't be viewed as a recruiting tool alone. Thomas Reiter says the science designed to be carried out by the mission cuts to the very heart of the quest to understand where we come from. "It's to find answers to very fundamental questions about the history of our own planet, how it evolved... If life really emerged on Earth or if it might have been brought to Earth by such comets many billion of years in the past. "I think this is really worth it." Follow Paul on Twitter.
The promise of AI to solve human problems had to be matched with safeguards on how it was used, it said. The letter was drafted by the Future of Life Institute, which seeks to head off risks that could wipe out humanity. The letter comes soon after Prof Hawking warned that AI could "supersede" humans. Rampant AI AI experts, robot makers, programmers, physicists and ethicists and many others have signed the open letter penned by the non-profit institute. In it, the institute said there was now a "broad consensus" that AI research was making steady progress and because of this would have a growing impact on society. Research into AI, using a variety of approaches, had brought about great progress on speech recognition, image analysis, driverless cars, translation and robot motion, it said. Future AI systems had the potential to go further and perhaps realise such lofty ambitions as eradicating disease and poverty, it said. However, it warned, research to reap the rewards of AI had to be matched with an equal care to avoid the harm it could do. In the short term, this could mean research into the economic effects of AI to stop smart systems putting millions of people out of work. In the long term, it would mean researchers ensure that as AI is given control of our infrastructure, restraints are in place to limit the damage that would result if the system broke down. "Our AI systems must do what we want them to do," said the letter. The dangers of a rampant AI answerable only to itself and not its human creators was spelled out in early December by Prof Hawking when he said AI had the potential to "spell the end of the human race." Letting an artificially intelligent system guide its own development could be catastrophic, he warned in a BBC interview. "It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate," he said.
By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The work in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) looked at hundreds of trials involving nearly 340,000 patients to assess the merits of exercise and drugs in preventing death. Physical activity rivalled some heart drugs and outperformed stroke medicine. The findings suggest exercise should be added to prescriptions, say the researchers. Experts stressed that patients should not ditch their drugs for exercise - rather, they should use both in tandem. Prescriptions rise Too few adults currently get enough exercise. Only a third of people in England do the recommended 2.5 hours or more of moderate-intensity activity, such as cycling or fast walking, every week. In contrast, prescription drug rates continue to rise. There were an average of 17.7 prescriptions for every person in England in 2010, compared with 11.2 in 2000. For the study, scientists based at the London School of Economics, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care Institute at Harvard Medical School and Stanford University School of Medicine trawled medical literature to find any research that compared exercise with pills as a therapy. They identified 305 trials to include in their analysis. These trials looked at managing conditions such as existing heart disease, stroke rehabilitation, heart failure and pre-diabetes. When they studied the data as a whole, they found exercise and drugs were comparable in terms of death rates. But there were two exceptions. Drugs called diuretics were the clear winner for heart failure patients, while exercise was best for stroke patients in terms of life expectancy. Amy Thompson, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said that although an active lifestyle brings many health benefits, there is not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions about the merit of exercise above and beyond drugs. "Medicines are an extremely important part of the treatment of many heart conditions and people on prescribed drugs should keep taking their vital meds. If you have a heart condition or have been told you're at high risk of heart disease, talk to your doctor about the role that exercise can play in your treatment." Dr Peter Coleman of the Stroke Association said exercise alongside drugs had a vital role that merited more research. "We would like to see more research into the long-term benefits of exercise for stroke patients. "By taking important steps, such as regular exercise, eating a balanced diet and stopping smoking, people can significantly reduce their risk of stroke." "Moderate physical activity, for example, can reduce the risk of stroke by up to 27%."

President Donald Trump said the public deserved to be "fully informed" about the event, which has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. But some documents have been withheld at the request of government agencies. One memo revealed that the FBI had warned police of a death threat against the assassin Lee Harvey Oswald. "We at once notified the chief of police and he assured us Oswald would be given sufficient protection", writes the FBI director J Edgar Hoover. Oswald, a former Marine and self-proclaimed Marxist, was shot dead in the basement of the Dallas Police department two days after President Kennedy was killed. As the documents are pored over and analysed, other findings include a CIA memo that suggests Oswald spoke with a KGB officer at the Russian embassy in Mexico City. The memo says the KGB officer Oswald spoke with worked for a department "responsible for sabotage and assassination". Another memo showed that Soviet officials feared an "irresponsible general" would launch a missile at the USSR in the wake of President Kennedy's death. One memo tells how a British regional newspaper, the Cambridge News, received an anonymous call about "some big news" in the US, minutes before the assassination. A copy of the memo was released by the National Archives in the US in July, but had gone unreported. President Kennedy was shot dead on 22 November 1963 as he travelled through Dallas in an open-topped limousine. The Warren Commission's report into the shooting, published in September 1964, said that Lee Harvey Oswald had fired the fatal shots from the Texas School Book Depository building. JFK Files: The most interesting points There was "no evidence that either Lee Harvey Oswald or Jack Ruby was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign", the commission said. A 1992 law passed by Congress required all records related to the assassination - around five million pages - to be publicly disclosed in full within 25 years. The deadline was Thursday. More than 90% of the files were already in the public domain. Allegations of a government cover-up are unlikely to be assuaged by reports that the CIA, FBI, Department of State and other agencies lobbied at the last minute to keep certain documents under wraps. In a memo directing heads of executive departments to release the files, Mr Trump said the American public deserves to be "fully informed about all aspects of this pivotal event". "Therefore, I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted," the president wrote. Some redacted documents are undergoing a further six-month review, but it is possible those records could stay secret after the deadline on 26 April next year. The president, according to White House officials, was reluctant to agree to agency requests to hold the remaining documents. "I have no choice - today - but to accept those redactions rather than allow potentially irreversible harm to our Nation's security," Mr Trump added in his memo. The records have been released on the National Archives website.
By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent Taken by South African Brent Stirton, the picture shows the slumped form of a black rhino in Hluhluwe Imfolozi Game Reserve. Poachers killed the animal at night, with a silencer, and then dehorned it. Stirton took the photo as part of an investigation into the illegal trade in rhino products. The photographer visited more than 30 such crime scenes in the course of his probe - experiences he said he found depressing. "My first child is going to be born in February; I'm 48. And I think I left it such a long time because I kind of lost faith in a lot of the work we see as photojournalists. You lose faith in humanity to some extent." Stirton, who collected his award at a gala dinner at London's Natural History Museum, believes this particular piece of butchery was probably carried out by local people, but working to order. The usual practice is to sell the animal's two horns to a middleman. This individual then smuggles the merchandise out of South Africa, most probably through Mozambique, to China or Vietnam. In those Asian countries rhino horn has a street value higher than gold or cocaine. The trade is driven by the misguided belief that horn - the same material as toenails - can cure everything from cancer to kidney stones. Brent Stirton told BBC News: "For me to win this, for the jury to acknowledge this kind of picture - it's illustrative that we are living in a different time now, that this is a real issue. The sixth age of extinction is a reality and rhinos are just one of many species that we are losing at a hugely accelerated rate and I am grateful that the jury would choose this image because it gives this issue another platform." Lewis Blackwell, the chair of judges for WPY, said the rhino image had had a searing impact on his panel: "People may be disgusted, they may be horrified - but it draws you in and you want to know more, you want to know the story behind it. And you can't escape it; it confronts you with what's going on in the world." The rather more peaceful image of a young western lowland gorilla feeding on breadfruit is the subject of the Young Wildlife Photographer of the Year winning entry. This was taken by Daniël Nelson from the Netherlands, who entered the picture in the 15-17-years-old category. The gorilla is about nine years old and is called Caco by the trackers who took the young Dutchman to see the ape in Odzala National Park in the Republic of Congo. Western lowland gorillas are critically endangered. Their numbers are being denuded by illegal hunting for bushmeat, disease (notably the Ebola virus), and habitat loss (to mines and oil‑palm plantations). Daniël, who is now 18, said he first became aware of WPY when he was six. "It inspired me immediately, and since then my passions in life have revolved around wildlife, photography and conservation." Some of the other WPY category winners This image is called Contemplation, taken by Peter Delaney (Ireland/South Africa). It wins the Animal Portraits category. It shows a resting chimpanzee on the forest floor in Uganda's Kibale National Park. Peter is from County Wicklow but WPY inspired him to move to Africa to pursue his photography career. Crab surprise is the title of this picture from Justin Gilligan (Australia). It claimed the Invertebrates category. It shows an octopus choosing a meal in a field of giant spider crabs in Mercury Passage off the east coast of Tasmania. Tony Wu (US) calls this The giant gathering. It is the Behaviour: Mammals winner. Tony is a specialist in photographing sperm whales. This huge gathering was captured off Sri Lanka's northeast coast. Very rarely have such scenes been witnessed by cameras. This unusual photo is titled The ice monster. Laurent Ballesta (France) captured the scene in waters off East Antarctica, close to the French Dumont d'Urville scientific base. It shows the underside of an iceberg. It's actually a mosaic of many images stitched together. It won the Earth's Environments category. Palm-oil survivors is the work of Bertie Gekoski (UK/USA) - the winner of the Wildlife Photojournalist: Single image award. It is taken in eastern Sabah, on the island of Borneo. Three generations of Bornean elephants are seen moving across an oil-palm plantation being cleared for replanting. The palm oil industry has reduced and fragmented the animals' habitat. When the animals stray into plantations they often get shot or poisoned, says Bertie. The grip of the gulls, taken by Ekaterina Bee from Italy. Ekaterina is the winner in the 10 years and under category. She got these herring gulls to play for her camera by throwing some bread for them. Ekaterina is just five-and-a-half years old. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions of its type in world photography. Started in 1964 by what has since become BBC Wildlife Magazine, it has grown in scale and this year accepted 48,000 entries from 92 countries. The current competition is organised by London's Natural History Museum. An exhibition of the best images opens at the South Kensington institution on Friday. Next year's competition starts taking entries from Monday. Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos
Rezaian, 39, was jailed on charges, including espionage, last November. The United States said it was offering clemency to seven Iranians being held in the US for sanctions violation. On Saturday evening, after talks in Vienna, international sanctions on Iran were lifted as part of the nuclear deal agreed last year. The lifting of the sanctions was announced by EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. Three of the US citizens - Rezaian, Saeed Abedini and Amir Hekmati - were released from prison on Saturday and were flown to Switzerland then to Germany on Sunday. They were expected to receive medical treatment at a US base there. A fourth, Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari, did not fly with them, US officials said. US citizens released by Iran The four prisoners are all dual US-Iran citizens. Jason Rezaian: aged 39, Tehran correspondent for the Washington Post. Detained in Iran for more than a year before his sentencing last November. Saeed Abedini: aged 35, a Christian pastor who had been imprisoned since July 2012 for organising churches in people's houses. Amir Hekmati: aged 32, former Marine who spent more than four years in prison on spying charges following his arrest in August 2011 during a visit to see his grandmother. Nosratollah Khosravi-Roodsari: Little is known about the fourth US citizen. Iranian citizens released by the US Of the seven Iranian citizens being released, six are also citizens of the US. The Iranian state news agency listed them as: Nader Modanlo, Bahram Mechanic, Khosrow Afghani, Arash Ghahreman, Tooraj Faridi, Nima Golestaneh and Ali Saboun. They are all accused or convicted of violating US sanctions on Iran. A US official said a diplomatic channel was established "with the focus of getting our detained US citizens home". "Iran has also committed to continue co-operating with the United States to determine the whereabouts of Robert Levinson," the official said. According to the Associated Press news agency, Mr Levinson is a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran in 2007 while working for the CIA on an unapproved intelligence mission. A further 14 Iranians sought by the US would be removed from an Interpol wanted list, the US and Iran said. A fifth American, writer and student Matthew Trevithick, was also released from jail in Iran on Saturday, but his release was not part of the prisoner exchange. His family said in a statement published on the Iran Primer website that he had been held at Evin prison in Tehran for 40 days. He had been studying languages in Iran, they said. Analysis: Sebastian Usher, Middle East Editor, BBC World Service For months after his arrest in 2014, there was uncertainty over what accusations Jason Rezaian was facing. He was held in the notorious Evin prison before finally being found guilty on charges that his lawyer said included espionage. His newspaper vigorously denied this. President Barack Obama said he would not rest until he was freed. Now, his release has been announced in what Iran calls a prisoner swap - an indication he might have been used as a bargaining chip. His release removes a shadow that had lain over relations between Tehran and Washington even as they were thawing with the nuclear deal. Jason Rezaian - Now a free man The media freedom organisation Reporters Without Borders welcomed Rezaian's release, saying he "was just doing his job as a reporter and was unlucky enough to have dual US and Iranian nationality at a time when the two countries were conducting tense negotiations about Iran's nuclear programme". "We are thrilled to see Jason finally free, but he should have never been imprisoned in the first place. Jason was innocent. It is outrageous that he has been used as a bargaining chip," said Christophe Deloire, the organisation's secretary general.
The suit was filed by Rivera's ex-husband and on behalf of her estate over the accident on a California lake. It blames the local authority and the managers of Lake Piru, north-west of Los Angeles, where the accident happened. It alleges swimmers were not adequately warned of the risks of swimming there. The late 33-year-old actress was best known for playing cheerleader Santana Lopez in Glee. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of her son by Rivera's ex-husband and the boy's father, Ryan Dorsey. It alleges that the boat rented by Rivera was "not equipped with a safely accessible ladder, adequate rope, an anchor, a radio, or any security mechanisms to prevent swimmers from being separated from their boats". It also said it did not have any flotation devices. It also alleges there were no warning signs at the lake alerting swimmers to potentially dangerous conditions such as strong currents, low visibility and changing water depths. The local authorities have not yet commented on the lawsuit. Rivera had rented a pontoon boat with her son - aged four at the time of the accident - at Lake Piru on 8 July. The child was found alone and asleep in the boat by a leasing agent after it was not returned, prompting a search for the actress. Her body was found a few days later and her death was later declared to have been accidental. Who was Naya Rivera? Rivera began her career as a child actress and model, appearing in TV commercials in the US. As a four-year-old, she starred in the Royal Family sitcom on CBS and had a number of other TV appearances. But it was playing cold-hearted Santana Lopez in Glee that made her a star. Glee, the musical comedy TV series, ran on the Fox network from 2009 to 2015. In 2014, Rivera starred in the horror film At the Devil's Door. The same year she married fellow actor Ryan Dorsey - who is the father of her son. When the couple divorced in 2018, they were granted joint custody.
The US tech giant sold 74.8 million iPhones in its fiscal first quarter, compared with 74.5 million a year ago. Apple said revenue for the next quarter would be between $50bn (£34bn; €46bn) and $53bn, below the $58bn it reported for the same period a year ago. This would mark Apple's first fall in revenues since it launched the iPhone. Despite first-quarter iPhone sales being below the 75 million expected by analysts, it was still a record quarter for the company. Apple revenue in the three months to 26 December was $75.9bn and net profit was $18.4bn, both of which are the highest ever recorded by the company. Sales of iPhones accounted for 68% of the company's revenue in the period. Analysis By Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent Any other company announcing record profits and revenues might expect a warm welcome from investors. But now that Apple has scaled so many peaks the worry is that the only way is down - and there's evidence in these figures to back up those concerns. Sales of the iPhone, surely the single most profitable product any company has produced, were basically flat. What's more, the revenue outlook for the next three months indicates we can expect the first fall in sales since the iPhone's 2007 launch. Then there's China - still growing but far more slowly. The iPhone is still an object of desire there, but at a time when Apple says it's seeing softness in the economy, the attractions of cheaper rivals from local firms like Xiaomi may grow. Of course, the worries about "peak iPhone" have surfaced before and evaporated with the hugely successful iPhone 6. Last year's upgrade to the 6S was a minor one, and we can expect something more radical in September. But the pressure is now mounting on Apple to deliver another blockbuster product to keep the profit engine running. The Apple watch will not fill that role - we've still not even heard any sales figures for the product. Perhaps the 1,000 engineers rumoured to be working on an Apple Car will come up with the exciting innovation which Apple's fans and investors await with growing impatience. Is the mighty iPhone in decline? Chinese 'softness not seen before' Apple boss Tim Cook credited "all-time record sales of iPhone, Apple Watch and Apple TV" for the performance. But the firm's chief financial officer, Luca Maestri, said the company was operating in "a very difficult macroeconomic environment". He added that "iPhone units will decline in the quarter" and that the company was not projecting beyond those three months. Mr Maestri partly blamed the strong US dollar for Apple's flat sales, estimating it had knocked $5bn off the company's revenues. Apple's sales in Greater China - defined by the company as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - rose 14%, but that was much slower than the 70% increase a year ago. Mr Maestri said the softness in China was "something that we have not seen before", Reuters reported. 'Mother of all balance sheets' China accounts for almost a quarter of Apple's sales, more than all of Europe combined. The profitability of Apple's business improved, with gross margin - or how much the company makes per product - increasing to 40.1%. Geoff Blaber, an analyst at CCS Insight, said Apple was "generating industry defying margins" and had cash of almost $216bn. Speaking to analysts, Mr Cook said the company had "the mother of all balance sheets" and that its financial position had never been stronger. Apple's shares were down 2.7% in after hours trading at $97.28. Daniel Ives, an analyst at Capital Markets who owns shares in Apple, said given the "white knuckles fears" ahead of the results, he would "characterise the overall headline performance as better than feared".
A box containing jewellery worth up to €6m (£5.2m; $6.7m) was among items taken, a police spokesman said. The concierge led the gunmen to the residence where they tied Kardashian West up in the bathroom, police said. A spokeswoman for the star said she was "badly shaken but physically unharmed". The mother-of-two - who became a household name thanks to the reality series Keeping up with the Kardashians - has now left France, flying out of a Paris airport aboard a private jet. A police source has told the BBC the attack was carried out by five men, wearing police-style jackets, who forced the building's overnight security guard to show them where Kardashian West was staying. Once inside, one of the men put a gun to her head while they robbed her of jewellery including a ring worth €4m, then tied her up and locked her in a bathroom while they escaped. According to the police officer, the men fled the scene on bicycles. They also stole a box of jewellery worth as much as €6m (£5.2m/$6.7m), AP reported, citing police officials. The star's spokeswoman, Ina Treciokas, told CNN the robbery had been carried out by masked men with guns. Police sources told the Associated Press news agency that they were seeking five assailants, two of whom had forced their way into the house. The robbery took place at about 02:30 local time (00:30 GMT), police said. The celebrity 'prankster' speaks out Kardashian celebrity prankster - or harasser? Robbery no joke say social media users Prank was over 'butt implants' Gigi Hadid hits back Five brazen ways bling was bagged Kardashian West's husband, the rapper Kanye West, was on stage at the Meadows Music and Arts Festival in New York at the time of the robbery. He abruptly ended his set, telling fans: "I'm sorry, family emergency. I have to stop the show." Kardashian West stayed at the luxury residence, in a discreet building behind the city's Madeleine church, with several secret entrances, at least once before, in 2014 before her marriage to West. A stay can cost as much as €15,000 a night. TV host James Corden criticised those making light of the incident. He tweeted: "People making jokes about Kim Kardashian tonight would do well to remember that she's a mother, a daughter, a wife, a friend. Be nice or shut up." It is unclear if the couple's two children, three-year-old daughter North and 10-month-old son Saint, were at the home at the time. Police were guarding the site on Monday. The star was in Paris for the city's fashion week with her mother Kris Jenner and her sister Kendall Jenner. Last week she was approached by a prankster who tried to kiss her bottom but was stopped by a bodyguard. Kardashian West first rose to fame as a friend and stylist to Paris Hilton. She later appeared in her own reality programme, Keeping up with the Kardashians, about her family.
The future of the former guesthouse has been widely debated, with opinion torn between razing it or changing its use. The argument was further complicated after its owner refused to sell. But Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka said a committee of experts had decided that the house should be demolished, reported Austrian newspaper Die Presse. A new building put in its place will be used for administrative or for charitable purposes, the paper added (in German). "The Hitler house will be torn down. The foundations can remain but a new building will be erected. It will be be used by either a charity or the local authorities," Mr Sobotka told Die Presse. The house has been the subject of years of legal wrangling between the owner Gerlinde Pommer and the government, which has been renting it since 1972 to prevent any misuse. It currently pays about €4,800 ($5,300; £4,336) a month for the building in Braunau am Inn . Ms Pommer who is now retired, has repeatedly refused to sell the three-storey building to the government. For the last five years it has also stood empty, as she refused to allow renovation work to be done. The building had previously been used as a centre for people with disabilities. An interior ministry spokesman told AFP a legal amendment proposed earlier this year which would allow them to seize the property was still "under way", meaning parliament has yet to approve the demolition. However, the decision will likely upset some in the community, some who wanted it to become a refugee centre, others a museum dedicated to Austria's liberation from Nazi rule. A number of cultural organisations previously opposed the building's demolition because it is part of the historic city centre and therefore under heritage protection. Hitler was born in a rented room on the top floor of the building, near the Austro-German border, on 20 April 1889. During Nazi rule, the house was transformed into a shrine to Hitler as the town drew in a wave of tourists. But as the Nazis began to lose control in 1944, it was shut up. Yet despite the efforts of successive governments to stop it drawing neo-Nazis sympathisers to Braunau am Inn, locals say it still does. "I've even witnessed people from Italy or from France coming here… for adoration purposes," Josef Kogler, a teacher in Braunau, told the BBC. "One Frenchman, a history teacher I think it was, came and asked me for Hitler's birthplace… It's hard to understand."
The footage shows a group wearing orange overalls being forced to the ground and then decapitated. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has said Egypt reserves the right to respond in any way it sees fit. IS militants claim to have carried out several attacks in Libya, which is in effect without a government. However, with many armed groups operating in Libya, it is not clear how much power IS actually wields. National mourning The kidnapped Egyptian workers, all Coptic Christians, were seized in December and January from the coastal town of Sirte in eastern Libya, now under the control of Islamist groups. The video of the beheadings was posted online by Libyan jihadists who pledge loyalty to IS. A caption made it clear the men were targeted because of their faith. "Egypt and the whole world are in a fierce battle with extremist groups carrying extremist ideology and sharing the same goals," President Sisi said. The beheadings were described as "barbaric" by al-Azhar, the highly regarded theological institution which is based in Egypt. The Coptic church said it was "confident" Egypt would exact retribution. Egypt has declared seven days of national mourning. Libya has been in turmoil since 2011 and the overthrow of its then-leader, Col Muammar Gaddafi. Since then, numerous other militia groups have battled for control. The head of the US Defense Intelligence Agency warned last month that IS was assembling "a growing international footprint that includes ungoverned and under-governed areas", including Libya. Analysis - Orla Guerin, BBC News, Cairo The five-minute video shows hostages in orange jumpsuits being marched along a beach, each accompanied by a masked militant. The men are made to kneel before they are simultaneously beheaded. Most were from a poor village in Upper Egypt where some relatives fainted on hearing the news. A caption accompanying the video made it clear the hostages were targeted because of their faith. It referred to the victims as "people of the cross, followers of the hostile Egyptian church". There's speculation here that Egypt may now consider airstrikes across the border. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has said in the past that militants in Libya are a danger not just to Egypt, but also to the Middle East. Rival governments Libya has two rival governments, one based in Tripoli, the other in Tobruk. Meanwhile, the eastern city of Benghazi, headquarters of the 2011 revolution, is largely in the hands of Islamist fighters, some with links to al-Qaeda. On Sunday, Italy closed its embassy in Tripoli. Italy, the former colonial power, lies less than 500 miles (750km) from Libya at the shortest sea crossing point. Italian Premier Matteo Renzi has been calling for the UN to intervene in Libya. Thousands of migrants use the Libyan coast as a starting point to flee the violence and attempt to reach the EU. UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond condemned the beheadings. "Such barbaric acts strengthen our determination to work with our partners to counter the expanding terrorist threat to Libya and the region," he said. On Sunday, President Sisi banned all travel to Libya by Egyptian citizens. Despite the turmoil in Libya, thousands of Egyptians go to the country looking for work. There had been demonstrations in Egypt calling on the government to do more to secure the release of those held.
The gallery said it had been involved in discussions about acquiring some items from her wardrobe. But it said it only collected items of "outstanding aesthetic or technical quality" and no formal offer was made. More than 300 items will now be sold at auction next month instead. Lady Thatcher died two and a half years ago. She was the longest-serving premier of the 20th Century and Britain's only female prime minister to date. The clothes to be auctioned by Christie's include her blue velvet wedding dress and various power suits worn during her tenure in Downing Street, plus handbags and jewellery. A spokesperson for the museum told The Daily Telegraph: "The V&A politely declined the offer of Baroness Thatcher's clothes, feeling that these records of Britain's political history were best suited to another collection which would focus on their intrinsic social historical value. "The museum is responsible for chronicling fashionable dress and its collecting policy tends to focus on acquiring examples of outstanding aesthetic or technical quality." The museum later issued a further statement saying: "We were asked a question on Monday about an informal discussion that happened several years ago and responded accordingly. "No formal offer of this collection has yet been made to the Museum or discussed at a senior level or with Trustees." The museum added: "The V&A is a constantly evolving institution, and if we were approached today it is perfectly possible that discussions might develop in a different direction." Business Secretary Sajid Javid tweeted: "Shame the V&A has turned down Thatcher's personal collection. I for one would have loved to see it!" In recent years the museum, which described itself as "the world's leading museum of art and design", has put on crowd-pleasing shows of fashion by designer Alexander McQueen and clothes worn by pop legend David Bowie.
By Paradise Papers reporting team BBC Panorama Donald Trump's commerce secretary is shown to have a stake in a firm dealing with Russians sanctioned by the US. The leak, dubbed the Paradise Papers, contains 13.4m documents, mostly from one leading firm in offshore finance. BBC Panorama is part of nearly 100 media groups investigating the papers. Follow live updates As with last year's Panama Papers leak, the documents were obtained by the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, which called in the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) to oversee the investigation. The Guardian is also among the organisations investigating the documents. Sunday's revelations form only a small part of a week of disclosures that will expose the tax and financial affairs of some of the hundreds of people and companies named in the data, some with strong UK connections. Many of the stories focus on how politicians, multinationals, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals use complex structures of trusts, foundations and shell companies to protect their cash from tax officials or hide their dealings behind a veil of secrecy. The vast majority of the transactions involve no legal wrongdoing. Other key stories released on Sunday were: The other media partners may be covering different stories affecting their regions. How is the Queen involved? The Paradise Papers show that about £10m ($13m) of the Queen's private money was invested offshore. It was put into funds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda by the Duchy of Lancaster, which provides the Queen with an income and handles investments for her £500m private estate. There is nothing illegal in the investments and no suggestion that the Queen is avoiding tax, but questions may be asked about whether the monarch should be investing offshore. There were small investments in the rent-to-buy retailer BrightHouse, which has been accused of exploiting the poor, and the Threshers chain of off-licences, which later went bust owing £17.5m in tax and costing almost 6,000 people their jobs. The Duchy said it was not involved in decisions made by funds and there is no suggestion the Queen had any knowledge of the specific investments made on her behalf. The Duchy has in the past said it gives "ongoing consideration regarding any of its acts or omissions that could adversely impact the reputation" of the Queen, who it says takes "a keen interest" in the estate. The BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell says it is extraordinary and puzzling that the Queen's advisers could have felt that it was appropriate - for somebody whose reputation is based so much on setting a good example - to invest in these offshore funds. Questions will now be being asked inside Buckingham Palace about how that decision was made, he added. Read the full story here Embarrassment for Ross and Trump? Wilbur Ross helped stave off bankruptcy for Donald Trump in the 1990s and was later appointed commerce secretary in Mr Trump's administration. The documents reveal Mr Ross has retained an interest in a shipping company which earns millions of dollars a year transporting oil and gas for a Russian energy firm whose shareholders include Vladimir Putin's son-in-law and two men subject to US sanctions. It will again raise questions about the Russian connections of Donald Trump's team. His presidency has been dogged by allegations that Russians colluded to try to influence the outcome of last year's US election. He has called the allegations "fake news". Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal has called for an investigation, telling NBC News that Mr Ross had given Congress the impression he no longer held shares in the shipping company. "Our committee was misled, the American people were misled by the concealment of those companies." Read the full story here Questions for the UK government Opposition politicians have said the government must stop "dragging its feet" and curb the use of offshore tax havens, and Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has called for a public inquiry. But at the CBI conference on Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May did not commit to a public inquiry. She also did not directly answer when asked whether she would insist on British overseas territories publishing a list of who owns companies and trusts registered in crown dependencies. She said the UK government was working with its dependences "to ensure we're seeing greater transparency." Where does the leak come from? Most of the data comes from a company called Appleby, a Bermuda-founded legal services provider at the top end of the offshore industry, helping clients set up in overseas jurisdictions with low or zero tax rates. Its documents, and others mainly from corporate registries in Caribbean jurisdictions, were obtained by Süddeutsche Zeitung. It has not revealed the source. The media partners say the investigation is in the public interest because data leaks from the world of offshore have repeatedly exposed wrongdoing. In response to the leaks, Appleby said it was "satisfied that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, either on the part of ourselves or our clients", adding: "We do not tolerate illegal behaviour." Read the Appleby story here What exactly is offshore finance? Essentially it's about a place outside of your own nation's regulations to which companies or individuals can reroute money, assets or profits to take advantage of lower taxes. These jurisdictions are known as tax havens to the layman, or the more stately offshore financial centres (OFCs) to the industry. They are generally stable, secretive and reliable, often small islands but not exclusively so, and can vary on how rigorously they carry out checks on wrongdoing. The UK is a big player here, not simply because so many of its overseas territories and Crown dependencies are OFCs, but many of the lawyers, accountants and bankers working in the offshore industry are in the City of London. It's also about the mega-rich. Brooke Harrington, author of Capital Without Borders: Wealth Managers and the One Percent, says offshore finance is not for the 1% but the .001%. Assets of around $500,000 (£380,000) would just not meet the offshore fees the schemes would need, she says. Are we taming offshore? What is the effect on us and should we care? Well, it is a lot of cash. The Boston Consulting Group says $10tn is held offshore. That's about the equivalent of the gross domestic products of the UK, Japan and France - combined. It may also be a conservative estimate. Critics of offshore say it is mainly about secrecy - which opens the door to wrongdoing - and inequality. They also say the action of governments to curb it has often been slow and ineffective. Brooke Harrington says if the rich are avoiding tax, the poor pick up the bill: "There's a minimal amount the governments need to function and they recoup what they lose from the rich and from corporations by taking it out of our hides." Meg Hillier, UK Labour MP and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, told Panorama: "We need to see what's going offshore; if offshore was not secret then some of this stuff just couldn't happen... we need transparency and we need sunlight shone on this." Your guide to a history of financial leaks What is the defence of offshore? The offshore financial centres say that if they did not exist, there would be no constraint on taxes governments might levy. They say they do not sit on hoards of cash, but act as agents that help pump money around the globe. Bob Richards, who was Bermuda's finance minister when Panorama interviewed him for its programme, said it was not up to him to collect other nations' taxes and that they should sort themselves out. Both he and Howard Quayle, the chief minister for the Isle of Man, who was also interviewed for Panorama and whose Crown dependency plays a big part in the leaks, denied their jurisdictions could even be considered tax havens as they were well regulated and fully conformed to international financial reporting rules. Appleby itself has in the past said OFCs "protect people victimised by crime, corruption, or persecution by shielding them from venal governments".

Ms Trierweiler left Pitie Salpetriere hospital for the presidential residence at La Lanterne in Versailles. Ms Trierweiler later tweeted to say she was "very touched" by all the messages of support she had received. Closer magazine had alleged the liaison between Mr Hollande and Julie Gayet. It said that the affair had begun during the 2012 presidential race. 'Difficult moment' Ms Gayet, 41, says she is suing Closer for breach of privacy, seeking 50,000 euros (£41,000; $68,000) in damages and 4,000 euros in legal costs. Ms Trierweiler, 48, works for Paris Match magazine, which said she was planning to rest at La Lanterne. Mr Hollande has not commented on the latest news. However, a source at the presidential office told Agence France-Presse news agency that Ms Trierweiler would stay at La Lanterne "for a few days". Ms Trierweiler later tweeted: "Thank you from the bottom of my heart to all those who have sent messages of support and for my recovery - by Twitter, SMS or email. Very touched." Ms Trierweiler had been admitted to hospital on 10 January, in a reported state of shock at the allegations. Mr Hollande visited her for the first time on Thursday evening. French media have claimed that Ms Trierweiler suffered an anxiety attack last week, but her friends have played down her condition. At his annual news conference on Tuesday at the Elysee to discuss his political agenda, Mr Hollande was asked questions about the alleged affair. Mr Hollande, 59, said he was experiencing a "difficult moment" in his private life but refused to answer questions over the report in Closer, saying "private matters should be dealt with privately". Nor would he clarify whether Ms Trierweiler was still first lady before a February trip to the US.
Mark Thompson says he has emails which show that trust members, including the chairman Lord Patten and a senior BBC boss, approved the payments. The BBC has been criticised for paying £2m more than contracts necessitated. The BBC Trust says the claims are bizarre and it denied MPs were misled. In a letter to MPs investigating the issue, Mr Thompson says statements by the trust's chairman were inaccurate, information was kept from the National Audit Office and the head of human resources misled MPs over her involvement. 'Bizarre' statement The 13,000-word document was prepared ahead of his appearance before the Public Accounts Committee on Monday, where he will be expected to answer allegations made in July that he had not been open with the trust about pay-offs to two senior executives. The document included a briefing note prepared for Lord Patten on defending the size of the payments. Another attachment challenged the BBC head of human resources Lucy Adams' claim that she did not know of an email explaining the pay-offs, and appeared to show that she helped to compose it. He also claims the trust did not reveal its full involvement with the pay-offs to the National Audit Office. Media commentator Steve Hewlett said the letter raises "serious questions". He said Lord Patten's position could be called into question "if Mr Thompson's argument prevails". Mr Hewlett added that if it appears that Mr Thompson, who is now chief executive of the New York Times "where executive ethics are a top drawer issue, has misled the Trust, then it is going to be very difficult for him". The BBC Trust said: "We reject the suggestion that Lord Patten and Anthony Fry misled the PAC [Public Accounts Committee]. "We completely disagree with Mark Thompson's analysis, much of which is unsubstantiated." It added that it was looking forward to putting its side of the case to the Public Accounts Committee next week. The hearing is a follow-up to that which took place in July and saw Lord Patten tell MPs he was "shocked and dismayed" by pay-offs totalling £25m to senior managers. He said that if Mr Thompson was called before MPs, he would be "as interested as you are, why we didn't know". Lord Patten said he had "no concerns at all" about the statements made by Mr Thompson and was "looking forward" to appearing before the PAC on Monday. Speaking outside his home on Friday, he said it was "very curious" that Mr Thompson should focus on the £949,000 payout to his deputy, Mark Byford, as that happened before he became chairman of BBC Trust. Mark Thompson has said previously that the BBC Trust knew about the severance payment to Mr Byford, which included £73,000 for unused leave, saying they had been told "in writing, as well as orally". It is understood the outgoing BBC HR director Lucy Adams will also give evidence at Monday's hearing.
By Ian YoungsEntertainment reporter, BBC News Vigils have been held in New York, where the music legend was shot dead, and his home city of Liverpool. "I really do feel like I got a sense of peace here tonight," said Adam Byrne, 34, from Liverpool. "I think his message is still as strong as ever." His widow Yoko Ono played a concert in Tokyo, while gatherings have also taken place in cities from Prague to Havana. The musician was 40 years old when he was killed by crazed fan Mark Chapman outside the Dakota Building in Manhattan. In Liverpool, several hundred people with candles and glowsticks braved cold temperatures to sing Lennon songs and listen to poetry inspired by the late Beatle. The vigil was held next to a peace monument that was unveiled by his first wife Cynthia and son Julian in October and has been dedicated to John Lennon. A giant photograph of John with Julian watched over the crowd, alongside a banner bearing the name of one of John's signature songs, Give Peace A Chance. "That message is still loud and clear today as much now as it was then," said Mr Byrne. "It's nice to see that people still remember John and we still carry a piece of John with us. Peace is possible." Chris McIver, from the Wirral, said it was a "very nice, peaceful, happy evening". "We're here just to remember John and to reflect on the night that we heard the news ourselves, to think of John and to celebrate." Mr McIver recalled hearing the news of Lennon's death on TV. "I just couldn't believe it," he said. "I remember just going into the lounge, sitting on a chair and I couldn't move for about an hour. I was in complete shock." Phil Hanson, another fan in Liverpool's Chavasse Park, described the atmosphere as "lovely, warm and loving". "He's one of my idols," he said. "John Lennon saved my life. I've even got a tattoo of him on my arm." In New York, hundreds of fans gathered in Central Park, near the spot where Lennon was shot. Flowers were laid in the Strawberry Fields area, which was converted to a memorial garden after his death. Ono performed at a charity concert in Japan called Dream Power John Lennon Super Live, which raises money for schools for deprived children all over the world. "On this tragic anniversary please join me in remembering John with deep love and respect," she said in a statement. "In his short lived life of 40 years, he has given so much to the world. The world was lucky to have known him. "We still learn so much from him today. John, I love you!" Their son Sean, now a musician, used Twitter to respond to the tributes to his father. "Thank you for all the kind words," he said. "Let's all just pray for peace on earth. That's what he cared about most."

New York dealer William Acquavella said Freud had died at his London home on Wednesday after an unspecified illness. Freud, a grandson of the psycho-analyst Sigmund Freud, was born in Berlin in 1922 and fled to Britain with his Jewish family in 1933, when he was 10. Freud - particularly known for his paintings of nudes - became a British citizen in 1939. His works have been increasingly sought after at recent auctions and his portrayal of an overweight nude woman sleeping on a couch sold in 2008 for $33.6m (£20.6m) - a world record for a work by a living artist. 'Lived to paint' Mr Acquavella described Freud "as one of the great painters of the 20th Century". "In company he was exciting, humble, warm and witty. He lived to paint and painted until the day he died, far removed from the noise of the art world." Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate gallery, said: "The vitality of [Freud's] nudes, the intensity of the still life paintings and the presence of his portraits of family and friends guarantee Lucian Freud a unique place in the pantheon of late 20th Century art. "His early paintings redefined British art and his later works stand comparison with the great figurative painters of any period." Former Observer art critic William Feaver, who knew Freud for more than 40 years, said Freud was someone who had "restored portraiture to its proper place", by focusing on all types of people, not just successful businessmen and their wives. "He said everything he did was autobiographical and a self portrait. He was a witty, impulsive artist but generous with it." Mr Feaver said Freud had left several unfinished paintings. He said: "He always liked to keep a couple of paintings on the go in case he dropped off the twig and I know he's done that." Former muse Sue Tilley, who sat for the nude Benefits Supervisor Sleeping, said she had "fantastic experiences" while posing for the portrait. "I found out last night on Twitter, bizarrely, and I did start crying," she told BBC Breakfast. "I haven't seen him for a long time and he's not really a close friend now but it's a part of my life that's kind of gone." Order of Merit Freud, the son of an architect and older brother of the late broadcaster Clement Freud, went to the Central School of Art, in London and then to the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing and London's Goldsmiths College. At first he confined himself to drawing, but when he was 17 had a self-portrait accepted for reproduction in the magazine, Horizon. Freud was recognised early on and after a spell in the Merchant Navy in 1942, had his first one-man show in 1944, when he was 21. After the war he went to France and Greece, and having taken up painting by then, returned to the UK in 1948 to teach for 10 years at the Slade School of Art. Freud was married twice, first to sculptor Jacob Epstein's daughter, Kitty, the subject of his celebrated Girl With a White Dog. His second wife was the daughter of the Marquess of Dufferin and Ava. Freud's other key works include Naked Girl Asleep and Reflection (self portrait). The Queen and supermodel Kate Moss are among those to have sat for the artist. Freud was a member of the Order of Merit, one of Britain's most prestigious chivalry honours presented to individuals by the Queen for great achievement in the fields of the arts, learning, literature and science. The honour is restricted to 24 members at any one time, plus additional foreign recipients and past recipients include Florence Nightingale, Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Edward Elgar and Mother Teresa.
Some 3,000 people, including nearly 200 divers, as well as ships, planes, helicopters and submersibles are involved in the operation near Sochi. Some plane fragments have been found, including fuselage and tail parts. The Tu-154 plane carrying soldiers, army musicians and reporters was heading for Syria. All on board are feared dead after Sunday's crash. A national day of mourning was observed across Russia on Monday. First body identified At a briefing late on Monday, Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said that a fuselage fragment with windows had been found and brought to the shore. He also said that a tail part with "engine fragments" had been discovered underwater. The spokesman added that another body was recovered on Monday. Earlier, search teams had found 11 bodies, but officials believe many more may be trapped inside the remains of the aircraft. Maj Gen Konashenkov also said that one of the retrieved bodies had been identified, without providing further details. Search teams worked through the day , and the operation was continuing round the clock, the spokesman added. The 10.5 sq km (four sq mile) search area just off the coast had been extended, he added. Emergency Situations Minister Vladimir Puchkov said that the plane's "black box" flight recorders, situated in the tail of the aircraft, had not yet been retrieved. Transport Minister Maksim Sokolov said that terrorism was not "among the main versions" of the possible causes of the crash. He reiterated that investigators were looking into whether pilot error or a technical fault may have brought down the aircraft. The plane disappeared from radar two minutes after taking off from Sochi's Adler airport at 05:25 (02:25 GMT) on Sunday, heading for Latakia in Syria, the defence ministry said. The flight had originated in Moscow and landed in Sochi for refuelling. It was carrying 64 members of the famed Alexandrov military music ensemble, who were to perform for Russian troops in Syria. What is the Alexandrov Ensemble? An audio recording played on Russian media and said to be of the final conversation between air traffic controllers and the plane reveals no sign of any difficulties. Voices remain calm until the plane disappears and the controllers try in vain to re-establish contact. The plane came into service in 1983. Gen Konashenkov said the aircraft was last serviced in September and had undergone more substantial repairs in December 2014. It had an "experienced" pilot, he said. The defence ministry has published a passenger list (in Russian). As well as the Alexandrov Ensemble, those on board included nine journalists, eight soldiers, two civil servants and eight crew members. Among the victims was Yelizaveta Glinka, known as Dr Liza, the executive director of the Fair Aid charity and the inaugural winner of Russia's state prize for achievements in human rights. The Alexandrov Ensemble was scheduled to perform a New Year's concert at Russia's Hmeimim air base near Latakia. Russia has been carrying out air strikes in support of Syrian government forces who are battling rebels opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Tupolev-154: Russian workhorse
Mr Yee, 18, has been detained in the US since he arrived at Chicago's O'Hare airport in December. He came into the country on a tourist visa but told immigration officials he was seeking refuge. Following Friday's ruling, he is expected to be released shortly. The US Department of Homeland Security opposed Mr Yee's asylum application, but the immigration judge ruled in the teenager's favour. Judge Samuel Cole released a 13-page decision, which said Mr Yee faced persecution in Singapore for his political opinions. "Yee has met his burden of showing that he suffered past persecution on account of his political opinion and has a well-founded fear of future persecution in Singapore," Judge Coel ruled. "Accordingly, this court grants his application for asylum." Celebration and sympathy - Tessa Wong, BBC News Online, Singapore Amos Yee is not the only one celebrating his US asylum win - many Singaporeans are pleased as well. "Finally... hopefully it is the last we have heard of him," a Facebook user wrote in one typical comment online. The teenage critic is one of Singapore's most controversial figures, where he is viewed with exasperation but also a measure of sympathy. Singapore is known for its strict rules on free speech, especially when it comes to race and religion - rules which the US judge said have been used by the authorities to constrain dissent, but which many in the city-state support. Following Mr Yee's explosive remarks about the country's deeply-revered late leader Lee Kuan Yew and Christianity, Mr Yee had continued to fall foul of the law by breaching bail conditions and making further critical comments about religion. Even by leaving Singapore he has committed an offence, as he is avoiding mandatory military conscription. While in US detention he had run into trouble for making remarks about Islam, according to his representatives. But some Singaporeans also empathise with Amos, who has clearly struggled with the country's restrictions. "Congratulations Amos. He can now lead the free life he wants in the free world. It's just his bad luck that he was born in Singapore," said another commenter on Facebook. Mr Yee's lawyer, Sandra Grossman, said he could be released as early as Monday. In statement, Ms Grossman applauded the judge's decision and said, "The right to free speech is sacred, even when such speech is considered offensive." In September 2016, the teenager was given a six-week prison sentence in Singapore after being found guilty of "wounding religious feelings". He had posted a video critical of Christianity and Islam. He was also jailed by a Singapore court for four weeks in 2015, for criticising Christians and for posting a video about the country's former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. His video, posted on YouTube days after his death, compared the widely-respected founding father of Singapore to Jesus Christ. Later, he posted a crude cartoon depicting Lee Kuan Yew and former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who was one of his allies. The posts provoked various police complaints, and Mr Yee was reported to have received violent threats.
She also promised to boost spending on public transport and focus on health and education as part of what she called "five pacts" with the people. She later met regional mayors and governors, who agreed to her plans. But some activists promised to carry on with the largest protests Brazil has seen for at least two decades. Ms Rousseff said the reforms would be broad and focus on five areas: Mayara Longo Vivian, a leader of the Free Fare Movement, said there had been "concrete measures" among the president's proposals and that the "fight would continue". On Monday evening, there were fresh demonstrations in several cities, although they appeared to be smaller than those that led to clashes with police last week. The BBC's Julia Carneiro in Rio de Janeiro says exactly a week ago 100,000 people marched down the city's Rio Branco Avenue, but on Monday just a few dozen were chanting in front of the Candelaria church. More people joined in as they marched, and soon a few thousand demonstrators had popped up and were occupying the city centre's main avenue. Street vendors were selling Brazilian flags and Anonymous masks for those who came unprepared, she says. In other protests, hundreds of people blocked the main road to Brazil's busiest port, Santos, and hundreds more came out to protest against corruption in the capital, Brasilia. Two women were killed at a protest in the central state of Goias, not far from Brasilia. Police said they were killed by a driver who sped through a roadblock they had set up with other protesters. The deaths bring to four the total number of lives lost in the unrest. 'Signals' The president met leaders of one protest faction before meeting with state governors and mayors. "My government is listening to democratic voices," she told a televised news conference. "We must learn to hear the voices of the street. We all must, without exception, understand these signals with humility and accuracy. "Brazil is ready to move forward and has made it clear it does not want to stand where it is." She also suggested tougher penalties for corruption, and warned against any repeat of the violence that was seen last Thursday. 'No plan B' Ms Rousseff faces re-election next year, when Brazil is also due to host the football World Cup. Rio de Janeiro will also host the Olympics in 2016. Many of those demonstrating are unhappy at the cost of building stadiums in a country where many live in poverty and ticket prices for such prestigious international competitions are out of reach. Unrest has dogged many of the fixtures currently taking place in Brazil as part of Fifa's Confederations Cup, seen as a dress rehearsal for the World Cup and using many of the same facilities. Fifa's Secretary General Jerome Valcke has said the organisation has "no plan B" for next year's World Cup. The wave of rallies in more than 100 cities began in Sao Paulo, where residents were unhappy at planned rises in public-transport fares. Those increases have since been shelved, but the protests rapidly became more widespread and the protesters' demands more wide-ranging. Brazilians have been demanding better health and education, saying they are fed up with paying relatively high taxes and feel that they do not get enough back from the state. Protesters are also angry about corruption and are scornful of politicians.
Many Chinese have called for boycotts, celebrities have cut ties and e-commerce platforms have dropped H&M. Several Western countries imposed sanctions on China this week. It is accused of committing serious human rights violations against the Uighur Muslim minority in the Xinjiang autonomous region. China denies this. The sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, target senior officials in the north-west region. In December the BBC published in an investigation based on new research showing China was forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities including Uighurs into manual labour in Xinjiang's cotton fields. How did Nike and H&M find themselves here? The statements in question were made by the companies last year, but only resurfaced in recent days following the announcement of Western sanctions. Both companies had said in separate statements that they were "concerned" about reports that Uighurs were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang, and that they did not source products from the region. But the latest furore appears to have been sparked by a recent social media post by the Communist Youth League, a Chinese Communist Party group. "Spreading rumours to boycott Xinjiang cotton, while also wanting to make money in China? Wishful thinking!" it said on microblogging platform Weibo on Wednesday morning, as it shared screenshots of H&M's statement. State media outlets have since launched campaigns defending Xinjiang cotton and criticising the brands. Chinese state media CGTN shared a video on Weibo claiming to show the reality of cotton-picking in Xinjiang, which involved automation and quotes from a Uighur farmer saying that people "fought" to work there for high earnings. State broadcaster CCTV said that H&M (Hennes & Mauritz) - a multinational firm with the headquarters in Sweden - had "miscalculated" in trying to be a "righteous hero", and that it "must pay a heavy price for its wrong actions". H&M China has not yet responded to queries from the BBC, but the company posted a statement on Weibo on Wednesday saying that it "respects Chinese consumers as always" and that it "does not represent any political position". By Wednesday night, at least three major Chinese e-commerce platforms - Pinduoduo, JD.com and Tmall - had withdrawn H&M products from sale, reports said. Various celebrities such as Wang Yibo, Huang Xuan and Victoria Song released statements that they were severing ties with the brands, with one noting that "the country's interests are above all". Social media has seen a huge wave of backlash against both companies, with numerous calls for people to boycott their products. The hashtag "I support Xinjiang cotton" is now the top trending topic on Weibo with more than 1.8bn views. H&M has a long relationship with China, which is important to both sides. China is one of H&M's main sources of supply and it is a big market too. But calling out China on what it regards as a core domestic issue is something Beijing doesn't like. Just ask South Korea or the Philippines, whose shop chains and fruit exports both suffered after diplomatic spats. China likes to use its trading might and retail nationalism to pressure governments and multinationals - both at the same time preferably - to keep them quiet about its abuses. The timing of this sudden "grassroots" reaction, led by celebrities who've been happy to take H&M money in exchange for endorsement, is down to a wave of co-ordinated sanctions imposed by the UK, US and EU in the last few days - endorsed by Sweden among others.

Valeria PerassoSocial Affairs correspondent, WS Languages She's in position 51 and has an income that is $66m (£50m) lower than Cristiano Ronaldo's, the world's top earning sportsman according to Forbes. For the US women's football team, their win in the 2015 World Cup got them a $2m (£1.5m) reward. Meanwhile in the male version of the tournament, the winners were handed $35m (£26.5m) just a year earlier. These are just a few examples of a massive gender pay gap in the world of global sports that has been the standard for decades. Recent research, however, suggests that income disparity between female and male athletes has narrowed vastly over the past few years. A total of 83% of sports now reward men and women equal prize money, according to a study of 68 different disciplines published by BBC Sport, last June. Women's remunerations have been on the rise over the past three years, and 35 out of 44 sports that award prize money are paying equally. It seems like good news, especially compared to previous years - in 2014 only 70% of sports had closed the gender prize gap, and as recently as 1973 not one sport rewarded both genders equally. "Women are far more visible in sports today than at any previous point in history," says UN Women in a statement. Yet the pace of change is so slow that it will take "a long journey" to reach pay parity at the top level, experts say. "We are making progress, but it is happening at a glacial pace," says Fiona Hathorn, managing director of advocacy group Women on Boards. "The sport world is very, very male dominated still and the disparities in some sports are shocking." Cricket, golf and football are among the worst offenders, as well as darts, snooker and squash. The global sport business - worth $145.3bn (£110bn), according to a PwC estimate- is far from a level playing field for both genders. "I cannot think of any other industry that has such a wage gap, really. Depending on country context and sport, a man can be billionaire and a woman [in the same discipline] cannot even get a minimum salary," says Beatrice Frey, sport partnership manager at UN Women. Worst offenders Differences are striking at every level of the multi-billion industry of professional football. A recent study by Women on Boards highlighted that not only did the US women's team received prize money that is a fraction of the amount the men's game gets, female US footballers also received four times less than their fellow nationals in the male version of the tournament, even though the men lost in their first knockout match. The gap becomes even bigger if the total payout is considered. The prize money in both tournaments is determined by a single body, Fifa, that handed out $15m (£11m) for the women's World Cup and $576m (£437m) for the men's - an amount almost 40 times larger. And while former England captain Wayne Rooney took home a massive $400,000 a week (£300,000), the wages of his female counterpart, Steph Houghton, were meagre in comparison - around $1,600 (£1,200) a week, according to Ladbrokes Sports. Similar pay gaps can be observed across other professional sports. In golf, men in the US Open compete for a chance to take home almost $1.5m (£1.1m), twice as much the prize money for the female champion. Take the case of Lydia Ko, from New Zealand, who in 2015 became the youngest player of either gender ever to be ranked number one in professional golf. That year, she pocketed less money than the golfer in position 25th in the male ranking of the PGA Tour, estimates by Newsweek reveal. Meanwhile, in cricket a victorious male team at the World Cup can make almost seven times more than the women's side. And the pay gap is replicated also in the world's most prestigious male and female basketball leagues - the NBA and WNBA. "The highest-paid player in the WNBA (the Women's National Basketball Association) makes roughly one-fifth that of the lowest-paid player," in the super-rich NBA, calculates Newsweek. 'A boys' club' To achieve equality, experts say, it is not enough that the governing bodies of each sport establish gender-blind prizes - sponsorship and endorsements, as well as contractual conditions, have become some of the main forces perpetuating the imbalance. In tennis, for instance, the Grand Slams - the four most important events in the global calendar- have already introduced equal pay for men and women from 2007, yet the top male players consistently earn more yearly due to better sponsorship deals. That is why Serena Williams is alone in the Forbes' list of the 100 richest. "The top 100 athletes are a boys' club more than ever", wrote Forbes' sports reporter Kurt Badenhausen when the list was released, in June. "Mainstay Maria Sharapova failed to make the grade after reductions in her endorsement contracts." Those extras make up 29% of the total pie for the top 100 athletes, according to Forbes. Ronaldo earned $58m (£44m) in salary and bonuses, but topped that up with some $35m (£26.5m) from sponsors, endorsements and appearance fees. For golfer Tigers Woods and track star Usain Bolt, sponsorship account for over 90% of their earnings. "Sexism is widespread from grassroots level to elite level in the sport industry," says Frey. "At grassroots level it may mean that girls are not able to participate in a sport that is not traditionally considered to be for girls, creating bias at an early age which then follows them through youth and on to elite sport practice." Then, she says, it translates into uneven opportunities in sponsorships and personal marketing, to the extent that most female athletes around the world are "unable to secure a livelihood from their athletic practice". And the trend persists after retirement. "For retired sportswomen it is particularly problematic. Not only have they not ever earned very much money, they've probably got no pension, no house, no security," says Hathorn. "And that's an issue for girls' aspirations: why would they want to become athletes if that's what the future holds?" Understanding the gap The roots of this discrepancy could perhaps be traced back to the origins of modern sport itself. Different societies viewed physical training as an activity intrinsically linked to the "muscular male", defined against an idea of softer and more physically vulnerable femininity. The father of the modern Olympic Games, Pierre de Coubertin, described women's sport as an "unaesthetic sight" for the human eye and considered their participation would make the competition "impractical, uninteresting" and "improper" (although a few female athletes were allowed to take part after 1900). Women were only competing in races up to 1,500 metres, because they were deemed physically unprepared to cope with the demands of longer events. In terms of representation, it took until the 2012 London Games to have at least one female athlete in every country's delegation. So the sport pay gap may well be linked to a wider imbalance - that of female participation in sport, perpetually lower than that of males. "The participation is a problem that goes back to the school years: that's when it starts," says Ruth Holdaway, chief executive officer at advocacy group Women in Sport. It has to do with their awareness of the body, with how they are perceived and the gender stereotypes they encounter, says Holdaway. UN Women statistics show that a striking 49% of girls drop out of sport by the time they reach puberty, and this has ramifications in professional and elite training later in life, research shows. Turn on the TV There is a general acceptance that the breadth of the gender pay gap is also a by-product of the increasingly commercial nature of sport, where media rights play a big part. According to a study by the University of Minnesota's Tucker Centre for Research on Girls and Women in Sport in 2014, only up to 4% of sports media coverage went to female sports, despite the fact that 40% of all participants were female. And within the small amount of airtime received, the coverage of women's athletics is also more likely to be sexualised, portraying athletes off court and out of uniform, with an emphasis "on their physical attractiveness rather than their athletic competence", says Tucker Centre's director Mary Jo Kane. Hence, many would argue that women earn less because the market dictates so, as female sports are "less popular" and "not as good to watch", and as a result they generate less media revenue. What is 100 Women? BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. In 2017, we're challenging them to tackle four of the biggest problems facing women today - the glass ceiling, female illiteracy, harassment in public spaces and sexism in sport. With your help, they'll be coming up with real-life solutions and we want you to get involved with your ideas. Find us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and use #100Women It is a self-perpetuating, "chicken and egg" cycle, equity advocators argue - audiences will not get excited about women's sport as it gets minimal exposure in the media, and the media would justify the lack of coverage by saying that female athletics do not generate enough audience engagement. "That is not a fair argument, you have to invest first at many levels, including marketing and promotion, to get the general public more involved, and then the return of the investment will be better," says Frey. "Had our culture been used to seeing women rather than men playing rugby or football for generations, we would find the idea of men playing sports rather novel," adds Hathorn. Sport gaps are in fact a manifestation of wider gender inequality, says the expert, that also translates into other more subtle forms of sexism. For example, women footballers in international tournaments were required until recently to play on artificial turf, which is often regarded as of lesser quality than the natural grass on which male teams play. And then there's the language: "the World Cup is assumed to be for men, while women require the qualifying 'Women's' to describe their event", says a UN document on women in sport. Good record Despite the "glacial" pace, change is nonetheless advancing and indicates that the gap is getting narrower. Tennis is usually celebrated as a shining example of this, after all four Grand Slam tournaments established equal prize money to the men and the women in 2007. In fact, the process started in 1973 at the US Open, thanks to world champion Billie Jean King and other female players, who founded the Women's Tennis Association to fight for gender equality. Athletics have also become a case study for good practices, particularly over the past five years, with the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF) World Championships and annual Diamond series offering gender-blind rewards. Other sports that have reportedly been paying equivalent prizes include skating, shooting, volleyball, diving, sailing, windsurfing and taekwondo, as well as some cycling events. The appetite for televised female sports is also growing, evidence suggests, with social media playing a part to increase the global popularity of athletes regardless of gender. And sportswomen themselves have repeatedly stood up against sexism. Last year, for instance, five of the biggest names in the very popular US women's football league filed a complaint against their employer, the US Soccer Federation, for gender pay discrimination, while the hockey team attempted a boycott in search for fair wages. But a lot more work needs to be done, advocacy groups say. To begin with, more women are needed in decision-making positions. A Women on Boards report found a widespread problem across disciplines, with fewer than 30% of board seats held by women in many governing bodies. Women are just 18% of all board members across the 28 International Sports Federations assessed. In the 129 National Olympic Committees, the figure is even lower and has actually fallen - women are 16.6% of the board, down from 17.6% in 2014. The root of the problem lies with how women engage with sport at an early age, experts say, and any attempt to tackle gender disparity in earnings and participation should seek improvements at school level. Gender-neutral and non-segregated sport practice in school may have a positive impact on the way girls embrace physical activity in the long term and go on to consider a career as professional athletes. "I would promote that boys and girls play the same sports from primary school, because at that stage there are no major physical differences between them. If within the education system children start to play sports together, it would make a real difference in society," says Hathorn. "If we are closing the gap in the long term, we should really be working with young girls to help them change their behaviour, understand that sport is fun and it's something they are entitled to just as much as the boys," says Ruth Holdaway. A change in the model of commercial endorsements and sponsorships is also an important step in the path to pay parity. There is an untapped market for the promotion of women's events and experts believe it is actually not just fair in principle, but also a good investment. "It is not a matter of charity, it is a matter of smart business decisions," says Frey. "Corporations are now very interested in gender equality, if I were a company sponsoring for example the Premier League I would be asking myself 'is this the right image for my company?', 'is being too bloke-y dangerous for my brand?'", says Hathorn. "'We have 50% of our clients who are women but we spend 99% of our money on sponsoring men's sports, is that right?' It clearly isn't". Ultimately, experts agree, a cultural shift is needed - in which women are not seen as "second class athletes" as much as they should not be considered second class citizens in society. "Even with Billie Jean King pushing for equality more than 40 years ago, we still do not have real equality in sport," says Hathorn. "We are moving, but we are still not there."
The 1914 painting of Munich's city hall was put up for sale by two elderly sisters. Their grandfather had bought the painting in 1916. A private buyer from the Middle East, who wished to remain anonymous, bought the work, auction house Weidler said. Experts generally consider Hitler's artworks to be of poor quality. The auction was held in the central German town of Nuremberg. The auction house said bidders from four continents had expressed an interest in the work. The original bill of sale was included with the painting, which contributed to the relatively high selling price, auction house director Kathrin Weidler said. The sellers would donate 10% of the proceeds to a charity that helped disabled children, Ms Weidler added, according to Reuters news agency. Previous sales of Hitler's art have caused controversy, and been criticised by some relatives of Holocaust survivors. As a young aspiring artist, Hitler sought admission to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but was rejected. He became military and political leader of Germany from 1933 to 1945, launching World War Two and causing the deaths of millions, including six million Jewish people under Nazi rule.
The bank was responding to a report in the Guardian that Mr Gulliver has £5m in the account which he controls using a Panamanian company. The bank pointed out that Mr Gulliver lives in Hong Kong and pays taxes there and has also paid any taxes required in the UK. The statement did not mention the Panamanian company. The details about Mr Gulliver's tax arrangements have emerged on the same day that HSBC publishes its annual results. The Guardian article does not suggest any wrongdoing on Mr Gulliver's behalf, but it will add to the questions over HSBC's activities in the tax advisory business. Allegations emerged earlier this month that HSBC had helped people evade UK tax using hidden HSBC accounts in Geneva. The Financial Conduct Authority, HMRC, Swiss prosecutors and MPs on the Treasury Committee are looking into the allegations. Last weekend the bank published an apology - signed by Stuart Gulliver - to its customers and staff adding that it had completely overhauled how it conducted its business since 2008. Legal threat The former director of public prosecutions, Lord Ken Macdonald, has said HSBC has left itself open to criminal charges in the UK over the tax-dodging scandal. The QC said there were strong grounds to investigate the bank for "cheating" HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). He added that HMRC's decision not to prosecute was "seriously flawed". In a legal opinion prepared for consumer group SumOfUs, Lord Macdonald said: "It seems clear, from the evidence we have seen, that there exists credible evidence that HSBC Swiss and/or its employees have engaged over many years in systematic and profitable collusion in serious criminal activity against the exchequers of a number of countries. "The corporate and wholesale nature of HSBC Swiss's apparent involvement in what amounts to grave cross border crime makes it all the more obvious that the relevant evidence, once it came the attention of HMRC, should have been the subject of urgent and sustained criminal investigation." Despite the evidence being in the hands of HMRC for nearly five years, no action has so far been taken against the bank. Bonuses Along with its results HSBC will also be publishing the amount of bonuses to be paid to senior staff. Mr Gulliver is under pressure from some MPs and some shareholders to refuse his bonus, which could reach £1.3m.
The fear was that "several individuals with arms and explosives could launch an attack... perhaps even in several places", Mr Michel said. Some of the attackers who killed 130 people in Paris lived in Brussels. Leading suspect Salah Abdeslam is believed to have gone back to Belgium. He is now the focus of a huge manhunt. Day's developments as they unfolded Brussels terror threat: 'Everyone is on edge' The Brussels metro is closed till Sunday and people have been told to avoid crowds. These include shopping centres and concerts, and the authorities have also recommended that large events, including football matches, be cancelled, a statement said. The warning for the rest of Belgium stays at a lower level, which is still at a "serious" level. The Belgian government will review the security situation in Brussels on Sunday afternoon, Mr Michel added. At the scene: James Reynolds, BBC News, Brussels "We are closed, exceptional circumstances" says a sign posted in a shop inside Brussels' Gare du Midi train station. "Be safe." Armed police officers patrol the station's main concourse. One squad check passengers' bags. Two officers escort away a drunk man who has come in search of cigarettes. At 12:08, the Eurostar from London arrives. At the gate, a young woman is embraced by her mother who smiles and says she will take her daughter home as quickly as possible in order to stay safe. Passengers also include a group of British men on a stag weekend. They say they did not want to cancel their plans. They head boisterously out into the city. Along one of the city's main shopping streets, shops are open. Rows of security guards stand at the front doors. I write these words from a table in a half empty fast-food restaurant. Two well armed soldiers in camouflage uniform are standing a metre away from me just inside the front door. Belgian game off amid security fears Belgium's jihadist networks Interior Minister Jan Jambon earlier told reporters the country's situation was "serious", but "under control", as he arrived for a special security cabinet meeting on Saturday. A Belgian man of Moroccan descent, Ahmad Dahmani, 26, has been arrested at a luxury hotel in Antalya along with two other terror suspects, Turkish authorities have told the BBC. He is believed to have been in contact with the suspects who perpetrated the Paris attacks, an official said. He arrived from Amsterdam on 14 November; there is no record of the Belgian authorities having warned Turkey about him, which is why there was no entry ban, the official said. The Belgian authorities have so far charged three people with involvement in the attacks, claimed by Islamic State militants. In Paris, French police have freed seven people arrested during the massive raid on an apartment housing the suspected ringleader, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, prosecutors said according to AFP news agency. Abdelhamid Abaaoud was killed in the raid in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis. However, Jawad Bendaoud - who has admitted lending the apartment to two people from Belgium "as a favour", but denied knowing any more - is being held in custody. More on the Paris attacks Special report: In-depth coverage of the attacks and their aftermath Earlier, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution to "redouble" action against Islamic State following last week's deadly attacks in the French capital. The French-drafted document urges UN members to "take all necessary measures" in the fight against IS, which said it carried out the attacks. France is still hunting Salah Abdeslam, who hired one of the cars used in the attacks. French media have reported that nine militants carried out the attacks, and seven died on Friday night. So it is possible that another attacker - as well as Salah Abdeslam - is still at large. Investigators suspect the gunmen used safe houses in Saint-Denis, Bobigny and Alfortville in the Paris region. But it is not clear when the group met up to launch the attacks. Other elements of the plot also remain unclear. Investigators will be studying phone records and assessing the weapons seized for further clues. Hundreds of people were wounded in the near-simultaneous attacks on Paris bars and restaurants, a concert hall and sports stadium. The attacks were the worst in Europe since the 2004 Madrid bombings. What is Islamic State? IS is a notoriously violent Islamist group which controls large parts of Syria and Iraq. It has declared its territory a caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law - under its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. What does it want? IS demands allegiance from all Muslims, rejects national borders and seeks to expand its territory. It follows its own extreme version of Sunni Islam and regards non-believers as deserving of death. How strong is IS? IS projects a powerful image, partly through propaganda and sheer brutality, and is the world's richest insurgent group. It has about 30,000 fighters but is facing daily bombing by a US-led multi-national coalition, which has vowed to destroy it. More on Islamic State
Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs defended the closure, saying Hungary was trying to enforce EU law. Thousands of people, many fleeing war and persecution, are trying to reach northern Europe to claim asylum. EU states are engaged in a flurry of diplomatic activity to find a solution. The crisis has highlighted the limitations of the EU's system for coping with refugees, the BBC's Chris Morris says. Under an EU rule known as the Dublin Regulation, refugees should seek asylum in the first EU country they enter. But with countries such as Italy and Greece saying they cannot cope with the numbers, many have headed north. Hungary had earlier appeared to abandon efforts to register migrants, allowing huge numbers to board trains at Keleti station in east Budapest and travel to Vienna and southern Germany on Monday. Analysis by Chris Morris, BBC's Europe correspondent The European Union is supposed to have a common asylum system but at the moment it's not worth much more than the paper it's written on. Many of the migrants currently trying to reach Germany via Hungary probably arrived first in Greece. But they left the EU to travel through Macedonia and Serbia before crossing back into Hungary. Now the Hungarian government says it is trying to apply EU law, but it clearly doesn't want them to stay. In other words the system is close to breaking point and needs reform. Most of the ideas being discussed at the moment - a fairer distribution of asylum seekers around Europe, much more help for Greece and Italy to register arriving migrants, and more effective action to send failed asylum seekers home - have already been approved by EU leaders. But much of this emerging policy has yet to be put into practice, and new rules are rapidly being overtaken by events. But police evacuated the station on Tuesday, leaving about 1,000 migrants outside. The station later allowed non-migrant passengers to enter via a side entrance, but lines of police kept migrants out. An angry crowd chanted "Germany, Germany" and waved train tickets. One day across destination Europe The migrants who risk everything for a better life This West African entered the Spanish territory of Ceuta from Morocco curled up next to a car engine. Read the full story here. Many protesters in Budapest complained that they had paid hundreds of euros for tickets to Austria or Germany. One 20-year-old woman from Aleppo, Syria, named only as Marah, said her family had bought six tickets for a train to Vienna. "They should find a solution," she told Reuters news agency. "We are thousands here, where should we go?" Rights group Hungarian Helsinki Committee described the situation at Keleti station as "very tense and unpredictable". Correspondents say Hungary's action appeared prompted in part by pressure from other EU states struggling to cope with the influx of migrants. About 3,650 arrived in Vienna by train on Monday, many intending to carry on to Germany. German police said 3,500 asylum-seekers arrived in Bavaria on Tuesday while Belgium and Sweden also reported a surge in migrant numbers. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told reporters on Tuesday that Hungary would now register all migrants and send those it considered to be economic migrants back to the state from which they entered the country. Prime Minister Viktor Orban is due to meet senior EU officials on Thursday in Brussels. The number of migrants entering Europe has reached record levels, with 107,500 arriving in July alone. Germany expects to take in 800,000 migrants this year - four times last year's total. German Labour Minister Andrea Nahles said the influx meant between 240,000 and 460,000 more people could be entitled to social benefits next year, costing the state billions of euros. Papers call for EU solidarity over refugees Why is EU struggling with migrants and asylum? Full coverage of Europe migrant crisis The German government has already said it will allow Syrians arriving from other EU states to apply for asylum. But on Tuesday, a spokesman said the Dublin Regulation had not been suspended. "Dublin rules are still valid and we expect European member states to stick to them," an interior ministry spokesman said. Meanwhile, the EU's Frontex border agency said a trade in fake Syrian passports had emerged, mainly in Turkey. "They know Syrians get the right to asylum in the European Union," Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri told French radio. Risks for migrants travelling through Europe were highlighted last week by the deaths of 71 people found in a lorry that had travelled to Austria from Budapest. As a result, Austria has reintroduced border controls at main crossings from Hungary. 10 days of the migrant crisis
Helmand's governor, Mirza Khan Rahimi, insisted the authorities were still in control but his own deputy said that Sangin had been overrun. The Taliban said they controlled most of the town and the main administrative building had been abandoned. In the east, a Taliban attack near Bagram killed six US soldiers. It was one of the deadliest attacks on foreign forces in Afghanistan this year. Some 12,000 foreign soldiers are deployed as part of the Nato-led Resolute Support international coalition, which is meant to underpin Afghanistan's own security forces. The battle for Sangin comes a little over a year after the end of UK combat operations in Afghanistan, in which at least 450 soldiers were killed. During its deployment in Helmand, the British military suffered its heaviest losses in Sangin. Battle for Sangin Governor Rahimi gave a news conference in Helmand's provincial capital, Lashkar Gah, after his deputy, Mohammad Jan Rasulyar, said Sangin had been overrun by the Taliban late on Sunday. Fierce gun battles were going on between the Taliban and the Afghan security forces, Mr Rahimi was quoted as saying on Afghan TV, and the government had sent back-up forces. But Mr Rasulyar had told AFP news agency: "The Taliban have captured the police headquarters, the governor's office as well as the intelligence agency building in Sangin." Quoted separately by the Associated Press, Mr Rasulyar said casualties among Afghan security forces were high, without giving figures. Only some army facilities had not been taken, he added. Why is Sangin important? Inayatulhaq Yasini, BBC Afghan Service Sangin was once the centre of operations for international forces in Afghanistan, a key district that linked Lashkar Gah, the capital of Helmand province, to the province's northern districts. Regaining full control of Sangin would increase the Taliban's mobility in parts of northern Helmand and cut a key supply line for Afghan forces with Lashkar Gah. Sangin is also a rich opium production centre - meaning potential tax revenue for the Taliban from the drugs trade. The big question now is whether the Taliban can maintain their recent territorial gains in the district. Keeping control of the centre of Sangin will not be easy, but resentment of government troops is high in the district following military operations earlier this year which locals say wrought unwarranted destruction to property. If the government wants to wrest total control of the area from the militants, they should look to win hearts and minds - a strategy once trumpeted by the foreign forces which controlled this part of the country. Read more on why Sangin matters Police officers and soldiers inside the Sangin police headquarters had appeared to be still holding out as of Monday morning. The district police commander, Mohammad Dawood, told the BBC the Taliban had completely cut the facility off from the rest of the province, and food and weapons supplies were running low. "For the past two days we have been surrounded inside the police headquarters," he said. "No one can move out because the checkpoints along the roads are gone. The roads between the district and Lashkar Gah and other districts are closed. We also have a number of injured troops and bodies here. In the last two days the fighting has been very heavy." Mr Dawood added that, over the past month, security forces in the district had sustained 365 casualties, both dead and injured. Meanwhile, reports say the Taliban are also close to overrunning the neighbouring district of Gereshk. The head of Helmand's provincial council, Muhammad Kareem Atal, was quoted by AP as saying that "around 65%" of Helmand was now under Taliban control. In September, the Taliban briefly overran the northern city of Kunduz in one of their biggest victories in 14 years of war. Motorcycle bomber The attack at Bagram, the biggest US military facility in Afghanistan, happened at around 13:30 local time (09:00 GMT). A bomber mounted on a motorcycle reportedly attacked a patrol in a village near Bagram. US officials identified the six dead soldiers as Americans, and said another two had been wounded along with one Afghan. The Taliban said it had carried out the attack in statements to media. In the Afghan capital Kabul, a US woman was killed at a gym, with her suspected attacker, a mullah, arrested. The woman was named as Lisa Akbari.
The charity claims this amount would be enough to prevent the world from falling into poverty because of the virus, and pay for vaccines for all. The organisation is urging governments to consider taxes on the super-rich. Oxfam's report comes as global leaders gather virtually for the World Economic Forum's "Davos Dialogue" meeting. In December 2020, the total wealth of billionaires worldwide hit $11.95tn - equivalent to the recovery spending of all the G20 governments put together, according to the charity. The 10 richest people, whose fortunes rose by $540bn since March 2020, include Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Tesla founder Elon Musk and Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Oxfam claims that the billionaires' fortunes rose due to rebounding stock markets and a "rigged economy", causing rising inequality during the "worst economic downturn in a century". Many tech giants saw sales - and share prices - rise in 2020, as lockdowns led to a jump in demand for digital services. This inflated the wealth of men like Mr Bezos, whose giant fortunes are driven by the value of holdings such as property and the shares they own, rather than wages. However, "wealth" does not equal income. Wealth estimates refer to the net worth of an individual, including their money, the value of their assets and also the "notional" value of the shares they hold. A rise in share prices pertains to the perceived net worth of a company as a whole, rather than the shareholders themselves. Living in poverty The report said that Mr Bezos's worth had climbed so much between March-September 2020 that he could have given all 876,000 Amazon employees a $105,000 bonus and still have been as wealthy as he was before the pandemic. This compares with the world's poorest, for whom economic recovery could take more than a decade. Oxfam estimates that between 200 million and 500 million more people were living in poverty in 2020, reversing the decline in global poverty seen over the last two decades. "We think that this is... an opportunity to do something radical about building back fairer to think about wealth taxes, to think about corporation taxes, to think about increasing the basic social floor for every citizen," Danny Sriskandarajah, Oxfam's chief executive told the BBC. With reference to the UK, he said imposing a tax could raise millions. Aren't the world's wealthiest doing their bit? Yes - some are. There have been a relatively high number of charitable mega-donations since the pandemic began, with celebrities, sports stars and business leaders responding to the Covid-19 emergency. In an October report, UBS said 209 billionaires had committed a total equivalent to $7.2bn from March to June 2020 to fight Covid-19. "They have reacted quickly, in a way that's akin to disaster relief, providing unrestricted grants to allow grantees to decide how best to use funds," the report added. Last month, MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, revealed she had donated more than $4bn to food banks and emergency relief funds in four months. In a blog post, Ms Scott said she wanted to help Americans who were struggling because of the pandemic. As of June last year, Mr Bezos was said to have donated $125m to the coronavirus effort. Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey announced in April that he was moving $1bn of his assets into a fund to support pandemic relief efforts and other causes. This represents about a quarter of his $3.9bn net worth. Harry Potter author JK Rowling has donated £1m to help homeless people and those affected by domestic abuse during the pandemic. Meanwhile, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is chaired by Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his wife Melinda, says it has committed a total of $1.75bn to the global Covid-19 response, including for the development and delivery of vaccines and tests. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is also the third-largest donor to the World Health Organization.
By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Experts estimate the toll includes thousands of Britons each year. The British Heart Foundation, which funded The Lancet work, says the UK must clean up its air - many of its cities often exceed safe levels set by the European Union. The government has already admitted that in 15 regions, air quality will breach EU limits until 2020. But Defra says it is committed to improving air quality and that most parts of the UK meet EU air quality limits for all pollutants. Air pollution, largely from traffic fumes, has previously been linked to heart attacks but not heart failure. This happens when the heart muscle becomes weak and less good at its job of pumping blood around the body. It is often the consequence of a heart attack and affects more than 750,000 people in the UK. Deep into lungs The Lancet research looked at 35 studies with data for thousands of patients in 12 countries, including the UK, the US and China. The strongest link was found with gases such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, as well as fine particulate air pollution - fumes from buses, taxis and lorries that can get deep into the lungs and, from there, into the bloodstream. People with already weakened hearts who were exposed to high levels, by living near to or travelling along busy roads, for example, were particularly susceptible. And the increased risk seems to be strongest on the day of exposure. Dr Anoop Shah and colleagues who carried out the work say moderate reductions in air pollution could avoid 8,000 US hospital admissions for heart failure each year. "There's no reason why the impact wouldn't be similar in the UK." Alan Andrews of the lobby group Client Earth said: "The UK has a big problem with air pollution, particularly from road traffic, and the government response sadly has been worse than useless." He said people should be alerted when pollution levels are high so that they can take measures to protect themselves, by staying indoors when possible and avoiding busy roads. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution in towns and cities kills 1.3 million people globally each year. UK estimates suggest nearly 30,000 people die prematurely each year as a direct result of exposure to air pollution. Air pollution has been linked to asthma and other lung diseases, including cancer, as well as heart problems. The Chief Medical Officer recently highlighted the impact of air pollution in her first annual report on the state of the nation's health - air pollution was highlighted among the top 10 causes of mortality in the UK.
By Megha MohanBBC World Service For almost 10 years Lee So Yeon slept on the bottom bunk bed, in a room she shared with more than two dozen women. Every woman was given a small set of drawers in which to store their uniforms. On top of those drawers each kept two framed photographs. One was of North Korea's founder Kim Il-sung. The second was of his now deceased heir, Kim Jong-il. It was more than a decade ago that she left, but she retains vivid memories of the smell of the concrete barracks. "We sweat quite a bit. "The mattress we sleep on, it's made of the rice hull. So all the body odour seeps into the mattress. It's not made of cotton. Because it's rice hull, all the odour from sweat and other smells are there. It's not pleasant." One of the reasons for this was the state of the washing facilities. "As a woman, one of the toughest things is that we can't shower properly," says Lee So Yeon. "Because there is no hot water. They connect a hose to the mountain stream and have water directly from the hose. "We would get frogs and snakes through the hose." The daughter of a university professor, So Yeon, now 41, grew up in the north of the country. Many male members of her family had been soldiers, and when famine devastated the country in the 1990s she volunteered - motivated by the thought of a guaranteed meal each day. Thousands of other young women did the same. "The famine resulted in a particularly vulnerable time for women in North Korea," says Jieun Baek, author of North Korea's Hidden Revolution. "More women had to enter the labour force and more were subject to mistreatment, particularly harassment and sexual violence." Trusting defectors Juliette Morillot and Jieun Baek say Lee So Yeon's testimony accords with other accounts they have heard, but warn that defectors have to be treated with caution. "There is such a high demand for knowledge from North Korea," says Baek. "It almost incentivises people to tell exaggerated tales to the media, especially if that comes with nice pay cheque. A lot of defectors who don't want to be in the media are very critical of 'career defectors'. It's worth keeping this in mind." Information from official North Korean sources, on the other hand, is liable to be pure propaganda. Lee So Yeon was not paid for her interview with the BBC. To begin with, buoyed by a sense of patriotism and collective endeavour, the 17-year-old Lee So Yeon enjoyed her life in the army. She was impressed with her allocated hairdryer, although infrequent electricity meant she had little use for it. Daily routines for men and women were roughly the same. Women tended to have slightly shorter physical training regimes - but they were also required to perform daily chores such as cleaning, and cooking that male soldiers were exempted from. "North Korea is a traditional male-dominated society and traditional gender roles remain," says Juliette Morillot, author of North Korea in 100 questions, published in French. "Women are still seen ttukong unjeongsu, which literally translates as 'cooking pot lid drivers', and means that they should 'stay in the kitchen where they belong'." The hard training and dwindling food rations took their toll on the bodies of Lee So Yeon and her fellow recruits. "After six months to a year of service, we wouldn't menstruate any more because of malnutrition and the stressful environment," she says. "The female soldiers were saying that they are glad that they are not having periods. They were saying that they were glad because the situation is so bad if they were having periods too that would have been worse." Who defects? So Yeon says that the army failed to make provision for menstruation, during her time in the military, and that she and other female colleagues often had no choice but to reuse sanitary pads. "Women to this day still use the traditional white cotton pads," says Juliette Morillot. "They have to be washed every night when out of men's sight, so women get up early and wash them." And having just returned from a field visit where she spoke to several female soldiers, Morillot confirms that they often do miss their periods. "One of the girls I spoke with, who was 20, told me she trained so much that she had skipped her periods for two years," she says. Though Lee So Yeon joined the army voluntarily, in 2015 it was announced that all women in North Korea must do seven years' military service from the age of 18. At the same time North Korea's government took the unusual step of saying it would distribute a premium female sanitary brand called Daedong in most female units. "This may have been a way to atone for conditions of the past," says Jieun Baek. "That statement may have been to overcorrect for this well-known phenomenon that conditions for women used to be bad. It may have been a way to boost morale and get more women to think, 'Wow, we will be taken care of.'" A premium cosmetic brand Pyongyang Products was also recently distributed to several female aviation units, following a call by Kim Jong-un in 2016 for North Korean beauty products to compete with global brands like Lancome, Chanel and Christian Dior. Despite this, female soldiers stationed in the countryside don't always have access to private toilets, with some telling Morillot they often have to relieve themselves in front of men, making them feel especially vulnerable. Military service in North Korea Sexual harassment, say both Baek and Morillot, is rife. Morillot says that when she broached the subject of rape in the army with serving female soldiers, "most women said it happens to others". None said they had experienced it personally. Lee So Yeon also says that she was not raped during her time in the army between 1992 and 2001, but that many of her comrades were. "The company commander would stay in his room at the unit after hours and rape the female soldiers under his command. This would happen over and over without an end." North Korea's military says that it takes sexual abuse seriously, with a jail sentence of up to seven years for men found guilty of rape. "But most of the time nobody is willing to testify. So men often go unpunished," says Juliette Morillot. She adds that silence about sexual abuse in the army is rooted in the "patriarchal attitudes of North Korean society" - the same attitudes that ensure that women in the army do most of the chores. Women from poor backgrounds recruited into construction brigades, and housed in informal small barracks or huts, are especially insecure, she says. "Domestic violence is still widely accepted, and not reported, so it is the same in the army. But I should really stress the fact that you have the same kind of culture (of harassment) in the South Korean army." Lee So Yeon, who served as a sergeant in a signals unit close to the South Korean border, finally left the army at the age of 28. She was relieved to have the chance to spend more time with her family, but also felt she wasn't equipped for life outside the military and struggled financially. It was in 2008 that she decided to escape to South Korea. At the first attempt she was caught at the border with China and sent to a prison camp for a year. On her second attempt, shortly after leaving prison, she swam the Tumen river and crossed into China. There, at the border, she had a rendezvous with a broker, who arranged for her to move through China to South Korea. Listen to BBC Outlook A Woman Inside North Korea's Army
By Tom GreenBBC Radio 5 Live Bill Anders, lunar module pilot of Apollo 8, the first human spaceflight to leave Earth's orbit, said sending crews to Mars was "almost ridiculous". Nasa is currently planning new human missions to the Moon. It wants to learn the skills and develop the technology to enable a future human landing on Mars. Anders, 85, said he's a "big supporter" of the "remarkable" unmanned programmes, "mainly because they're much cheaper". But he says the public support simply isn't there to fund vastly more expensive human missions. "What's the imperative? What's pushing us to go to Mars?" he said, adding "I don't think the public is that interested". Meanwhile, robotic probes are still exploring Mars. Last month, the InSight lander, which will sample the planet's interior, successfully touched down at Elysium Planitia. In a statement, Nasa said it was "leading a sustainable return to the Moon, which will help prepare us to send astronauts to Mars". "That also includes commercial and international partners to expand human presence in space and bring back new knowledge and opportunities." In December 1968, Anders, along with crewmates Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida atop a Saturn V, before completing 10 orbits around the Moon. The crew of Apollo 8 spent 20 hours in orbit, before returning to Earth. They splashed down in the Pacific on 27 December, landing just 5,000 yards (4,500 metres) from their target point. They were picked up by the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown. It was the furthest humans had ever been from their home planet at that point - and a vital stepping stone on the road to Apollo 11's historic moon landing just seven months later. But the former astronaut is scathing about how Nasa has evolved since the heady days of President John F Kennedy's pledge to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s. "Nasa couldn't get to the Moon today. They're so ossified... Nasa has turned into a jobs programme... many of the centres are mainly interested in keeping busy and you don't see the public support other than they get the workers their pay and their congressmen get re-elected." Anders is also critical of the decision to focus on near-Earth orbit exploration after the completion of the Apollo programme in the 1970s. "I think the space shuttle was a serious error. It hardly did anything except have an exciting launch, but it never lived up to its promise," he said. "The space station is only there because you had a shuttle, and vice-versa. Nasa really mismanaged the manned programme since the late lunar landings." It's a view that might seem surprising from a proud patriot and servant of the US military, who still remembers his own mission to space with great fondness. It's also a view that Anders accepts doesn't sit too well with some in the space community. "I think Nasa's lucky to have what they've got - which is still hard, in my mind, to justify. I'm not a very popular guy at Nasa for saying that, but that's what I think," he explained. His former crewmate, Frank Borman, who commanded the Apollo 8 mission and also spent two weeks in Earth orbit during the Gemini programme, is slightly more enthusiastic. "I'm not as critical of Nasa as Bill is," he told 5 Live. "I firmly believe that we need robust exploration of our Solar System and I think man is part of that." But asked about the the plans of Space X founder Elon Musk and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - who have both talked of launching private missions to Mars, Borman is less complimentary. "I do think there's a lot of hype about Mars that is nonsense. Musk and Bezos, they're talking about putting colonies on Mars, that's nonsense." Apollo's legacy Reflecting on their own historic mission to the Moon, Borman described Apollo 8 as a "great endeavour" and agreed that it had won the space race. Anders said he felt that the lasting legacy of the mission would be "Earthrise" a photo taken by the crew showing humanity's home planet hanging in the blackness of space above the lunar horizon. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM, their crewmate Jim Lovell also reflected on the Earthrise moment: "When I looked at the Earth itself... I started to wonder why I was here, what's my purpose here… it sort of dawned me," he said. "And my perspective is that God has given mankind a stage on which to perform. How the play turns out, is up to us." Frank Borman and Bill Anders were speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live as part of a special documentary on the 50th anniversary of their historic lunar mission. Apollo 8: Christmas On the Far Side of the Moon will be broadcast on 5 Live on 24 December 2018 at 20:00 GMT.
The Dalai Lama, who is visiting Rome, had requested a meeting. A Vatican spokesman said that although the Pope held him "in very high regard", the request had been declined "for obvious reasons". Correspondents say the Vatican does not want to jeopardise efforts to improve relations with China. China describes the Dalai Lama as a separatist and reacts angrily when foreign dignitaries meet him. The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 after Chinese troops crushed an attempted uprising in Tibet. He now advocates a "middle way" with China, seeking autonomy but not independence for Tibet. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989. "Pope Francis obviously holds the Dalai Lama in very high regard but he will not be meeting any of the Nobel laureates," a Vatican spokesman said. He added that the Pope would send a video message to the conference. A spokesman for the Dalai Lama said he was "disappointed at not being able to call on His Holiness the Pope but he does not want to cause any inconvenience". Catholicism in China Analysts say the Vatican and China are at odds over control of the Catholic Church in China. The Chinese Communist Party oversees an official community, known as the Patriotic Association and believed to number about 12 million people, but there is also a much larger underground Church that is loyal to the Pope. A serious bone of contention between China and the Vatican is which side should have the final say in the appointment of bishops. A Vatican official said the Pope's decision was "not taken out of fear but to avoid any suffering by those who have already suffered". The last time the Dalai Lama was granted a papal audience was in 2006 when he met former Pope Benedict XVI. The Dalai Lama is in Rome for a meeting of Nobel Peace Prize winners. It was initially to be held in South Africa but was relocated to Rome after South Africa refused the Dalai Lama a visa.
The Airbus A320 - flight 4U 9525 - went down between Digne and Barcelonnette. There are no survivors, officials say. The "black box" flight recorder has been found, France's interior minister says. The cause of the crash is not known and the plane sent no distress signal during an eight-minute descent. Among the passengers were 16 German pupils returning from an exchange trip. Germanwings, a low-cost airline owned by Germany's main carrier Lufthansa, has an excellent safety record. French, Spanish and German leaders have expressed shock. A recovery team reached the site, in a remote mountain ravine, earlier on Tuesday. Their work was called off in the evening and will resume at first light on Wednesday, the French interior ministry said. Bruce Robin, a prosecutor from Marseille, told the Reuters news agency that he had seen the wreckage of the aircraft from a helicopter. "The body of the plane is in a state of destruction, there is not one intact piece of wing or fuselage," he said. Key points What we know Crash updates German school's fears mount In pictures: Germanwings crash German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier was also flown over the crash site and described it as "a picture of horror", the Associated Press news agency says. Officials believe 67 of those aboard the plane were German citizens. Forty-five of the passengers had Spanish names, Spain's deputy prime minister said. The passengers included a German school class on its way back from an exchange trip as well as two opera singers, Maria Radner and Oleg Bryjak. Ms Radner was travelling with her husband and baby. The flight was also carrying citizens of Australia, Turkey, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium. UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said it was "sadly likely" that some British nationals were on board. Sandrine Boisse, a tourism official from the ski resort of Pra Loup, told the BBC that she believed she had heard a strange noise in the mountains at around 11:00 (10:00 GMT). "At first we thought it was on the ski slopes, an avalanche, but it wasn't the same noise," she said. Analysis: Richard Westcott, BBC Transport correspondent We know the aircraft went from a normal cruising height of 38,000 feet to crashing in the mountains in just eight minutes. One pilot told me that is twice the normal descent rate, but he also said that the aircraft is capable of coming down even more quickly and still being okay. In an emergency, the pilots' first priority is to fly the plane, but as soon as they have some control they are trained to make an emergency call. That didn't appear to happen in this case, which suggests the pilots were coping with something so catastrophic they never had time to radio in a mayday, or turn to find the nearest runway. It's still too early to know anything for certain, but that might point to both engines failing, a fuel problem or something critical breaking off the aircraft. The plane began descending one minute after it reached its cruising height and continued to lose altitude for eight minutes, Germanwings managing director Thomas Winkelmann told reporters. He said the aircraft lost contact with French air traffic controllers at 10:53 (09:53 GMT) at an altitude of about 6,000 feet. The plane did not send out a distress signal, officials said. Earlier reports of a distress call, quoting the French interior ministry, referred to a message from controllers on the ground. The White House has said there is no evidence so far of a terror attack. A Lufthansa official said they were assuming for the time being that the crash had been caused by an accident. The Airbus A320 is a single-aisle passenger jet popular for short- and medium-haul flights.
That takes the total number of cars GM has recalled this year to over 13 million in the US - more than the carmaker sold in 2013. The latest move covers possible faulty seat belts, transmissions, and air bags, as well as potential fire issues. No fatalities have been associated with this recall. Most of the vehicles affected by the latest recalls were built between 2004 and 2010, although a small number of new cars and pickup trucks have also been included. Mounting pressure The company has been under intense pressure recently from regulators to improve its safety standards. Last week the company was fined $35m (£21m) for failing to address different defects which have been linked to 13 deaths. That was the maximum allowed by US law and it was the single highest civil penalty ever levied as a result of a recall investigation. The recalls have already cost the company $1.3bn in the first three months of the year and it now estimates it will cost the firm around $400m in the April to May period. It expects an internal investigation about the issue to conclude within the next two weeks. Shares were down more than 3%.
The tech giant sold 45.51 million iPhones in the three months to 24 September, beating an average estimate of 44.8 million. The company also forecast higher-than-expected holiday season revenue of between $76bn and $78bn. But revenue in the fourth quarter fell 9% to $46.85bn. That meant annual revenue fell for the first time since 2001, highlighting a slowdown in the smartphone market as well as intensifying competition, particularly from Chinese rivals. Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC Technology correspondent It was no surprise that Apple saw its first fall in annual revenues for 15 years. It became apparent earlier in the year that sales of the iPhone - surely the most profitable product in history - had plateaued and they continued to disappoint this quarter. It was hard to spot any product or market delivering outstanding results - the fact that Apple still hasn't released any figures for its Watch tells its own story - and the 30% fall in China sales looked particularly worrying. But somehow Apple's Chief Executive Tim Cook still managed to paint a rosy picture. He pointed to the 24% rise in income from services like Apple Music and Apple Pay. He told us that he was thrilled with the response of customers to the iPhone 7 - and that round the world, including in China, demand was outstripping supply. And crucially he looked forward to a return to growth in the next quarter, with Apple forecasting a record-breaking holiday season. Investors have been looking for reasons to buy back into Apple and that prediction may help continue the recent upward path of the shares. But the technology crowd is still waiting for some radical new innovation, to prove the company founded by Steve Jobs hasn't lost its creative spark. Tim Cook wouldn't be drawn when quizzed about moves into TV or building a car or a connected speaker like the Amazon Echo. He did say "we have the strongest product pipeline we've ever had". But that is a line we have been hearing for some time. Apple executives said demand for the new iPhone 7 was strong, despite fiscal fourth-quarter revenue falls in China and the Americas, its two most important markets. Revenue from Greater China, once seen as Apple's next growth hope, fell 30% in the quarter, after dropping 33% in the previous quarter. In the same period last year, revenue from Greater China doubled. Apple's shares were down 3% at about $114.80 in after-hours trading. "Apple didn't have a great [fourth quarter] as iPhones, Macs, China, the US and what appears to be Watch were down," said Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy. Net income fell to $9.01bn in the fourth quarter, down from $11bn in the same quarter last year. For the year, net income fell to $45.7bn from $53.4bn. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said it was "impossible to know" if there was any effect yet from rival Samsung halting production of Galaxy Note 7 phones earlier this month.
The statement from Republican Senator Richard Burr, Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, dismissed Donald Trump's claim his phones were tapped. Mr Trump had accused his predecessor Barack Obama of wiretapping Trump Tower during the presidential race. But White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Mr Trump maintains his claims. "He stands by it," Mr Spicer said at a daily news briefing on Thursday. The press secretary refused to accept the Senate Intelligence Committee report, saying "they're not findings". Mr Spicer quoted at length from an unproven Fox News report suggesting Mr Obama had dodged US restrictions by asking Britain's GCHQ electronic surveillance agency to monitor Mr Trump, an allegation already dismissed as "utterly ridiculous" by the Cheltenham-based complex. Mr Burr joins a cadre of Republican lawmakers who have rejected the allegation. "Based on the information available to us, we see no indications that Trump Tower was the subject of surveillance by any element of the United States government either before or after Election Day 2016" Mr Burr said in a joint statement with Senator Mark Warner, the committee's vice-chairman. Earlier on Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan also said "no such wiretap existed". Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee Devin Nunes said on Wednesday he doesn't believe "there was an actual tap of Trump Tower". But that has not deterred Mr Trump, who on Wednesday told Fox News a "wiretap covers a lot of different things". He also hinted that more details about the alleged surveillance could be revealed in the coming weeks. "Wiretap covers a lot of different things. I think you're going to find some very interesting items coming to the forefront over the next two weeks," he said in an interview broadcast on Wednesday night. No evidence of wiretapping, according to: Mr Trump echoed comments from White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who said the president used the word "wiretap" in quotes to broadly refer to "surveillance and other activities". The White House has yet to provide any evidence of the president's claims, and instead has asked Congress to examine the allegation as part of a wider investigation into alleged Russian interference in last year's election.
He was seen surrounded by cheering supporters, saying in a live TV speech that the coup attempt was an "act of treason" and the army must be cleansed. Sixty people died during overnight clashes, many of them civilians, and 754 soldiers were arrested, officials said. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said the situation was largely under control. He has ordered the military to shoot down aircraft being used by coup plotters. Earlier, one of the helicopters being flown by forces involved in the coup attempt was shot down over the capital Ankara. Read the latest live updates International reaction In pictures Meanwhile, the whereabouts of the military chief of staff, Gen Hulusi Akar, are still unknown. He is reported to have been taken hostage by rebel soldiers. Gen Umit Dundar, commander of the 1st Army, has been appointed acting chief of staff. Sporadic gunfire is still reported in major cities. Reports also say rebel soldiers in some areas have been surrendering their weapons to police loyal to Mr Erdogan. The surrender of one unit of 60 soldiers, who had taken control of one of the Bosphorus bridges in Istanbul, was shown live on TV on Saturday morning. Istanbul's main Ataturk airport is now under army control, and flights - which had been interrupted for some hours - were due to resume from 06:00 (03:00 GMT). In a statement, the Turkish foreign ministry said the coup attempt "was foiled by the Turkish people in unity and solidarity. Our president and government are in charge". "Turkish Armed Forces was not involved in the coup attempt in its entirety. It was conducted by a clique within the armed forces and received a well-deserved response from our nation." It is unclear who is leading the coup faction or how much support it enjoys. The group earlier declared that a "peace council" now ran the country and there was a curfew and martial law. Soldiers were seen at strategic points in Istanbul, with jets flying low in Ankara. Two large explosion were also heard near Istanbul's central Taksim Square. There were also reports of blasts at parliament building in Ankara. MPs were believed to be hiding in shelters. Broadcaster CNN Turk was reportedly taken over by soldiers, and its live broadcast was cut. In Washington, US President Barack Obama urged all parties in Turkey to support the "democratically elected government". Nato called for "full respect" for Turkey's democratic institutions. European Council President Donald Tusk said the country was "a key partner for the European Union". "We call for a swift return to Turkey's constitutional order," he added. 'Parallel structure' Speaking in Istanbul in the early hours on Saturday, President Erdogan promised to clean up the army. "Those who drive around in tanks will have to go back to where they came from," he said. He also dismissed the coup leaders as "terrorists". Mr Erdogan earlier told CNN Turk by mobile phone the action was by a "parallel structure" that would bring the necessary response. He has used this term in the past to refer to Fethullah Gulen, a US-based Muslim cleric he accuses of fomenting unrest. Fethullah Gulen: Powerful but reclusive Turkish cleric However, in a statement, Mr Gulen rejected any suggestion he had links to the events. "I condemn, in the strongest terms, the attempted military coup in Turkey," he said. Mr Erdogan had called on people to take to the streets to oppose the uprising. He said: "I urge the Turkish people to convene at public squares and airports. I never believed in a power higher than the power of the people." The president said he had returned to Istanbul from the holiday resort of Marmaris in the south-west of the country. He said the town was later bombed. Defying the announced curfew, a number of Erdogan supporters turned out on Taksim Square in Istanbul late on Friday. There were reports of clashes there, with some on Twitter saying that gunfire had been heard near the square. After the military takeover was announced, a statement from the group was read out on national broadcaster TRT. It said that the democratic and secular rule of law had been eroded by the current government. There would be new constitution, it said. Mr Yildirim told NTV by telephone: "There was an illegal act by a group within the military that was acting out of the chain of military command. Our people should know that we will not allow any activity that would harm democracy." Traffic was stopped from crossing both the Bosphorus and Fatih Sultan Mehmet bridges in Istanbul. Gunfire was also heard outside Istanbul police HQ and tanks were said to be stationed outside Istanbul airport. Turkey's military coups
By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter It was no ordinary crime. The hitchhiker in question was a little robot called Hitchbot. The "death" raised an interesting question about human-robot relationship - not so much whether we can trust robots but whether the robots can trust us. The answer, it seems, was no. Hitchbot has now been rebuilt, at Ryerson University, in Toronto, where it was conceived. Its story is perhaps the ultimate tale of robot destruction, made all the more poignant by the fact that it was designed to be childlike and entirely non-threatening. With pool noodles for arms and legs, a transparent cake container for a head, a white bucket as a body, and resting on a child's car seat to allow anyone picking it up to be able to transport it safely, it was cartoon-like. If a child designed a robot, it would probably look like Hitchbot. The team deliberately made it on the cheap - describing its look as "yard-sale chic". They were aware that it may come to harm. In order to qualify as a robot, it had to have some basic electronics - including a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to track its journey, movements in its arms, and software to allow it to communicate when asked questions. It could also smile and wink. And, of course, it could move its thumb into a hitch position. "It was extremely important that people would trust it and want to help it out which is why we made it the size of a child," said Dr Frauke Zeller, who led the team with her husband, Prof David Smith. The adventure started well, with Hitchbot being picked up by an elderly couple and taken on a camping trip in Halifax, Nova Scotia, followed by a sightseeing tour with a group of young men. Next, it was a guest of honour at a First Nation powwow, where it was given a name that translates to "Iron Woman", assigning it a gender. The robot picked up thousands of fans along the way, many travelling miles to be the next person to give it a lift. Sometimes, the robot's GPS location had to be disabled so that those who took it home wouldn't be mobbed outside their houses. The robot certainly appealed and the team behind it were swamped with international press enquiries from the outset. Hitchbot was given its own social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and became an instant hit, gaining thousands of followers. "People began to decorate Hitchbot with bracelets and other jewellery. This little robot with its simple design triggered so much creativity in people. And that was one of the biggest takeaways of the experiment, that we should stop telling people what to do with technology," Dr Zeller said. But Hitchbot's adventure was about to come to an abrupt end. "One day we received images of Hitchbot lying in the street with its arms and legs ripped off and its head missing," Dr Zeller said. "It affected thousands of people worldwide. Hitchbot had become an important symbol of trust. It was very sad and it hit us and the whole team more than I would have expected." Now, the team behind it - from Ryerson and McMaster Universities - and have rebuilt Hitchbot, even though its head was never found. They missed having it around and had been inundated with requests for Hitchbot 2.0, although they have no plans for another road trip. BBC News joined Prof Smith and Dr Zeller to take Hitchbot 2.0 on one of its first outings, to the safety of a cafe next to the university. The robot was instantly recognised by passers-by, many of whom stopped to chat and take a Hitchbot selfie. All of them seemed overjoyed to see the robot back in one piece. The Ryerson/McMaster team is also working with Softbank's Pepper, an archetypal big-eyed childlike robot, on another test of the trust relationship with humans. Pepper will be used to talk with patients about skin cancer prevention. The theory is that patients will communicate more openly with Pepper than they would to a human carer and the robot is part of an experiment to see if robots can be used for the promotion of healthy behaviour. Beating up bots Hitchbot is not the first robot to meet a violent end. Dr Kate Darling, of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), encouraged people to hit dinosaur robots with a mallet, in an workshop designed to test just how nasty we could be to a machine. She also conducted an experiment with small bug-like robots. Most people struggled to hurt the bots, found Dr Darling. "There was a correlation between how empathetic people were and how long it took them to hit a robot," she told BBC News, at her lab in Boston. "What does it say about you as a person if you are willing to be cruel to a robot. Is it morally disturbing to beat up something that reacts in a very lifelike way?" she asked. The reaction of most people was to protect and care for the robots. "One woman was so distressed that she removed the robot's batteries so that it couldn't feel pain," Dr Darling said. Prof Rosalind Picard, who heads up the Affective Computing Lab, also based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, thinks it comes down to human nature. "We are made for relationships, even us engineers, and that is such a powerful thing that we fit machines into that," she said. But while it is important that robots understand human emotions because it will be their job to serve us, it might not be a good idea to anthropomorphise the machines. "We are at a pivotal point where we can choose as a society that we are not going to mislead people into thinking these machines are more human than they are," Prof Picard told BBC News, at her lab. "We know that these machines are nowhere near the capabilities of humans. They can fake it for the moment of an interview and they can look lifelike and say the right thing in particular situations." "A robot can be shown a picture of a face that is smiling but it doesn't know what it feels like to be happy. "It can be given examples of situations that make people smile but it doesn't understand that it might be a smile of pain." But Prof Picard admitted it was hard not to develop feelings for the machines we surrounded ourselves with and confessed that even she had fallen into that trap, treating her first car "as if it had a personality". "I blinked back a tear when I sold it, which was ridiculous," she said. At her lab, engineers design robots that can help humans but do not necessarily look human. One project is looking at robots that could work in hospitals as a companion to children when their parents or a nurse is not available. And they are working on a robot that will be able to teach children but also show them how to cope with not knowing things. We may have to limit our emotional response to robots but it is important that the robots understand ours, according to Prof Picard. "If the robot does something that annoys you, then the machine should see that you are irritated and - like your dog - do the equivalent of putting down its tail, put its ears back and look like it made a mistake," she said. Killer robots Roboticist Prof Noel Sharkey also thinks that we need to get over our obsession with treating machines as if they were human. "People perceive robots as something between an animate and an inanimate object and it has to do with our in-built anthropomorphism," he told BBC News. "If objects move in a certain way, we think that they are thinking. "What I try and do is stop people using these dumb analogies and human words for everything. "It is about time we developed our own scientific language." To prove his point, at one conference he attended recently he picked up an extremely cute robotic seal, designed for elderly care, and started banging its head against a table. "People were calling me a monster," he said. Actually, Prof Sharkey is much more of a pacifist - and leads the campaign to ban killer robots, something he thinks is a far more pressing ethical issue in modern-day robotics. "These are not human-looking robots," he said. "I'm not talking about Terminators with a machine gun. "These weapons look like conventional weapons but are designed so that the machine selects its own target, which to me is against human dignity." Prof Sharkey listed some of the current projects he thought were crossing the line into unethical territory: And he has been working at the UN for the past five years to get a new international treaty signed that either bans the use of them or states that they can never be used without "meaningful human control" - 26 nations are currently signed up, including China.

The Egyptian-drafted resolution had been withdrawn after Israel asked Donald Trump to intervene but it was proposed again by Malaysia, New Zealand, Senegal and Venezuela. The US has traditionally sheltered Israel from condemnatory resolutions. Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not abide by the vote. Israel announced its ambassadors to New Zealand and Senegal had been ordered to return for consultations. Israel has no diplomatic ties with Malaysia and Venezuela. The Palestinian leadership welcomed the UN resolution, which was passed by 14 votes to zero, with one abstention. President-elect Trump, who will be inaugurated on 20 January, tweeted after the vote: "As to the UN, things will be different after Jan. 20th." The issue of Jewish settlements is one of the most contentious between Israel and the Palestinians, who see them as an obstacle to peace. About 500,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. Blame and bitterness keeping peace at bay US policy reverse: By Barbara Plett Usher The resolution reflects an international consensus that the growth of Israeli settlement-building has come to threaten the viability of a Palestinian state in any future peace deal. It is a view strongly shared by the Obama administration, and for that reason the US reversed its policy of vetoing any UN Security Council criticism of Israel. It is a decision that was taken after months of debate within the administration about whether and how President Obama might be able to define his position on a two-state solution before leaving office. But his successor Donald Trump has made clear he intends to strongly support Israeli government positions, even making a highly unorthodox intervention before the vote by publicly urging Mr Obama to veto the resolution. In a statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said: "Israel rejects this shameful anti-Israel resolution at the UN and will not abide by its terms. "At a time when the Security Council does nothing to stop the slaughter of half a million people in Syria, it disgracefully gangs up on the one true democracy in the Middle East, Israel, and calls the Western Wall 'occupied territory'. "The Obama administration not only failed to protect Israel against this gang-up at the UN, it colluded with it behind the scenes. Israel looks forward to working with President-elect Trump and with all our friends in Congress, Republicans and Democrats alike, to negate the harmful effects of this absurd resolution." The US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, said the resolution reflected the "facts on the ground" that settlement growth had been accelerating. "The settlement problem has gotten so much worse that it is threatening the two-state solution," she said. She criticised Mr Netanyahu's support for settlement expansion, saying: "One cannot simultaneously champion expanding settlements and champion a two-state solution that would end the conflict." However, Ms Power added that the US had not voted in favour of the resolution because it was "too narrowly focused" on settlements. She added that even if all settlements were dismantled, both sides would still have to acknowledge "uncomfortable truths" and make "difficult choices" to reach peace. A spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said: "The Security Council resolution is a big blow to Israeli policy, a unanimous international condemnation of settlements and a strong support for the two-state solution." On Thursday, Mr Trump had urged the Security Council to defeat the motion. "Peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians will only come through direct negotiations between the parties, and not through the imposition of terms by the United Nations," he said in a statement. "This puts Israel in a very poor negotiating position and is extremely unfair to all Israelis."
By Hazel ShearingBBC News Following his conviction for 159 sex offences, Home Secretary Priti Patel called for a review of controls for drugs like GHB. What is GHB? Although it is sometimes referred to as a date rape drug, GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) is actually used recreationally and consensually. It is fairly common for gay men to use it during chemsex - when drugs are used to enhance sex between two or more partners - but it is also used by heterosexuals as a party drug. But rapists use GHB as a weapon - one recent survey estimated more than a quarter of those polled were sexually assaulted whilst unconscious. GHB is a separate but almost identical drug to GBL (gamma-butyrolactone), a substance sold legally as an industrial solvent but which becomes GHB once it enters the body. Together the drugs are known as "G", and both come in the form of a clear, odourless, oily liquid that is diluted in soft drinks and swallowed. What does it do? G can give users a feeling of euphoria and can increase their sex drive. But increasing the dose by a fraction, even less than a millilitre, can be fatal. Overdosing on G - which is particularly easy when it is mixed with alcohol or other drugs, and when the strength in bottles varies - can make people incoherent, suffer convulsions, lose consciousness and stop breathing altogether. Professor Adam Winstock, consultant psychiatrist and founder of the Global Drug Survey, warns: "It's a drug that poses huge risks when people are out there trying to use it for fun." "If you take one drop extra of GHB, then 20 minutes later you're unconscious," he says. How many deaths have been linked to GHB? According to official figures from the Office for National Statistics, there were 120 deaths in England and Wales between 2014 and 2018 that involved GHB. But the total number could be much higher - GHB is not part of routine toxicology tests after sudden deaths. According to Professor Winstock, the drug can be difficult and expensive to detect. And sexual assaults? It is also difficult to know for sure how many sexual assaults are connected to GHB. Before Sinaga's conviction, perhaps the highest profile case was that of convicted serial killer Stephen Port, who was given a life sentence in 2016 for poisoning four young men with lethal doses of the drug. Of the 2,700 gay and bisexual men who have used G that responded to a survey conducted by BuzzFeed News and Channel 4 Dispatches last year, 28% said they had been assaulted. Patrick Strudwick, BuzzFeed News' LGBT editor and presenter of the Channel 4 documentary Sex, Drugs and Murder, calls G "a rapist's weapon of choice in 2020". "Because... it can be slipped into someone's drink without them knowing and because it can very easily lead to unconsciousness, it is therefore ripe for use by predators," he says. An additional obstacle to knowing the scale of the problem is that victims often don't report it to the police, says Professor Winstock. People can feel uncertain about what happened, and whether a crime occurred, he says, as well as shame, guilt and fear "of having to disclose information that they may find very embarrassing", he says. Some also fear they could be investigated for drugs offences. Is it addictive? A dependence on G can develop quickly, and Professor Winstock warns that anyone who has taken it daily should not try to stop without medical help. "People can become physically dependent, and withdrawal can be life-threatening," he says. The long term effects of taking G repeatedly are not yet known. How common is it? Like many illicit drugs, the prevalence of G is hard to track as it does not feature in national drug use surveys. But Strudwick says G is "very easy to find and to buy if you know where to look" because of the "legal loophole" that means GBL can be sold for industrial use - as a paint stripper, among other things. "Companies are shipping it to people in Britain, advertising it online... Once sold in large quantities, it can then be distributed and supplied by dealers in smaller quantities through dating apps such as Grindr," he says. Where does it come from? GHB was developed in the 1960s as an anaesthetic, but was discontinued because of its side effects. During the 1980s, it was used as a sleep aid and a supplement for body building. Is it illegal? GHB has been a Class C drug since 2003, when it was brought under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Although GBL is used legally in industry, it has also been a Class C drug since 2009, and anyone who supplies or possesses it, believing that it will be consumed, is breaking the law. Possessing either drug can warrant up to two years in prison with or without an unlimited fine, and supplying can result in up to 14 years with or without such a fine. Dr Winstock says that increasing the class would make "absolutely no difference" to its usage, and would discourage people from seeking help. Instead he says the government should focus on educating people so that drugs can be used more safely, and on promoting "honest conversations" about their use. The family of Eric Michels, who was murdered with an overdose of GHB in 2018, have been campaigning for the drug to be reclassified as Class A. His son Sam told the BBC it was "a really, really dangerous drug" which had killed multiple people, including his dad.

The campaign said that genuine files were mixed up with fake ones in order to confuse people. It said it was clear that hackers wanted to undermine Mr Macron ahead of Sunday's second round vote. The centrist will face off against far-right candidate Marine Le Pen. The documents were leaked on a file sharing website late on Friday and the Macron camp condemned the action just before the official campaigning period ended at midnight (22:00 GMT). Candidates and the media now face restrictions until the polls close on Sunday evening, meaning Mr Macron cannot issue further statements. Opinion polls had indicated the former economy minister carried a lead of 20 percentage points or more over Ms Le Pen, the National Front candidate. Separately it was reported that socialist legislator Corinne Erhel, 50, collapsed while speaking at a rally for Mr Macron in Plouisy, western France, on Friday and later died. What was released? About nine gigabytes of data were posted online by an anonymous user. Mr Macron's En Marche movement said internal campaign documents, including emails and financial data, had been taken in an "act of massive, co-ordinated hacking". "The leaked files were obtained several weeks ago by hacking personal and professional email accounts of several officials of the movement," it said in a statement. The campaign said the documents showed only legitimate campaign activities. France's election commission warned that publication or republication of the leaked information could be a criminal offence. How did the leaks spread? The hashtag #MacronLeaks appeared on Twitter on an account used by a US alt-right figure on Friday afternoon - and was reportedly retweeted 87 times in the first five minutes, suggesting the use of automated bots to spread the information faster. Within 90 minutes, the information had caught the attention of prominent supporters of Marine Le Pen and was further spread by bots. Some three-and-a-half hours after the initial tweet, #MacronLeaks had been used some 47,000 times and the prominent Wikileaks account played a key role in publicising the hashtag. Who might be responsible? That too remains unclear. The Macron camp has not blamed any specific party but said the hack clearly aimed to damage it and undermine French democracy, It compared it to the leak of Democratic Party emails in last year's US presidential election that was blamed on Russian hackers. Wikileaks, which published those emails, posted a link to the Macron documents on Twitter but implied it was not responsible. Is this unprecedented? Mr Macron's team has already been the victim of hacking attacks, for which it has blamed groups based in Russia and Ukraine. It suspects the Kremlin of wanting to help Ms Le Pen, who supports a pro-Moscow foreign policy. Russia has denied that it is behind attacks aimed at Mr Macron. On Thursday, the centrist candidate filed a lawsuit over online rumours that he had a secret bank account in the Caribbean. Mr Macron called the allegations "fake news and lies" and said some of the sites spreading them were "linked to Russian interests". What is at stake on Sunday? France's voters have rejected the two big political parties - the Socialists and the Republicans - that have governed for decades. Voters will be making a decision on France's future direction and on its place at the heart of the European Union. If they opt for liberal Emmanuel Macron, they will be backing a candidate who seeks EU reform as well as deeper European integration, in the form of a eurozone budget and eurozone finance ministers. If instead they choose far-right Marine Le Pen she promises quite the opposite. She wants a Europe of nations to replace the EU. After the Brexit vote in the UK and the election of US President Donald Trump, France is the latest country to deal a blow to politics as usual. What are the battleground issues? One of the overriding issues facing French voters is unemployment, which stands at almost 10% and is the eighth highest among the 28 EU member states. One in four under-25s is unemployed. The French economy has made a slow recovery from the 2008 financial crisis and all the leading candidates say deep changes are needed. Economic challenges facing next president Marine Le Pen wants the pension age cut to 60 and to "renationalise French debt", which she argues is largely held by foreigners. Emmanuel Macron wants to cut 120,000 public-sector jobs, reduce public spending by €60bn (£50bn; $65bn), plough billions into investment and reduce unemployment to below 7%. What the two candidates want What about security? The election is taking place amid a state of emergency, and the first round took place three days after a policeman was shot dead on the Champs Elysées in the heart of Paris. Some 50,000 police will be deployed across the country along with 7,000 troops involved in the anti-terror operation begun after the January 2015 Paris attacks, according to French media. More than 12,000 police and military will be on alert in the Paris area. The security forces will primarily guard polling stations and will be organised into "dynamic patrols" set to intervene immediately in any incident, Le Figaro newspaper reported. More than 230 people have died in terror attacks since January 2015 and officials fear more of the hundreds of young French Muslims who travelled to Syria and Iraq may return to commit new atrocities. Intelligence services believe attackers are deliberately pursuing a Le Pen victory, says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris - because that could tip the country into chaos. Ms Le Pen wants to suspend the EU's open-border agreement on France's frontiers and expel foreigners who are on the watch lists of intelligence services. What happens after Sunday? Mr Macron and Ms Le Pen came top of the 11 candidates in total who participated in the first round of voting on 23 April. While the outcome of Sunday's second round should be clear that evening, the results will be officially proclaimed by France's constitutional council on Thursday, 11 May.

By Yogita LimayeBBC News, Sri Lanka Normally the roads leading to Asian ports are bustling. Trucks loaded with cargo. Small shops where lorry drivers and workers take a tea break. Hambantota port in southern Sri Lanka is starkly different. Despite being open for seven years, the access road looks barely touched. And when we eventually found it (signage is not its strong point, and locals seemed pretty uncertain of its whereabouts too) ours was the only vehicle. Except for the few security staff accompanying us, there was no-one at the site. A car carrier eased its way out of the port, after dropping off vehicles from Asia's auto giants. But the next ship wasn't due for two days. And for a port that cost more than $1bn (£770m), that is just not enough business. 'Unaffordable' Hambantota was built by a Chinese company and funded by Chinese loans. But now Sri Lanka is struggling to repay that money, and so has signed an agreement to give a Chinese firm a stake in the port as a way of paying down some of that debt. The terms of the deal are still being debated in Sri Lanka's parliament, but the share it gives could be as high as 80%. "It is unaffordable for an activity that doesn't bring any economic returns," says Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake. "So that's compelling us to look at options." The vision for Hambantota was that it would bring more ships to Sri Lanka, and ease pressure on the Colombo port, one of Asia's most important container terminals. Sri Lanka is located on the sea route that sees oil shipments travel from the Middle East, making energy security a key reason China was keen to invest. But it also fits neatly into China's controversial One Belt, One Road initiative, building road, rail and sea links to boost trade with countries around the world. Local fury Hambantota has struggled to make money, partly because it is fairy isolated. With no industrial hub nearby, there are no natural customers on its doorstep. But now that China looks set to take control of the port, that is a problem it wants to fix and is talking to the government about plans to create a large economic zone - buying 15,000 acres of land to build factories and offices. But many who live in the area don't want to give up their homes and farms. At a small village near the harbour, locals are furious about the plan. Many of them participated in a large protest against the investment hub in January. Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse people. Some protesters were jailed for weeks, which has only deepened the anger. "We wanted to show the world that we oppose this project," says KP Indrani, who was injured during the protest. "We are not against development, but what they are doing is not going to be beneficial for us." But these deals look like Sri Lanka's best way of paying down some of the $8bn it owes China. Squandered money The island's total debt stands at $64bn. About 95% of all government revenues go towards debt repayment. And when some of that money borrowed has been seemingly squandered on infrastructure that shows no sign of turning a profit, that is even more damaging. At the international airport, barely 30km from Hambantota, just five flights take off every week serving just a few hundred passengers. Then there is a state-of-the-art conference centre that is barely used, and a cricket stadium now only occasionally rented out for weddings. Job creation But not all of China's developments in Sri Lanka have proved a flop. Roads and highways are being laid all over the country, and some have really shortened travel time between towns and cities. This has helped boost tourism, the country's biggest source of foreign income. "In the near term, there will be some local jobs for Sri Lankans," says Angela Mancini, who advises businesses and governments on investments. "But in the longer term, I think the bigger upside potentially for Sri Lanka is to really get tapped into this global trade route system that the Chinese are backing." Many of the China-funded projects were planned and constructed during the tenure of previous President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and are located in his electoral constituency. Too much to turn down A new government came to power in 2015, pledging to reduce Sri Lanka's reliance on China, but financial pressures have forced it to tow the same line. It initially suspended a major project that China had invested in - a brand new city being built off the coast of Colombo on reclaimed land. But the $1.4bn it was bringing in proved too hard to turn away, and development resumed last year. So at Colombo's historic Galle Face seaside promenade, from where once you could only see waves and the horizon, now there's a fresh piece of land jutting out into the Indian Ocean. The hope is to transform it into a modern city by 2040, with swanky corporate buildings, shiny apartment blocks, hotels, resorts, beaches, malls and even a marina. The first part of it will be available for use in two years. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), which is building the city, will get about two-thirds of the marketable land on lease for 99 years in return for its investment. "What this project will bring to Sri Lanka is foreign direct investments estimated at $15bn," says Thulci Aluwihare of CHEC Port City Colombo. "Last year foreign direct investment in the country was a mere $300m. So this would be a catalyst for Sri Lanka." 'Protect, not sell' Once again, the government has faced opposition. Groups of fishermen and locals have held protests and demonstrations. Some are worried about the environmental impact of the project. They are not convinced by the studies done by government agencies, who have given it the all clear. But many are also concerned about the growing Chinese influence in the country. "We don't like our land being given away to China," says fisherman Aruna Roshantha. "Not just China, if any country comes and takes land from Sri Lanka, we don't like it. The government should protect our land, not sell it." At the moment though, Sri Lanka's government doesn't have much room to negotiate. And Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake says they need to welcome everyone with open arms. "We love the Indians to come in, we love the Chinese to come in, we love the Japanese to come in. Koreans or European, we have no problem at all. "We need to basically sell ourselves and sell on a consistent coherent basis, and make that economic diplomacy a selling tool for Sri Lanka."
At 7.4%, this is the lowest rate since the February-to-April period in 2009, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The number of people out of work fell by 99,000 to 2.39 million in the three months to October, the ONS said. Prime Minister David Cameron told MPs the figures showed that "the plan is working". Mr Cameron said: "There should not be one ounce of complacency because we have still got work to do to get our country back to work and everyone back in work means greater stability for them, greater ability to plan for their future, greater help for their families. "But the plan is working, let's stick at it, and get unemployment down even further." But Labour leader Ed Miliband, while welcoming the news, said more people are working part-time because they could not get the hours they need. This 7.4% rate compares with a figure of 7.6% for the three months to September, and is below the rate analysts had expected. The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance in November fell by 36,700 to 1.27 million. In Northern Ireland the unemployment rate was slightly higher at 7.5%, while Scotland's figure was 7.1.%. England and Wales matched the national figure of 7.4%. The North East of England had the highest unemployment rate, at 10.1%, while the lowest rate was 5.6% in the East of England. The North East also had the highest claimant count rate at 6.1%, compared with the South East, which had the lowest, at 2.3%. Earnings pressure Average weekly earnings growth, including bonuses, picked up by 0.9% in the three months to October compared with a year earlier, the ONS said, a slight improvement on the three months to September. Excluding bonuses, pay grew by 0.8%. But this is still well below the level of inflation - currently running at 2.1% - meaning that people's earnings are still falling in real terms. The ONS data also showed that the number of people aged 16 and over who are in work was at a record high of 30.09 million, up 250,000 compared with the May-to-July period. The percentage of the workforce in the public sector - 18.8% of those in employment, or 5.7 million people - fell to its lowest rate since the current data series began in 1999. 'Spectacular strength' Economists welcomed the latest jobs figures. David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas said the UK labour market was "showing spectacular strength". David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: "These are very strong labour market figures, which back our recent forecast of increased growth in the fourth quarter of this year." And Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: "The official data are now confirming the upbeat signals from business surveys, which have shown the fastest rates of job creation since the late 1990s in recent months, as firms respond to a marked pick up in demand." The Bank of England has said it will not consider raising interest rates from their record low of 0.5% until the unemployment rate falls to 7%. But even then, governor Mark Carney has said an interest rate increase is not guaranteed. The pound jumped against both the dollar and euro after the release of the jobs figures, as expectations rose that UK rates could rise sooner than forecast The Bank's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was unanimous in voting to keep interest rates on hold, minutes from its December meeting revealed, and to leave the central bank's £375bn programme of quantitative easing unchanged. The MPC believes inflation could fall to its target level of 2% early in 2014, the minutes show, but it is concerned that sterling's recent 2% rise against other currencies could jeopardise the UK's economic recovery. The UK grew by 0.8% in the third quarter of 2013, and the Bank is forecasting growth of 2.8% next year.
"If we had, right from the beginning, shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different," Dr Anthony Fauci told CNN, but added that making that decision had been complicated. The US has recorded over 555,000 virus cases and 22,000 deaths so far. President Donald Trump later signalled his disproval with the interview by sharing a tweet about firing Dr Fauci. Dr Fauci has become the public face of the US fight against the outbreak, appearing alongside Mr Trump at the White House's daily updates. But the two have openly differed on several issues, Mr Fauci pointing out in a recent CBS interview that he takes a scientific approach while Mr Trump comes from a "hope, layperson standpoint". Mr Trump retweeted a post on Sunday from former Republican congressional hopeful Deanna Lorraine. "Fauci was telling people on February 29th that there was nothing to worry about and it posed no threat to the US public at large," it said. "Time to #FireFauci..." But the White House later denied that Mr Trump intended to fire him. "This media chatter is ridiculous," a spokesman said. "Dr Fauci has been and remains a trusted adviser." The Trump administration has issued social distancing guidance that lasts until 30 April, but there are questions over when restrictions should be lifted. What did Mr Fauci say? When asked about a New York Times report that Dr Fauci and other officials had suggested aggressive mitigation towards the end of February, Dr Fauci said health officials could only make recommendations from a "pure health standpoint". "Often, the recommendation is taken. Sometimes, it's not. But it is what it is, we are where we are right now." Dr Fauci, who is leading the US response to coronavirus, added that "no one is going to deny" that logically, earlier mitigation could have saved lives. But he said "what goes into those kinds of decisions is complicated". "There was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then." The top doctor also acknowledged that multiple factors were involved with the current situation in the US, such as the nation's size and heterogeneity, not just a later start on mitigation. But he also said parts of the nation might be able to begin a slow return to normalcy "at least in some ways, maybe next month". "You don't want to do something precipitously," Dr Fauci emphasised, noting that ending virus containment efforts too hastily could lead to a rebound. "It's going to be depending on where you are in the country, the nature of the outbreak you already experienced and the threat of an outbreak you may not have experienced." Dr Fauci was also hopeful that the US presidential election, slated for 3 November, would still take place - if the nation takes a measured approach to lessening restrictions. The president's retweet, seen as a signal of his frustration with Dr Fauci, came alongside other tweets from him criticising the media over its coverage of his administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak. In recent days the president has also been critical of the World Health Organization, as he continues to face mounting pressure over both the outbreak and the severe economic disruption it is causing. What's the situation in New York? New York has become the epicentre of the fight against coronavirus in the US. The state has almost 190,000 cases and has seen more than 10,000 deaths - among the highest rates in the world. During a briefing on Sunday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he wanted his state to open "as soon as possible". But the governor was cautious, saying there had to be a co-ordinated approach between neighbouring states, more testing availability and additional federal funding. Mr Cuomo was also sceptical of any forecasting, saying: "Every informed projection by experts, by the way, has not turned out correct." That was good news, he noted, as it meant policies and social compliance had made a difference in the last few weeks. "I've said from day one - all these predictions, we're gonna open businesses in May, do this in May, do this in June - I think that's all premature. I don't think anybody can make an informed decision right now." Mr Cuomo said the number of deaths were stabilising, albeit at a "terribly high rate" - 758 people lost their lives in the last 24 hours. The death toll has remained in the 700s for the last few days. Will US restrictions be loosened? The White House remains keen to ease social distancing guidelines, and 1 May is a target date, according to food and drug agency commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn. Dr Hahn told ABC News on Sunday, "We see light at the end of the tunnel." The decision to change restrictions would be ultimately driven by safety and welfare considerations, he added. Experts, including Dr Hahn, say increasing testing will be key to reopening the country, though Mr Trump has minimised the need for widespread testing. New York's Mr Cuomo and New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy have both called for more tests to stay ahead of the virus. On Sunday, Mr Cuomo announced an executive order calling for more antibody testing in order to determine who might have Covid-19 immunity and could return to work. The questions over when the US might relax its containment efforts come as the states continue to grapple with the spread of the virus. White House Deputy Press Secretary Judd Deere announced President Donald Trump had issued a major disaster declaration for Wyoming on Saturday, meaning all 50 states have those declarations in effect for the first time in history.

Daniel Craig will reprise his role as the British spy, with the script penned by Oscar winner, John Logan. Producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said: "We're really excited to be working once again with Daniel Craig, Sam Mendes and John Logan." Bond 24 is due for release in the UK on 23 October 2015. It will have its US release two weeks later, on 6 November. Mendes, who directed the recently-opened West End musical Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, said he was "very much looking forward to taking up the reins again, and to working with Daniel Craig, Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for a second time". He added: "I am very pleased that by giving me the time I need to honour all my theatre commitments, the producers have made it possible for me to direct Bond 24." Skyfall made $1.1bn (£700m) at the worldwide box office. It was also the highest-grossing film of all time in the UK, earning more than £94m from ticket sales in 40 days to beat the previous record holder Avatar, which made £94m in 11 months. Skyfall won two Oscars - singer Adele's theme song of the same name won best original song and there was an award for sound editing. It was also named the outstanding British film by Bafta. It was reported in May that Mendes had resumed talks with producers about directing the next Bond film, having previously ruled himself out due to other commitments. Mendes is due to follow Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by directing Shakespeare's King Lear at the National Theatre in January 2014. The last film-maker to lead consecutive Bond movies was former editor John Glen, who directed five films in a row between 1981 to 1989.
A series of tweets about fake weather conditions in Middle Eastern countries began appearing on Thursday afternoon. The accounts are the latest in a series of large corporate Twitter feeds to have been breached. The BBC said that it now has control of all three accounts and all inappropriate content has been deleted. A BBC spokeswoman said: "We apologise to our audiences that this unacceptable material appeared under the BBC's name." The attacks began in the early afternoon on Thursday. At the same time, BBC staff were alerted to a phishing email that had been sent to some BBC email accounts. It is not yet clear if the two are related. The email contained a link that if clicked on could expose password details. The BBC weather Twitter feed, which has 60,000 followers, was among those affected. Alongside the standard tweets from the weather feed such as "'last night was chilly" some more bizarre comments began emerging. They included: "Saudi weather station down due to head-on collision with camel." Another read: "Chaotic weather forecast for Lebanon as the government decides to distance itself from the Milky Way." The group claiming responsibility has previously spread messages in support of Syrian President Bashar-al-Assad. The BBC's Arabic and Radio Ulster feeds were also affected. Faris Couri, BBC Arabic's editor-in-chief said in a statement: "Today at around 11.00GMT, BBC Arabic's twitter account @BBCArabicOnline was hacked. Since then, several pro-Assad news tweets were published by the account. "We strongly condemn such action and apologise to our audiences," he said. Social engineering The attacks on the BBC are the latest in a series of hacks on high-profile Twitter accounts. Last month Burger King and Chrysler saw their Twitter feeds hijacked while a quarter of a million Twitter users had their passwords stolen. "The BBC is an obvious place to attack as it a trusted brand and so anyone who wishes to broadcast a message can reach a audience that are likely to pay attention, certainly initially," said Prof Alan Woodward from the department of computing at the University of Surrey. "The most likely source of the hack is via social engineering - someone managing to elicit the password by fooling the user who keeps the password," he added. Increasingly experts are now calling for Twitter to step up security and offer two-factor authentication, essentially a disposable, single-use password for its users. Writing about the hack on his blog, security consultant Graham Cluley said it was unclear how the password had been cracked. "The good news is that the hack doesn't appear to have been done with the intention of spreading malicious links or scams. Instead, it appears that the Syrian Electronic Army are trying to spread political messages about Syria instead," he said. "You should always use hard-to-guess, hard-to-crack, unique passwords for your online accounts that you are not using anywhere else on the web."
The Banksy mural, depicting a boy hunched over a sewing machine making Union Jack bunting, disappeared from Whymark Avenue earlier this month. It had been expected to be auctioned in Miami later but the auction house told the BBC the sale was halted. A new mural had appeared on the street wall where the image was removed. Slave Labour - the mural that was removed - appeared on the wall in Wood Green, north London, last May, shortly before the celebrations to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. It disappeared from the side of the Poundland store last weekend and had been expected to fetch up to £450,000 at auction in Miami. Fine Art Auctions Miami (FAAM) confirmed to the BBC that the Banksy mural had been withdrawn from sale. However, a spokesman gave no reason for its withdrawal. "Although there are no legal issues whatsoever regarding the sale of lots six and seven by Banksy, FAAM convinced its consignors to withdraw these lots from the auction and take back the power of authority of these works," he said. 'Affection' and 'disappointment' Earlier, Haringey Council said it had learned that the sale was stopped at the last minute. Haringey Council Leader Claire Kober said it was "a true credit to the community" that their campaigning seemed to have "helped to stop the sale of this artwork from going ahead". "We will continue to explore all options to bring back Banksy to the community where it belongs," she said. It appeared that a starting bid of $400,000 (£262,450) had been made before the auction of the artwork was halted. The new mural that appeared on the north London wall depicts a woman in a nun's habit, but it is not known if it is by Banksy. BBC Oxford producer Andy Gordon was visiting relatives on Saturday when he snapped the newest addition to Whymark Avenue in Haringey. "We thought we were just going along to see the gap in the wall and were surprised to see something else had appeared. "There was obviously a lot of affection for it in Wood Green and a lot of people were very disappointed when their Banksy disappeared." He said the new mural had appeared in exactly the same spot as the Banksy artwork. Local councillor Alan Strickland said residents had been left "really shocked and really astonished" at the disappearance of the mural of the boy. "Banksy gave that piece of art to our community, and people came from all over London to see it," he said. Banksy's work has been at the centre of a number of thefts over the years. In May 2010, two pieces were stolen from a gallery in London, after a man used a road sign to smash a glass window at the front of the building. A year later, a piece known as Sperm Alarm was ripped off the wall of a hotel in Central London, and appeared on eBay for £17,000. It was never recovered.
By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Pop star Demi Lovato is doing her best impression of Nasa's mission control as she records an insert for a forthcoming TV show. Standing in an alcove of BBC Broadcasting House, as staff mill around with laptops and coffee cups, she's really giving it some welly - which is impressive considering she has literally no idea what she is counting down from, or to. "Yeah, I don't know what that was for," laughs Lovato as she sidles into a seat to chat about her new album, Tell Me You Love Me. It's the 25-year-old's sixth record since she began her career as a child actress on the TV show Barney and Friends. Since then, she's starred in Camp Rock alongside the Jonas Brothers, appeared as a judge on The X Factor USA, and become a fierce advocate for anti-bullying and mental health campaigns. That's partly because she's had to face her own problems - including cocaine use, bulimia, self-harm, and bipolar disorder - culminating, in 2012, with a year-long stay in a sober living facility. She addresses some of those issues for the first time on her new record, in particular on You Don't Do It For Me Anymore, which describes giving up drugs in the form of a break-up ballad. The album also dwells on the end of her six-year relationship with actor Wilmer Valderrama (Lonely); and the lasting effects of her birth father's absence (Daddy Issues). But there's also space for a few of her trademark party anthems and, on the title track, the vocal performance of her career. With the countdown out of the way, Demi spills the beans on the stories behind the songs - and the time she almost killed a Beatle. I know it's a cliche, but this feels like your most personal album yet. Was that the goal? It just came out in the writing. I would go into the studio with an idea based off of a personal experience… Like one of the songs, Games, I went on a bad date and I wrote a song about it. What happened? Oh! I'd rather not say. But just being disrespected. This guy just treated me really poorly, and was playing games the whole time. Is it harder to date when you're in the public eye? It's easy and it's difficult, too. But it's kind of nice because if you find somebody attractive, you can just hit them up or, like, slide into their DMs [direct messages] and be like, "Hey, what's going on?" One of the songs on the album, Ruin The Friendship, is about making a move on a close friend. It's almost a comedy of errors... A lot of people read the title and think it's about animosity - but it's a very sexy song. Have you ever been tempted to hook up with a friend? Yes! That's what I wrote the song about! A certain friendship that I have with someone - and I want to ruin that with them. How long have you kept it secret? I think it's been a long time coming. I actually ended up sending this song to the person. And it turned out they had a song they wrote about me! So we, like, exchanged songs, which was funny. So did that lead to something romantic, or did you just laugh about it together? Ummm… Let's move on! OK... On Concentrate, you sing about listening to Coldplay while you're in bed with someone. I can't imagine a less sexy band... Oh really? I think his voice is sexy! But also - I didn't write the song. So what would be your baby-making music? Probably The Weeknd. I once asked Usher if he knew of any babies that been conceived to his music, and he said "yes, my son". Oh. Wow. That's creepy. I can't say I listen to my own music while I'm… I'm doing it! You employ a huge range of vocal colours and tones across the album. What's your favourite? My favourite is to sing very soulfully. I think Tell Me You Love Me is my ideal, because I really get to sing in it. I didn't write that one - but when I recorded it I was going through a break-up, and it said exactly what I was wanting to tell that person. I wanted to hear them tell me that they loved me. So I really related to that song when I recorded it. Does Lonely refer to the same relationship? Yeah. I didn't write on that one either, but I definitely related to it. Daddy Issues has one of the most cutting lyrics I've heard this year: "You're the man of my dreams because you know how to leave." That was a lyric that I came up with. When you grow up with an absent father, you have relationship issues - and sometimes you go for the type of person who feels familiar. So that lyric was about something that felt familiar. It's about anticipating disappointment and almost thriving off it. Yes, feeling comfortable with it. Sometimes it's more comfortable to feel pain when that's all you've known in certain situations. You've just been named a mental health ambassador by Global Citizen. What does that involve? I partnered with Save The Children and Global Citizen, for the HEART programme [Healing and Education through the Arts], which is going to help displaced children and refugees in Iraq. It started when I went over there last year, just see how I could help - and I talked to a bunch of Isis victims. I asked one girl, "What is it that you want?" and she said, "I want to be happy again." I realised there was so much PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] that they deal with - so we're starting a pilot programme to try to help, using art therapy. You've spoken quite candidly about your own mental health issues in the past. How do you keep on top of that when you're in the middle of promoting and touring a record? I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, so I eat very clean, I get a lot of sleep and I set aside some time to myself every day. What do you do in that time? Meditation? I make sure that I work out. And that's like an hour-and-a-half of me devoting to myself. An hour-and-a-half a day? That's tough. I manage to run about half an hour a week. Oh I don't like to run. What do you do? Mixed Martial Arts. [She has a blue belt in Jiu-Jitsu] So don't get on the wrong side of Demi Lovato. Yes - don't mess with me! Speaking of which, is it true you once nearly ran over Paul McCartney? Yes, but it's not as dramatic as I made it sound! He was standing in a parking space I was trying to get into and I honked the horn because someone was in my way. Then he turned around and it was Paul McCartney! Did he give you the thumbs-up? He turned around and said, "Oh, I'm so sorry" and I was like, "Don't worry about it! You're a Beatle!" You realise no-one's honked their horn at Paul McCartney in years… You know, I don't remember if I honked the horn, or if I just kept inching up so he would move… Oh God, you could have crushed a Beatle! Yes, it would have been a very bad headline! And the headline's bad enough already. Demi Lovato's album, Tell Me You Love Me, is out now on Polydor records.

He is the highest-ranking US official to publicly implicate Beijing since news of the data breach emerged. China always dismissed suggestions that it was behind the hacking. The statement comes after three days of high-level talks in which China and the US agreed to a "code of conduct". "China remains the leading suspects," said Mr Clapper at a conference in Washington DC, but "the US government continues to investigate" he added, according to his office. Background to a "massive" hack in five points US hit by 'massive data breach' China military unit 'behind prolific hacking' At the Washington talks where cyber security was a top priority, US Secretary of State John Kerry said there was a need to work with China to develop a "code of conduct" on state behaviour in cyberspace - Chinese representatives had agreed with these conclusions. "It's something that we agreed needs to be addressed and hopefully it can be addressed soon," State Department spokesman John Kirby said on Thursday. China has said any suggestion that it was behind the hacking is "irresponsible and unscientific".
By Ritu PrasadBBC News, Washington What did Pence say? "Faith in America is rising again because President Trump and our entire administration have been advancing the very principles that you learned here in the halls of Hillsdale College," he told a crowd at a Christian conservative campus in Michigan on Saturday. "In fact, the percentage of Americans who live out their religion on a weekly basis - praying, going to church, reading and believing in the Bible - has remained remarkably consistent over the decades, even as the population of the United States has grown by leaps and bounds." The vice-president also claimed that "relative to the population, four times as many Americans go to church on a regular basis than at the time of our nation's founding". What do the numbers say? According to Greg Smith, associate director for religion research at the Pew Research Center, Mr Pence's claims do not appear follow the numbers. "The data we do have do not suggest a recent increase in the share of Americans who are highly religious," Mr Smith told the BBC. "The vast majority of Americans do say they believe in God, but those numbers are ticking downward," he added. As for Mr Pence's suggestion that more Americans are going to church in modern times? Aside from sheer population differences from 1776 to now, the figures do not support that claim either, according to Mr Smith. "We've begun to see in recent years smaller but noticeable declines in the share of Americans who say they believe in God, who say religion is important to them in their personal lives, who say they pray every day and we've seen declines in the share of Americans who say they attend religious services regularly," he said. A 2017 study published in Sociological Science showed that those who are intensely religious are still going to church consistently and frequently, but once-a-week attendance is dropping. Mr Smith also noted the data shows the number of Americans identifying as atheist, agnostic or nothing in particular is "growing very, very rapidly". "The share of Americans who identify with Christianity is declining because the share of Americans who identify with no religion is growing," Mr Smith said. A 2017 study by the Public Religion Research Institute also tracked a diminishing white Christian presence across the US. In 1996, 65% of Americans identified as white Christians. Over the last decade, that number has dropped to 43%. What has the Trump administration done for Christian conservatives? Mr Trump has been popular among Christian conservatives, particularly after choosing Mr Pence, an evangelical Christian, as his vice-president. He has held to some of his campaign promises, such as appointing a high number of conservative judges - most notably, Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. In January last year, Mr Trump reinstated a 1984 policy banning international groups which perform or provide information on abortions from receiving federal money. On Monday, the Trump administration delivered on another promise made to evangelical Christians during the campaign: recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital. For some evangelical Christians, the support for Israel comes from passages in the Bible they believe show that God intended Israel for the Jewish people. How much impact has Trump had on religious communities? Despite some wins for Christian conservatives, the Trump administration has not fulfilled promises to ban late-term abortions, defund Planned Parenthood or repeal the Johnson Amendment - a provision prohibiting non-profit charities like churches from endorsing political candidates. For Casper ter Kuile, Ministry Innovation Fellow at the Harvard Divinity School, the impact of this administration on religion in America depends on how we define faith. "Vice-President Pence is correct in asserting a widespread belief in God or a higher power - nine out of ten Americans agree with that," Mr ter Kuile told the BBC. "But Pence is one of only 56% of Americans who believe in a traditional conservative God of the Bible. "The number of Americans with that kind of faith is plummeting. "More than one in three millennials are now religiously unaffiliated. On average 3,500 churches close every year in America."
By Jonathan MarcusDefence and diplomatic correspondent How come Saudi Arabia and Iran don't get along? Saudi Arabia and Iran - two powerful neighbours - are locked in a fierce struggle for regional dominance. The decades-old feud between them is exacerbated by religious differences. They each follow one of the two main branches of Islam - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power. This religious schism is reflected in the wider map of the Middle East, where other countries have Shia or Sunni majorities, some of whom look towards Iran or Saudi Arabia for support or guidance. Historically Saudi Arabia, a monarchy and home to the birthplace of Islam, saw itself as the leader of the Muslim world. However this was challenged in 1979 by the Islamic revolution in Iran which created a new type of state in the region - a kind of revolutionary theocracy - that had an explicit goal of exporting this model beyond its own borders. In the past 15 years in particular, the differences between Saudi Arabia and Iran have been sharpened by a series of events. The 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq overthrew Saddam Hussein, a Sunni Arab who had been a major Iranian adversary. This removed a crucial military counter-weight to Iran. It opened the way for a Shia-dominated government in Baghdad and Iranian influence in the country has been rising ever since. Fast-forward to 2011 and uprisings across the Arab world caused political instability throughout the region. Iran and Saudi Arabia exploited these upheavals to expand their influence, notably in Syria, Bahrain and Yemen, further heightening mutual suspicions. Iran's critics say it is intent on establishing itself or its proxies across the region, and achieving control of a land corridor stretching from Iran to the Mediterranean. How have things got worse? The strategic rivalry is heating up because Iran is in many ways winning the regional struggle. In Syria, Iranian (and Russian) support for President Bashar al-Assad has enabled his forces to largely rout rebel group groups backed by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is trying desperately to contain rising Iranian influence while the militaristic adventurism of the kingdom's young and impulsive Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman - the country's de facto ruler - is exacerbating regional tensions. He is waging a war against the rebel Houthi movement in neighbouring Yemen, in part to stem perceived Iranian influence there, but after four years this is proving a costly gamble. Iran has denied accusations that it is smuggling weaponry to the Houthis, though successive reports from a panel of UN experts have demonstrated significant assistance for the Houthis from Tehran in terms of both technology and weaponry. Meanwhile in Lebanon, Iran's ally, Shia militia group Hezbollah, leads a politically powerful bloc and controls a huge, heavily armed fighting force. Many observers believe the Saudis forced Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri, whom it backs, to resign in 2017 over Hezbollah's involvement in regional conflicts. He later returned to Lebanon and put the resignation on hold. There are also external forces at play. Saudi Arabia has been emboldened by support from the Trump administration while Israel, which sees Iran as a mortal threat, is in a sense "backing" the Saudi effort to contain Iran. The Jewish state is fearful of the encroachment of pro-Iranian fighters in Syria ever closer to its border. Israel and Saudi Arabia were the two countries most resolutely opposed to the 2015 international agreement limiting Iran's nuclear programme, insisting that it did not go far enough to roll back any chance of Iran obtaining the bomb. Who are their regional allies? Broadly speaking the strategic map of the Middle East reflects the Shia-Sunni divide. In the pro-Saudi camp are the other major Sunni actors in the Gulf - the UAE and Bahrain - as well as Egypt and Jordan. In the Iranian camp is Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, a member of a heterodox Shia sect, who has relied on pro-Iranian Shia militia groups, including the Lebanon-based Hezbollah, to fight predominantly Sunni rebel groups. Iraq's Shia-dominated government is also a close ally of Iran, though paradoxically it also retains a close relationship with Washington on whom it has depended for help in the struggle against so-called Islamic State. How is the Saudi-Iranian rivalry being played out? This is in many ways a regional equivalent of the Cold War, which pitted the US against the Soviet Union in a tense military standoff for many years. Iran and Saudi Arabia are not directly fighting but they are engaged in a variety of proxy wars (conflicts where they support rival sides and militias) around the region. Syria is an obvious example, while in Yemen Saudi Arabia has accused Iran of supplying ballistic missiles fired at Saudi territory by the rebel Houthi movement. Iran is also accused of flexing its muscle in the strategic waterways of the Gulf, through which oil is shipped from Saudi Arabia. The US says Iran was behind recent attacks on foreign tankers there - something it denies. Are we heading towards a direct war between Saudi Arabia and Iran? So far Tehran and Riyadh have fought via proxies. Neither is really geared up for a direct war with the other but a major Houthi attack against the Saudi capital or, as in the most recent case, against a key economic target could upset the apple cart. Houthi attacks against Saudi Arabia's infrastructure have inevitably added a new front to the confrontation between Tehran and Riyadh. As in the Gulf, where Iran and Saudi face each other across a maritime border, rising tensions could risk a much broader conflict. For the US and other Western powers, freedom of navigation in the Gulf is essential and any conflict that sought to block the waterway - vital for international shipping and oil transportation - could easily draw in US naval and air forces. For a long time the US and its allies have seen Iran as a destabilising force in the Middle East. The Saudi leadership increasingly sees Iran as an existential threat and the crown prince seems willing to take whatever action he sees necessary, wherever he deems it necessary, to confront Tehran's rising influence. Saudi Arabia's vulnerability has been demonstrated by these latest attacks on its oil installations. If a war breaks out, it will be more perhaps by accident rather than design. But the Saudis' own activism, encouraged in part by a lingering uncertainty as to the Trump administration's own goals in the region, inevitably adds another element of tension.
S&P said Twitter's $1.8bn (£1.1bn) September debt issue - IOUs sold to investors in return for interest - were worthy of a "speculative" rating of BB-, three notches below investment grade. News of the rating sent New York listed Twitter shares tumbling nearly 6%. The social network's push for acquisitions despite slow earnings growth was behind the low rating. "The company is investing very aggressively in growth. Depending on the level of business reinvestment, Twitter may not generate positive discretionary cash flow until 2016," S&P said in a note. Just last week, Twitter announced that it was opening an office in Hong Kong despite being banned from operating in mainland China to grow its advertising and sales reach. Twitter troubles In October, Twitter reported a disappointing 7% fall in timeline views per user - a closely watched measure of engagement - despite a 23% growth in its user base in the third quarter. The company also said its fourth-quarter revenue might fall short of market expectations of $448.8m (£283m). S&P said it could raise the rating if Twitter broadened its revenue sources, launched new products and maintained its market share, along with improving its profitability, and cash flows. But, it also added that the rating could be downgraded still lower. Twitter shares gave up most of the 7% gain made on Wednesday after the company announced it was considering creating additional mobile applications beyond its core messaging service and video app. Its shares have lost 37% so far this year.
A wider range of birth defects has been linked to the virus, said Dr Anne Schuchat of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And the mosquitoes that carry the virus could travel to more US states than previously thought, she said. The current Zika outbreak began almost a year ago in Brazil. It has been linked to thousands of birth defects there and has spread widely through the Americas. "Most of what we've learned is not reassuring," said Dr Schuchat at a White House briefing on Monday. "Everything we know about this virus seems to be scarier than we initially thought." There have been 346 confirmed cases of Zika in the continental United States, according to the CDC, all associated with travel. Earlier this year, US President Barack Obama asked the US Congress for $1.9bn (£1.25bn) in emergency funding to combat the virus. In the meantime it has been using money totalling $589m left over from the Ebola virus fund.

The US now needs more money to fight the mosquitoes and to fund better research into vaccines and treatments, he said. "When the president asked for $1.9 billion, we needed $1.9 billion." Dr Fauci said initial trials of a Zika vaccine would likely start in September this year. Depending on the results, larger trials could begin at the start of 2017. "The very, very best scenario" would be a vaccine ready for the general public by the beginning of 2018, he told the BBC World Service. He said there had been recent discoveries about how destructive Zika appeared to be to foetal brains. There were also reports of rare neurologic problems in adults, he said. The CDC announced that Puerto Rico is to receive $3.9m in emergency Zika funding as the number of cases there doubles every week. In February, the first US case of locally transmitted Zika was reported in Dallas, Texas - spread through sexual contact, not a mosquito bite.
By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online A team at King's College London looked at responses from more than 400,000 people reporting suspected Covid-19 symptoms to an app. But loss of smell and taste are also signs of other respiratory infections, such as the common cold. And experts say fever and cough remain the most important symptoms of the virus to look out for and act upon. If you or someone you live with has a new continuous cough or high temperature, the advice is stay at home to stop the risk of spreading coronavirus to others. Coronavirus: What should I do? What did the study find? The King's College researchers wanted to gather information on possible coronavirus symptoms to help experts better understand and fight the disease. Of those reporting one or more symptoms of coronavirus to the Covid Symptom Tracker app: Of these 400,000 people, 1,702 said they had been tested for Covid-19, with 579 receiving a positive result and 1,123 a negative one. Among the ones who had coronavirus infection confirmed by a positive test, three-fifths (59%) reported loss of smell or taste. Should loss of smell and taste be added to the key symptoms to watch out for? Experts say there's not enough evidence yet. Public Health England and the World Health Organization have not added them to the list. ENT UK, the body that represents Ear, Nose and Throat doctors, says it is not surprising that some patients with coronavirus might report these as symptoms, but they are not specific to Covid-19. They advocate including them as possible coronavirus symptoms. The King's researchers say loss of smell and taste might be useful extra symptoms to watch for, perhaps not on their own but alongside other important ones like cough and fever. Lead researcher Prof Tim Spector said: "When combined with other symptoms, people with loss of smell and taste appear to be three times more likely to have contracted Covid-19 according to our data, and should therefore self-isolate for seven days to reduce the spread of the disease."
The country is often depicted as isolated and thoroughly out of step with the 21st century. Statistics are hard to get and often based on estimates, but what can they tell us about life in the North? Kim Il-sung effectively founded North Korea in 1948 and his family dynasty has ruled the country ever since, with control passing from father to son. In the same period South Korea has managed six republics, a revolution, a couple of coups and the transition to free and fair elections. In total 12 presidents have led the country, covering 19 terms of office. Three million mobile phones might seem like a lot - but in a country of 25 million it amounts to just over one out of every ten people. Most mobile users are likely to be concentrated in the capital Pyongyang. By contrast, with a population of some 51 million there are more mobile phone subscriptions than people in South Korea. With effectively a single network, Koryolink, North Korea's mobile market is limited but growing. Originally established as a partnership with Egyptian telecom firm Orascom, it was for many years the only option. However, in 2015 Orascom discovered that North Korea was setting up a rival network, Byol, and was forced to disclose to investors that it had effectively lost control over the service's three million plus subscribers. There's reason to be sceptical about those subscriber numbers though. Research by the US-Korea Institute at SAIS suggests that some growth might be down to North Koreans calculating that it's cheaper to buy an additional subscription than additional air time. As well as a scarcity of mobiles, the vast majority of North Koreans are only permitted access to the country's 'private internet' - effectively a closed intranet operating on a national scale. Reports in 2016 suggested that North Korea has just 28 registered domains. It may sound like an urban myth, but there is some research to suggest that North Korean men are on average shorter than their South Korean counterparts. Professor Daniel Schwekendiek from Sungkyunkwan University in Seoul studied the heights of North Korean refugees measured when they crossed the border into South Korea and found an average 3-8cm (1.2 -3.1 inch) difference. Schwekendiek points out that the height difference cannot be attributed to genetics, because the two populations are the same. He also rejects criticism that suggests that refugees are more likely to be impoverished, and therefore of smaller stature. Food shortages are thought to be the main factor in why North Koreans are generally shorter. Read more: Are North Koreans really shorter than South Koreans? Images from North Korea's capital Pyongyang often show stretches of wide, pristine motorway unoccupied by traffic, but outside the city it's another story. North Korea has some 25,554 km of roads, according to 2006 figures, but just 3% are actually paved, amounting to a meagre 724km (449 miles). It's also estimated that only about 11 out of every 1,000 North Koreans owns a car, which means a long queue at the bus stop for most people who need to travel. North Korea relies on coal exports to keep its economy above water - but it's hard to measure their true value as the data comes from countries receiving the coal. Much of North Korea's coal is exported to China, which banned imports in February 2017. However some analysts question the nature of the sanction. "There are folks who track ships and have seen North Korean ships docking at coal terminals at Chinese ports even after the ban. I do believe that China has disrupted coal imports, but not completely," says Kent Boydston, research analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Until 1973 North and South Korea were pretty evenly matched in terms of wealth. Since then, South Korea has rocketed ahead to become one of the world's leading industrial producers, with companies like Samsung and Hyundai becoming global household names. North Korea stagnated in the 1980s as the country stuck rigidly to its state-run system. While North Korea is the 52nd largest country by population, it is considered to have the world's fourth largest army. Military spending is estimated to account for as much as 25% of GDP, and almost every North Korean man undergoes some form of military training. Read more about North Korea's military strength A series of famines in the late 1990s caused a sharp drop in life expectancy in North Korea, but even without that factor, the North lags nearly 12 years behind. Food shortages persist and are one of many reasons why South Koreans generally live longer. In 2017 South Korea's birth rate hit a record low as the country continued a decade-long struggle to boost the country's birth rate. It has spent about $70bn (£53bn) handing out baby bonuses, improving paternity leave and paying for infertility treatment. Produced by Alex Murray and Tom Housden.

Linda YuehChief business correspondent Yet stocks across Asia fell and analysts are gloomy, estimating that this coming year will see the slowest growth since 1990 of 7.4%. Growth is already much slower than the prior decade, since 7.7% growth, the same as in 2012, is the weakest since 1999 - that's the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. If the forecasts are right, then 7.4% growth would be the slowest since 1990, which is before China significantly opened its economy to the world. But the Chinese government is attempting to persuade markets and others that it is slowing the economy down to a more sustainable pace and trying to be less reliant on investment-led, credit-fuelled growth. Notably, fixed asset investment expanded 19.6% last year, which is about the slowest pace in a decade. Industrial production growth has also slowed to less than 10% year-on-year, less than half the 22% annual average expansion during the 2000s. Rebalancing This is the core of the concern. China is aiming to restructure its growth drivers away from investment and production towards consumption and services. Such economies grow more slowly than those in the process of industrialisation. With industry having accounted for half of GDP, China is past the rapid, catch-up phase. In this next era it is tougher to sustain a healthy growth rate. Many countries, as they de-industrialise and move more into services, see a deceleration in growth. The premier Li Keqiang views 7% as the lowest acceptable growth rate. But there are numerous challenges achieving it, which I have written about before. There's one that looms large. China's working-age population fell by 2.44 million last year, which is the second straight year of decline. It is reminiscent of the problems of ageing faced by rather more developed countries like Japan. A shrinking workforce usually means less investment and productivity; China's problem is self-inflicted through its one-child policy. The government has decided to relax the policy and allow parents who are single children themselves to have more than one child. It will take a generation before the change bears fruit, however. Shrinking For now, China has the challenge of trying to raise the productivity of a shrinking labour force who are working more in service sector jobs. Whether it can hit a plausible growth rate to support a still poor country is perhaps why markets have reacted negatively, despite the GDP growth target being hit. China is almost in a "no win" situation. If it grew more rapidly through debt and investment, then its growth would be judged to be unsustainable and unbalanced. If it grew more slowly, there'd be concern over how slow the "new normal" growth rate would be and whether it would be enough to lift the incomes of a country whose per capita GDP is only around $7,000. China's unenviable task is to emphasise how the growth slowdown is what they had planned all along. After all, the government would point to GDP growth exceeding target. For the sceptics, the underlying micro data and an ageing demography are trends that require more than government assurances to persuade them that the economy is on the right track.
From Wednesday, sun cream that includes common ingredients, including oxybenzone, is not allowed to be worn or sold in the country. Palau's President Tommy Remengesau said: "We have to live and respect the environment because the environment is the nest of life." The island nation markets itself as a "pristine paradise" for divers. A lagoon in Palau's Rock Islands is a Unesco World Heritage site. The country has a population of around 20,000 dotted across hundreds of islands. The ban - which was announced in 2018 - prohibits sun cream containing any of 10 ingredients. The list includes oxybenzone and octinoxate, which absorb ultraviolet light. The International Coral Reef Foundation said the banned chemicals were "known environmental pollutants - most of them are... incredibly toxic to juvenile stages of many wildlife species". Mr Remengesau told the AFP news agency: "When science tells us that a practice is damaging to coral reefs, to fish populations, or to the ocean itself, our people take note and our visitors do too. "Toxic sunscreen chemicals have been found throughout Palau's critical habitats, and in the tissues of our most famous creatures. "We don't mind being the first nation to ban these chemicals, and we will do our part to spread the word." The number of sun creams containing the harmful chemicals is declining. In 2018, experts said it was found in about half of creams and lotions. When the US state of Hawaii announced a similar ban - which comes into effect in 2021 - major brands were quick to say their products were "reef bill compliant". Other places to announce bans include the US Virgin Islands - where the law takes effect in March - and the Dutch Caribbean island of Bonaire.
Mr Hollande, whose party was beaten by the far right in last week's European Parliament election, said the EU had become too complex and remote. In response, he will tell EU leaders at a meeting in Brussels later that they must focus on boosting the economy. The three big pro-EU centrist blocs are still on course for a majority. But they have lost seats in the European Parliament to parties seeking to curb EU powers or abolish the union, among them the UK Independence Party which came first in the domestic vote with 27% according to provisional results. In France, the far-right National Front stormed to victory with a preliminary 25% of the vote, pushing Mr Hollande's Socialists into third place. National Front President Marine Le Pen said on Tuesday that her party would use its electoral mandate to "defend France" and fight "crazy measures like votes for immigrants". The BBC's Matthew Price in Brussels says she made a direct challenge, not just to French politicians, but to Brussels too - saying it must listen to the people, and that the French had to protect their nation. This agenda will affect policy-making in the EU in the coming years, our correspondent says. Vote 2014 Full coverage of results Speaking on French TV, Mr Hollande - a leading champion of the EU - said the project had become "remote and incomprehensible", and that that had to change. "Europe has to be simple, clear, to be effective where it is needed and to withdraw from where it is not necessary," he said. He said the union had overcome the crisis in the eurozone "but at what price? An austerity that has ended up disheartening the people". When European Union leaders meet on Tuesday he would "reaffirm that the priority is growth, jobs and investment", he said. Matthew Price, BBC News, Brussels Europe has not "voted against the EU". The vast majority of those who bothered to cast a ballot did so for parties that are pro-EU, and they will make up the majority in the new parliament. Yes, the focus is understandably on France and the UK, with Denmark, Greece, and others also giving Euro-enthusiasts cause for concern. However in many countries mainstream parties dominated - in Germany, Italy, Poland where it was felt a growing Eurosceptic movement could break through, in the Netherlands and elsewhere. So the results do not constitute a "problem" as such for the leaders of the EU. Many leaders will point this out around the dinner table tonight. Others, however, will stress that a sizeable chunk of voters chose parties that want "Brussels" to change, and that the EU needs to address this issue if it is to maintain popular support and legitimacy in the longer term. Ahead of this election most leaders were not planning to come to Brussels to discuss how to reset their country's relationship with the EU. David Cameron was of course - but others were not. Will others - under domestic pressure - now join him? Anti-EU forces overshadow Brussels talks Mrs Merkel - whose conservative Christian Democratic Union won a comfortable 35% of the vote in Germany - said it was now up to the established parties of Europe to win voters back by focusing on "improving competitiveness, on growth and creating jobs". "This is the best answer to the disappointed people who voted in a way we didn't wish for," she said. Elsewhere in Europe, the anti-EU UKIP was celebrating winning 27% of the vote, marking the first time in a century that a party other than the Conservatives or Labour has won any UK election. Prime Minister David Cameron, whose Conservative party lost seven seats, said it was clear voters were "deeply disillusioned" with Europe and that the message was "received and understood". But he insisted he would neither bring forward the date of an in/out referendum on UK withdrawal from the EU - scheduled for 2017 - nor seek a pact with UKIP. 'Truly democratic debate' Despite the unprecedented Eurosceptic gains across the Union, Jose Manuel Barroso, outgoing president of the European Commission, insisted that the pro-EU blocs still had "a very solid and workable majority". The centre-right European People's Party appears set to win 213 out of the 751 seats, with 28.36% across the bloc, according to estimated results issued by the European Parliament. That would mean it remains the biggest group - but with more than 60 seats fewer than before. The Socialist alliance has a projected 190 seats, with 25.3% of the vote, the Liberals 9% and the Greens 7%. The Eurosceptic Europe of Freedom and Democracy group appeared to have around 38 seats - including the 24 for UKIP. But the number of non-attached right-wing MEPs is set to rise, boosting the Eurosceptic camp. Mr Barroso said a "truly democratic debate" was needed to address the concerns of those who did not vote, or "voted in protest". Turnout across Europe is estimated at 43.1%, the first time it has not fallen since the previous election - but it has only increased by 0.1%. Result highlights (from European Parliament website): The election is the biggest exercise in multi-national democracy in the world, affecting the lives of the EU's 500 million citizens. The parliament's powers have expanded since the last election in 2009, and it is hoping to have a decisive say in who gets the EU's top job, president of the European Commission.

In Vancouver, Toronto and London, demonstrators were confronted by pro-Beijing rallies. Hundreds also protested in Sydney's Belmore Park on Sunday. Some wore facemasks due to fears of alleged Chinese state surveillance of citizens who support Hong Kong from abroad. On Sunday hundreds of thousands of people took part in pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong despite increasingly severe warnings from the Chinese central government. All photos subject to copyright.
Study for a Portrait 1953 exceeded expectation as Christie's had valued the masterpiece at £11m. The oil canvas, which has not been up for auction before, was described as "an arresting and dark study in the degradation of power". It was previously owned by two of Bacon's contemporaries - Rodrigo Moynihan and Louis Le Brocquy. The work was the second most valuable piece to be sold at one of Christie's post-war and contemporary art sales, a spokesperson said. The highest selling work in this category was Bacon's Triptych, which went for £26.3m in February 2008. Other items sold at Tuesday's auction included Lucian Freud's Woman Smiling, 1958-59, which went for £4.7m. Seven works from the collection of Kay Saatchi went for a total of £3.9m.
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the decision after a court annulled the site's museum status. Built 1,500 years ago as an Orthodox Christian cathedral, Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque after the Ottoman conquest in 1453. In 1934 it became a museum and is now a Unesco World Heritage site. Islamists in Turkey long called for it to be converted to a mosque but secular opposition members opposed the move. The proposal prompted criticism from religious and political leaders worldwide. Defending the decision, President Erdogan stressed that the country had exercised its sovereign right in converting it back to a mosque. He told a press conference the first Muslim prayers would be held inside the building on 24 July. "Like all our mosques, the doors of Hagia Sophia will be wide open to locals and foreigners, Muslims and non-Muslims," he added. A change is coming to Hagia Sophia, which has endured since the 6th century, outlasting the Byzantine empire and the Ottoman era. Now, once again, it will be a mosque. But Turkish officials say Christian emblems, including mosaics of the Virgin Mary which adorn its soaring golden dome, will not be removed. Making changes at Hagia Sophia is profoundly symbolic. It was Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, who decreed that it should be a museum. President Erdogan is now taking one more step to dismantle Ataturk's secular legacy, and remould Turkey according to his vision. The Turkish leader - who presents himself as a modern day conqueror - is making no apologies for the change. He says anyone who doesn't like it - and plenty abroad don't - is attacking Turkey's sovereignty. Reclaiming Hagia Sophia plays well with his base - religious conservatives - and with Turkish nationalists. Critics say he's using the issue to distract attention from the economic damage done here by the Covid19 pandemic. But many in the international community argue that the monument belongs to humanity - not to Turkey - and should have remained unchanged. They say it was a bridge between two faiths, and a symbol of co-existence. Shortly after the announcement, the first call to prayer was recited at Hagia Sophia and was broadcast on all of Turkey's main news channels. The cultural site's social media channels have now been taken down. What has the reaction been? Unesco has said it "deeply regrets" the decision to turn the museum into a mosque and called on the Turkish authorities to "open a dialogue without delay." The organisation had urged Turkey not to change its status without discussion. The head of the Eastern Orthodox Church has condemned the move, as has Greece - home to many millions of Orthodox followers. Culture Minister Lina Mendoni said it was an "open provocation to the civilised world". "The nationalism displayed by President Erdogan... takes his country back six centuries," she said in a statement. The court ruling "absolutely confirms that there is no independent justice" in Turkey, she added. But the Council of State, Turkey's top administrative court, said in its ruling on Friday: "It was concluded that the settlement deed allocated it as a mosque and its use outside this character is not possible legally." "The cabinet decision in 1934 that ended its use as a mosque and defined it as a museum did not comply with laws," it said. The Church in Russia, home to the world's largest Orthodox Christian community, immediately expressed regret that the Turkish court had not taken its concerns into account when ruling on Hagia Sophia. It said the decision could lead to even greater divisions. While the move is popular with conservative religious supporters of President Erdogan, Turkey's most famous author, Orhan Pamuk said the decision would take away the "pride" some Turks had in being a secular Muslim nation. "There are millions of secular Turks like me who are crying against this but their voices are not heard," he told the BBC. History of a global icon
By Joel GunterBBC News, Washington Overbooking on flights happens all the time. Airlines boost their profit margins by overselling, betting against the number of passengers who will miss their flights. In this case, the problem arose because United decided at the last minute to fly four members of staff to a connection point and needed to bump four passengers to make way for them. When there's a seating issue the first step is to offer an inducement to the passengers to take a later flight. On Sunday passengers were offered $400 (£322), a hotel room for the night and a flight the following afternoon. When no-one took the offer, the amount was upped to $800. Still no-one bit, so a manager boarded the flight and informed passengers that four people would be selected to leave the flight. That selection is based on several factors, but frequent fliers and higher fare-paying passengers are given priority to stay aboard, a spokeswoman for United confirmed. A couple who were selected agreed to leave the plane voluntarily. A third passenger, reportedly the wife of the man who was forcibly removed, also agreed. The man, who said he was a doctor and had to see patients in the morning, refused. At this point, the airline could have identified another passenger for removal or raised its offer anywhere up to a maximum of $1,350. Erin Benson, a spokeswoman for United, could not confirm whether other passengers were sought. She did confirm that no offer was made above $800, but could not comment on why. According to eyewitnesses, the man who refused to be ejected said he was a doctor and he had appointments to keep the following day, though this has not been confirmed. This was a Sunday night flight; the next flight on offer didn't leave until 15:00 on Monday. An eyewitness said the man was "very upset" about the possibility of being bumped and attempted to call his lawyer. An airline manager told him that security would be called if he did not comply. At this point, security officers came to speak to him, first one then two more. As the video shows, their conversation ended with the man being yanked from his seat onto the floor and dragged off, blood visible on this face. United is technically within its rights to forcibly remove the man for refusing to leave the flight, and the step is part of the airline's carriage guidelines, but such instances are extremely rare. Of the 613 million people who flew on major US carriers in 2015, 46,000 were involuntarily denied boarding, according to data from the Department of Transportation - less than 0.008%. The majority of those would have been informed before they boarded the flight, said Charles Leocha, the founder of passenger advocacy group Travelers United. He could not remember seeing a passenger violently dragged off a plane. "It turned my stomach," he said. Removing passengers at the last minute to make way for staff was also highly unusual, he said. Staff transport should be identified ahead of time and factored into bookings. US fliers have become resigned to chronic delays and poor service, according to Mr Leocha, and a lack of readily available information about their rights meant they were too dependent on the airline managers in situations like these. "Our expectations have been driven so low that passengers have begun to accept it," he said. "What they shouldn't have to accept is being dragged off the flight to make way for an employee." Oscar Munoz, CEO of United, said in a statement: "This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers." Mr Munoz said the airline would review the event and "reach out" to the passenger, though a spokeswoman could not confirm whether United was in touch with him yet. One of the security officers involved in the incident was suspended on Monday afternoon, pending a review, said the Chicago Department of Aviation in a statement. The actions of the officer were "obviously not condoned by the Department", the statement said. Whatever happened on the flight - and the details will undoubtedly emerge in the coming days - it was a bad day for United, Mr Leocha said. The airline had only recently been at the centre of another controversy, when a fortnight ago it refused to let two girls board because they were wearing leggings. "This isn't really a lesson for passengers it's a lesson for airlines," he said. "The only lesson here for passengers is when security get on throw up your hands, because otherwise you're going down the aisle with a fat lip."
The novelist was praised by the Swedish Academy as a writer "who, in novels of great emotional force, has uncovered the abyss beneath our illusory sense of connection with the world". His most famous novels The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go were adapted into highly acclaimed films. He was made an OBE in 1995. The 62-year-old writer said the award was "flabbergastingly flattering". He has written eight books, which have been translated into over 40 languages. When contacted by the BBC, he admitted he hadn't been contacted by the Nobel committee and wasn't sure whether it was a hoax. He said: "It's a magnificent honour, mainly because it means that I'm in the footsteps of the greatest authors that have lived, so that's a terrific commendation." He said he hoped the Nobel Prize would be a force for good. "The world is in a very uncertain moment and I would hope all the Nobel Prizes would be a force for something positive in the world as it is at the moment," he said. "I'll be deeply moved if I could in some way be part of some sort of climate this year in contributing to some sort of positive atmosphere at a very uncertain time." Who is Kazuo Ishiguro? His work, which includes scripts for film and television, looks at themes of memory, time and self-delusion. The Nobel committee praised his latest book The Buried Giant, which was released in 2015, for exploring "how memory relates to oblivion, history to the present, and fantasy to reality". Sara Danius, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, described his style as "a little bit like a mix of Jane Austen, comedy of manners and Franz Kafka". She said Ishiguro was a writer of "great integrity", adding: "He doesn't look to the side. He's developed an aesthetic universe all of his own." The Nobel comes with a prize of nine million kronor (£844,000, $1.1m). Kazuo Ishiguro's gift - by BBC arts editor Will Gompertz For me, he is one of the great living writers working in any language. All writers can tell stories. Ishiguro tells stories on another level. He places the reader in some sort of alternative reality - which might be the future, it might be the present, it might be the past. They feel like places that are whole and real, but you don't know them. They're weird and not necessarily happy places. But they're places that you can inhabit and relate to, and you become deeply involved with the characters. That's the writer's job - he just does it better than most. Read Will's full blog post.

The BBC understands that more than 60 VPNs were pulled over the weekend. Apple said it was legally required to remove them because they did not comply with new regulations. It refused to confirm the exact number of apps withdrawn, but did not deny the figure. It added that dozens of legal VPN apps were still available. One provider of the technology has said it will file an appeal with Apple. What is a VPN? VPNs allow users to mask their identity online by funnelling web browsing and other internet activity through another computer - sometimes one in a different country. As a result, users can hide their IP addresses and access online material that has been censored or blocked by their internet service provider. Which VPNs have been affected? A company that analyses mobile app sales, www.aso100.com, has told the BBC that more than 60 VPNs were no longer available in Apple's China mainland App Store. Golden Frog, the company that distributes VyprVPN was critical of the decision, saying it would file an appeal with Apple. "If Apple views accessibility as a human right, we would hope Apple will likewise recognize internet access as a human right (the UN has even ruled it as such) and would choose human rights over profits," said Golden Frog's president Sunday Yokubaitis in a blog post. ExpressVPN said it was "dismayed" that the tech giant had "sided with censorship." The apps are still available in Apple's App Stores outside China. Who uses VPNs in China and why? China has for many years censored content it sees as politically sensitive, using an increasingly sophisticated set of filters that critics have called the "great firewall." In its most recent rankings, the advocacy group Freedom House dubbed China "the year's worst abuser of internet freedom." VPNs allow users to skirt around these filters and gain access to websites and services that are restricted or banned. There is no outright ban on VPNs, and in fact many major corporations use them legitimately under the current laws. The latest push to tighten access has targeted VPNs that are mostly used by individuals rather than companies. Why did Apple remove the VPNs? In January, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology announced that all developers offering VPNs must obtain a license from the government. And Apple said it was required to remove some VPN apps from its store because they didn't comply with those regulations. But it is fair to say that Apple has many reasons to be wary of incurring Beijing's wrath. The tech giant makes much of its hardware in China, and it has become a major market for its products too. And with low cost local competitors cutting into the iPhone's market share, Apple's profits are more likely to depend on apps and services, some of which could run into China's censorship regime. Earlier this month Apple also established its first data centre in China, in conjunction with a local company Guizhou-Cloud Big Data Industry. Although Apple said it would retain the encryption keys and would not compromise users' privacy, some experts have suggested that housing data in China could create pressure for Apple to hand over data in future disputes. What else does China restrict? Recently, attachments such as voice messages and images stopped working on the messaging app WhatsApp. The Chinese government has not confirmed that this is part of a censorship push, but WhatsApp has not made any suggestion that it was merely a technical problem. Beijing blocks social media sites and apps, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Search engines like Google are blocked, and access to many foreign media outlets, including the BBC, is restricted. Recently, China blocked social media posts and even private messages and group chats about the death of Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. The government is expected to tighten restrictions ahead of the next communist party congress, where President Xi Jinping is tipped to retain the top job.
As many as 30 stores around the state are expected to start selling the drug for recreational purposes from 1 January, dubbed Green Wednesday. Colorado, along with Washington state, voted to legalise the use and possession of cannabis for people over the age of 21 in November 2012. Washington is not expected to allow the sale of it until later in 2014. Colorado and Washington are among 20 states to have approved marijuana use for medical purposes. The drug is still illegal under federal law. 'Who knows?' Store owners had stocked up, prepared celebrations and hired extra security in preparation for their opening on Green Wednesday. Under the new law, cannabis will be sold like alcohol. Residents will be able to buy up to one ounce, while those from out of the state can purchase up to a quarter of an ounce. Cannabis can only be smoked on private premises, with the permission of the owners. The sale of the drug will be taxed in the same way as alcohol, and state officials have said they expected it to raise millions - the first $40m of which will be used for school construction, The Denver Post reports. It was not clear exactly how many shops were expected to open on New Year's Day, though around 30 were listed by The Denver Post. A total of 136 stores have been given licences to sell marijuana. Most of the shops are based in Denver. Some communities elsewhere in Colorado have exercised their right not to have the stores. Supporters of legalising cannabis have praised Colorado's move. Rachel Gillette, of the Colorado branch of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, said the state "has found an exit strategy for the failed drug war and I hope other states will follow our lead". But critics say it sends the wrong message to the nation's youth and fear it will lead to serious public health and social problems. "There will still need to be a black market to serve people who are ineligible to buy on a legal market, especially kids," said Kevin Sabet of Smart Approaches to Marijuana. "It's almost the worst of both worlds."
The 134 Nobel laureates asked the new Communist Party head to release Liu, who has been jailed since 2009. A group of Chinese activists and writers also signed a letter urging Liu's release from inciting subversion. Meanwhile, Liu's wife has given her first interview since she was placed under house arrest two years ago. Activist Liu Xiaobo won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 despite the Chinese government's fierce opposition. He was sentenced in 2009 for helping to draft a manifesto - Charter '08 - calling for political change. He is serving 11 years in jail for inciting the subversion of state power. His wife, Liu Xia, told the Associated Press news agency her house arrest had been a painful experience. "I felt I was a person emotionally prepared to respond to the consequences of Liu Xiaobo winning the [Nobel] prize. But after he won the prize, I really never imagined that after he won, I would not be able to leave my home," she said. Her Beijing apartment has no internet or phone access. She is allowed out twice a week to buy groceries and visit her parents, and can see her husband once a month, she says. "I think Kafka could not have written anything more absurd and unbelievable than this," she said. 'Ending political imprisonment' The letters come four years after the Charter '08 manifesto and Liu's subsequent jailing. The Nobel laureates, who include the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, South African Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu and US writer Toni Morrison, made public the letter to Mr Xi on Tuesday. "As you have taken the first step towards assuming the presidency of the People's Republic of China, we write to welcome the prospect of fresh leadership and new ideas," they wrote. "To that end, we respectfully urge you to release Dr Liu Xiaobo, the world's only imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, and his wife, Liu Xia." Mr Xi, China's leader in waiting, was made Communist Party leader during its once-in-a-decade power transition last month. The Chinese writers, rights activists and lawyers also sent a letter echoing the laureates' sentiment, calling Liu's prison term "a brazen violation of citizens' basic rights". "We believe that the existence of political prisoners does not help China to build its image of a responsible world power," they said. "Ending political imprisonment is an important benchmark for China to move toward a civilised political system." At least 40 signed the letter when it was released on Tuesday, with the number reaching close to 300 on Thursday. Among those who signed the letter were legal scholar He Weifang, human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang and AIDS activist Hu Jia. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, responded to the letter sent by the Nobel laureates on Wednesday. "China is a law-abiding country. Liu Xiaobo was lawfully sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment by the judicial organ because he committed an offence against Chinese law," he said. "The Chinese government opposes outsiders handling matters in any way that would interfere in its judicial sovereignty and internal matters." On the other hand, he congratulated Mo Yan, who he said "loves his country and people". The letters come as Chinese writer Mo Yan prepares to receive his Nobel Prize for Literature in Sweden on Monday. While he has been criticised for not speaking out much on rights issues in China, he has previously called out for Liu Xiaobo to be freed "as soon as possible".
Some 400 works were bequeathed by Chinese art expert Professor Michael Sullivan, who died in September. Many of the pieces by late 20th Century and contemporary Chinese artists have never been seen in public. The works will be displayed on rotation at the Ashmolean in a gallery dedicated to Sullivan and his wife Khoan. Some of the paintings have been loaned to the museum since 2000. They were collected by the couple on their extensive travels to China from the 1940s. Much of the art was gained by the pair directly from the artists, and as gifts from those they made friends with. Among the most significant paintings are by Qi Baishi and Zhang Daqian, who both died in the mid-20th Century, and also include more recent acquisitions, including Landscript by Xu Bing, which was created in 2002. Sullivan retired to Oxford in 1985 after a career as the leading scholar on Chinese art outside the country. He continued to work in the field until shortly before his death, and was honoured with a lifetime achievement award from the American Friends of Shanghai Museum in 2012. BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz called the new acquisition "an extraordinary gift", adding that modern Chinese art is now the "hottest ticket in town". Curator of the collection, Dr Shelagh Vainker, said Sullivan collected through the 20th Century in every style. "He kept with it all the way and was still acquiring pieces this year," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Dr Vainker added that the collection came with a wealth of supporting material from Sullivan's archive, including correspondence with artists. This adds a great deal of context to the works and how they were acquired over the decades. "As a package, it's not just just the leading collection in the West, it's a unique resource for the whole subject," she said. "The whole field of Chinese art has exploded in the last decade," added Dr Vainker. Professor Christopher Brown, director of the Ashmolean, said he hoped the paintings will be "enjoyed by thousands of visitors and scholars from around the world". "We hope this is a fitting testament to a great art historian and collector," he added.
Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@KarishmaBBCon Twitter For Chinese shares though, the first trading session of 2016 has resulted in more of the same. More panic, more pessimism and more people selling their shares because of - well frankly, other people selling their shares. So why did Chinese shares fall by 7% today, causing trading to be halted? And what does it say about confidence in the Chinese market and more importantly - the economy? Here are four things you should know about the stock market falls in China today: Weaker manufacturing data This was what most analysts said was the reason behind why shares fell. Manufacturing data contracted again - for the tenth straight month. The figures are further demonstration of the ongoing narrative about China's economy, that state led investment into manufacturing is slowing down and that the economy is transitioning into services. China releases services data on Wednesday - which should show things are improving. Circuit breakers come into effect This was the first day that China's new "circuit breaker" came into effect, and that's why when shares plunged by 5% trading was halted by 15 minutes. When trading resumed, and shares continued to fall by 7%, trading was suspended altogether. The measures were created last year after the stock market crash in China, but only came into effect today. Circuit breakers in themselves aren't unusual - lots of countries have them for individual stocks, or for a few minutes - but it is unusual to stop trading altogether for a share fall of 7%. An indication perhaps of just how much the authorities want to avoid another crash. Yuan weakens again There was a sharp depreciation in the yuan just ahead of the plunge in Chinese shares. China cut the yuan's value against the dollar, making it weaker than 6.5 for the first time in more than four-and-a-half years. There's speculation that the People's Bank of China has abandoned trying to hold the yuan up against the dollar, which means it's signalling that it won't step in to shore up the yuan. There are concerns that this indicates money is flowing out of China, and that the fall could get out of control. Some investors may be worried about what would happen if the yuan continues to weaken - and the fact that policy makers are allowing it to weaken shows they're concerned about the economy's outlook too. People are selling because people are selling There's nothing like the herd mentality to get things started for the new year. Retail investors in the Chinese stock market are often driven by sentiment and tend to follow the crowd. When they hear of some bad news from brokers or their friends, and other people start selling - they start selling too. Falling prices attract more people to dump their stocks, and although shares are still above their lows, authorities will be keen to avoid the kind of share market crash we saw last summer. So what do today's falls tell you about the fate of the Chinese economy in 2016? Well, nothing you didn't know already. China is slowing down, people are nervous and that means volatile trading for the rest of the year. Happy New Year everyone. If the first day of trading is anything to go by, it is definitely going to be an interesting one.
The video was released at midnight and is available in 119 countries. UK fans will be able to download the track on Friday. Psy says he hopes it will be as successful as his debut from last year with a new dance. Psy's song Gangnam Style became the most-watched YouTube video of all time after its release last July. Gangnam Style has had one and a half billion YouTube hits, sold more than one million copies in the UK and was number one in more than 35 countries. The song was made internationally famous by it's unique "horse riding dance". Psy promised a "Psy style" take on a traditional Korean dance for the new Gentleman video. He told a South Korean TV news programme: "I've been working and reworking on it continuously. "This is another very rousing song. The dance is one known to all Koreans but new to foreigners. This will be presented in Psy style." Psy is set to perform the song for his Korean fans in his first concert performance of 2013 this weekend. Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter
A US delegation presented the UK with new evidence claiming to show security risks posed by using the Chinese firm. US President Donald Trump has sought to pressure Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the issue. A decision is expected this month on whether to allow Huawei to supply some "non-core" parts for the UK network. A US delegation led by deputy National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger met ministers in London on Monday. Senior US officials handed over a dossier of technical information which sources claim challenged British intelligence's own technical assessment that it would be possible to use Huawei in the 5G infrastructure without risks to national security. US sources refused to comment on the content of the file. The move is being seen as the latest round in an intense lobbying effort by the Trump administration as the UK government prepares to makes its decision on the 5G network. Last year, the US banned companies from selling components and technology to Huawei and 68 related companies, citing national security concerns. The US has previously warned that any use of Huawei would lead to a review of intelligence sharing. However, UK officials have suggested they are not worried that such a review would lead to any substantive change in behaviour. The head of MI5, Andrew Parker, told the Financial Times he has "no reason to think" the UK's intelligence-sharing relationship with the US would be adversely affected if Britain used Huawei technology. A Huawei spokesperson said: "We are a private company which has supplied 3G, 4G and broadband equipment to the UK's telecoms companies for 15 years. British experts are clear our technology does not pose a security risk." Meanwhile, Conservative MP Bob Seely has said Huawei "to all intents and purposes is part of the Chinese state" and a deal with the tech giant would allow Beijing to access the UK's network. He called on Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee to open an immediate investigation into the company's suitability to build parts of the UK's 5G infrastructure. A government spokesperson said: "The security and resilience of the UK's telecoms networks is of paramount importance." "The government continues to consider its position on high risk vendors and a decision will be made in due course."
But in his later years turned his attention closer to home, penning a book on the mindset of US President Donald Trump. Jerrold Post, a former political psychologist and author, died from complications related to coronavirus in late November at the age of 86. Those who knew him have paid tribute to his work. Magnus Ranstorp, a special advisor to the EU Radicalisation Awareness Network, described Post as "very gentle, kind and with a sharp mind". His friend psychologist Kenneth Dekleva said Post was a "giant in the field of leadership analysis and a CIA trailblazer". Jessica Case, a publisher with Pegasus Book who worked with him on his last book on President Trump, told the BBC: "His knowledge and insight into psychology were unmatched. He was endlessly curious." Analysing the minds of world leaders Post, born in 1934 in New Haven, attended Yale University, where he did his undergraduate degree, before heading to medical school. He then undertook his postgraduate psychiatric training at Harvard Medical School and the National Institute of Mental Health, according to the Washington Post. Post spent more than 20 years working at the CIA. He set up the agency's Centre for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behaviour in the early 1970s. "We looked at foreign leaders in their cultural and political context and gauged to what degree they were playing out personal conflicts on an international stage," he told Yale University. The unit analysed foreign leaders such as Cuba's Fidel Castro, Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi. Their assessments enabled presidents and high-profile officials to prepare for negotiations and crisis situations. Post wrote the "Camp David Profiles" of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin, which were said to have significantly influenced President Jimmy Carter's strategy for negotiations at Camp David - the US presidential retreat in Maryland - in 1978. The ensuing accords, signed by the two leaders, led directly to the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty. In his book Keeping Faith, Post said: "After Camp David, there was scarcely a major summit without our being asked to prepare profiles and assessments of the foreign leaders." Post was awarded the Intelligence Medal of Merit in 1979. He then went on to assume his position of director of the political-psychology programme at George Washington University's Elliott School of International Affairs. However, US government officials later called on Post again to help guide them in their decisions surrounding Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Speaking to the BBC in 2002, Post said Hussein had a "traumatic upbringing". Hussein fled his parent's home, who refused to give him and education, and went to live with his uncle who "filled him with these dreams of glory". Post said this cultivation of grandiose fantasy turned him into a "malignant narcissist". Analysing the US president Post wrote 14 books on a range of topics, from the mind of terrorists and the increase of politicians with narcissistic personalities. He faced some criticism during his career for diverging from the American Psychiatric Association's (APA) Goldwater Rule, which prohibits psychiatrists from commenting on the mental health of public figures, or diagnosing them, without examination and consent. However, Post argued that it was sometimes unethical to stay quiet. "I think there's a duty to warn," Post told The New Yorker in 2017. "Serious questions have been raised about the temperament and suitability of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named," he said about President Trump. In 2019, he took this idea further, co-writing a book with Stephanie Doucette titled: "Dangerous Charisma: The Political Psychology of Donald Trump and His Followers". In a interview with news site Salon ahead of the release of the book, he predicted Mr Trump's moves following the 2020 election. "Should Trump win, as he did in 2016, he will make it a much bigger win and talking [sic] about the fraudulent election support on the Democratic side. But should Trump lose narrowly, I think we can be assured that he will not concede early. "Trump may not even recognise the legitimacy of the election," he said. Following the book's publication, Post's health began to decline and he suffered a stroke in July. He spent his final weeks at home and died on 22 November, a week after testing positive for coronavirus.
An Australian analysis of all studies to date found that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduced the risk of squamous cell carcinoma by 18%. The drugs have previously been linked to a reduced risk of other cancers, including colon cancer. Experts said staying out of the sun and wearing sun cream were the most effective ways to avoid skin cancer. The theory that NSAIDs such as aspirin may protect against skin cancer has been raised before, but the overall evidence had been unclear. So researchers did an analysis of nine studies looking at use of the drugs and the risk of squamous cell carcinoma - the most common form of skin cancer. Reporting in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, they found that taking any NSAID was associated with an 18% lower risk of developing the cancer. And taking NSAIDs other than aspirin was linked with a 15% reduced risk. Side effects It is the most convincing evidence so far that the drugs help prevent the development of squamous cell carcinoma. But experts still cannot be sure of the effects because some factors - such as how much sun someone is exposed to or even what doses of the drugs they take - have been difficult to pin down with any accuracy. It is thought that NSAIDs, which also include diclofenac, may prevent skin cancer because they inhibit an enzyme called COX-2, which is involved in tumour development. The researchers did find a greater degree of reduced risk associated with use of the drugs in people with pre-cancerous growths or a history of skin cancer. It raises the possibility that the drugs could be used as a preventive treatment in some groups. Some people are prescribed NSAIDs long term for conditions such as arthritis, but they are not recommended for regular use in healthy people because of side effects, which can include, in rare cases, bleeding in the stomach. Prof Dorothy Bennett, an expert in cell biology, at St George's, University of London, said the results were worth knowing about. But the drugs' side effects would likely prevent their routine use in everyone. "Noting that most [squamous cell carcinomas] are curable by surgery if caught early, this reduction in risk is interesting, but it is hard to say whether it is worth taking action over it." Prof Brian Diffey, emeritus professor of photobiology, dermatological sciences at Newcastle University, said that reducing the risk of skin cancer by the same magnitude seen in the study could be done with a small reduction in sun exposure. "Given that long-term therapy with NSAIDs is not without risk, a safer option for those who wish to reduce their likelihood of skin cancer may be to spend a few minutes a day less outside."
Pakistan's PM Imran Khan earlier criticised India's move, warning "the world's eye is on Kashmir". Both leaders covered the tense situation in Kashmir in their independence day speeches, a day apart. The disputed territory has been the site of decades of sporadic conflict and is now in lockdown. A communications blackout in the region has made reporting from India-administered Kashmir difficult - but Mr Modi did not mention the restrictions in his speech. India celebrates Independence Day one day after Pakistan. The two separate states came into existence as a result of the partition of British India in 1947. What did the leaders say? Mr Modi criticised people at home who opposed the revocation of Article 370, accusing them of "playing politics", and said Kashmir will play an "important role" in India's development. He said Article 370, the constitutional provision that granted it special status, had only encouraged corruption. Mr Khan, meanwhile, used his speech to issue a warning: "Whatever was done during the curfew by India, we will tell the international community that you are responsible." "Whichever forum we get, I will be the ambassador and bring up Kashmir at every forum," he said. Many Kashmiris believe that Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist government's move is aimed at changing the demographics of the region by allowing other Indians to permanently settle there. The government denies this and has consistently framed its move as one made to facilitate economic development and security. Mr Modi said past governments had lacked the courage to take such a bold step because they were worried about their political future. "I don't care about my political future. For me, the country's future comes first." What else is happening in Kashmir? Kashmir has been in lockdown for more than a week now, with mobile, landline and internet networks cut off and curfew-like restrictions that ban people from assembling in crowds. However, officials said on Wednesday that these restrictions had now been eased in the Hindu-majority Jammu region. The BBC World Service, meanwhile, has stepped up its output on shortwave radio in Indian-administered Kashmir amid the communications shutdown. Broadcasts in English, Urdu, Hindi, Dari, and Pashto languages are available in the region, the BBC said. The Line of Control - the de facto border which marks the division of the parts of Kashmir administered by India and Pakistan - was the site of at least eight deaths, Pakistani officials said. Three soldiers died in Indian shelling across the Line of Control but return fire killed five on the Indian side, they said. Indian officials did not confirm those deaths, and Indian news agency ANI said Indian army officials had denied the claim - labelling the exchange of fire as "ceasefire violations" by Pakistan. Fire continues to be exchanged intermittently, Pakistan's armed forces said. Despite the security clampdown however, there have been protests against the revocation of Article 370, including one last Friday in Srinagar in the Muslim-majority Kashmir valley. It involved thousands of people coming out after midday prayers to demonstrate against the move. Thousands gathered in London outside the Indian High Commission to protest against the scrapping of Kashmir's special status on Thursday. Although Kashmir took centre stage during Mr Modi's Independence Day speech, the Indian prime minister also made several other important announcements. For the first time in the history of independent India, there will be a Chief of Defence Staff who will have authority over all three of India's armed forces. He also addressed the problem of single-use plastic items, urging people to reduce their usage, and referred to other issues such as water shortages, population control and healthcare.
By Anbarasan EthirajanBBC News, Yangon More than half a million Rohingya Muslims have fled across the border to Bangladesh since militants attacked police posts on 25 August, unleashing a massive military crackdown. The Burmese authorities have been under mounting pressure to end the violence, address instability in Rakhine, and grant humanitarian access. But the country's biggest city is a picture of calm on the surface, with clean roads, plenty of greenery and orderly - if congested - traffic. Well-dressed men and women get on with their daily lives. People here don't use the term Rohingya. They are portrayed in the media as "Bengali Muslims" and some even describe them as illegal Bengali immigrants from Bangladesh. When I have raised the Rohingya issue, people were either forthright in their opinion or tried to gloss over the topic, saying "there are many other issues in this country". This includes senior journalists, like U Aung Hla Tun, vice-chairman of the Myanmar Press Council. "The problem is the political motive behind the term [Rohingya]. I used to have a number of Bengali friends when I was young. They never claimed they were Rohingya… They first coined the term a few decades ago," he said. "They [Rohingya] do not belong to the ethnic minorities [of this country]. This is a fact." Rohingya and others dispute that. While the crisis has dominated headlines around the world for weeks, newspapers here have hardly any mention of the plight of Rohingya now living in squalid conditions in camps in Bangladesh. Instead, articles have given prominence to reports of the army finding mass graves of Hindus allegedly killed by Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa) militants. At the University of Yangon I wondered if I would find a different mood among students. Their links with the outside world through social media are much better than those from earlier generations. In the university café some students were reluctant to talk. Some did not want to give their names. But when I broached the Rakhine issue, the response was instant. "This issue is seen from outside as a religious problem. But it is not. The violence is an act of terrorism. The international community is getting wrong information about the situation in the Rakhine state," a female student said. "From abroad, you think you are right, but from our side we are right." Similar views were expressed by two of her friends. A few days later I went to a commemorative event marking the 10th anniversary of the 2007 pro-democracy protests. Thousands of Buddhist monks joined the demonstrations, which became widely known as "the Saffron Revolution". The pictures of saffron-clad monks revolting against the military junta caught the world's imagination. The anniversary event was held inside a monastery in southern Yangon, decorated with banners recalling the momentous protests. Buddhist monks, pro-democracy activists and union members who took part in the 2007 protests turned out in large numbers. I was expecting that as many of them were former political prisoners, who had been jailed for supporting human rights and democracy, there would have been a divergent view on the Rohingya issue. Shwe Toontay Sayar Taw was one of the leading monks in the Saffron Revolution. I asked him as a young democracy, isn't it Myanmar's responsibility to treat all communities, including the Rohingya, equally? "In democracy all are equal," he said, adding "but not terrorists". "If they take up terrorism [then] all the people of the world should unite to destroy terrorism. Otherwise they will destroy our generation." No doubt the Rohingya Muslim issue has boosted support among the majority Burmese for Aung San Suu Kyi, whose protracted silence over the issue has drawn condemnation from around the world. Rallies are held in front of the city hall in Yangon supporting the country's de-facto leader. Senior UN officials have described the violence against Rohingya Muslims as "ethnic cleansing" - a charge denied by the Myanmar government. Where have the Rohingya fled to? Myanmar has witnessed the mass exodus of people before. In the 1960s, soon after the military seized power, it ordered tens of thousands of people of Indian origin to leave the country. The Indians had lived in Burma for centuries, and many had been brought to the country by colonial rulers when the country was part of British India, during the 19th and early 20th Centuries. It is estimated that more than 300,000 people were forced to leave and their properties and lands were nationalised. The Burmese Indian refugees went back to India. I wondered whether Yangon and the mainstream Burmese media is in a state of denial about the violence against Rohingya Muslims. A senior editor and a former political prisoner who did not want to be named gave me the answer. "Everyone is scared and everyone is reluctant to touch on this issue. First, there is security problem in going there [Rakhine state]. So, much of the reporting is based only on official press releases," he said. He pointed out that there is also public pressure. If you go against the mainstream views, he said, "even your relatives and friends will dislike you".
Carrie GracieChina editor@BBCCarrieon Twitter Under the existing terms of the £18bn project, a Chinese company is to finance a third of the new Hinkley Point C reactors and may later build a Chinese-designed nuclear power station in Essex. So what's the difference between a French company and a Chinese one when it comes to the UK's critical infrastructure? How you answer that question depends on your assessment of China and its intentions. This is a fiendishly difficult calculation. China is a moving target, and a huge, contradictory and complex one at that. In 2016 it is already not the country that David Cameron faced when he became prime minister six years ago. and not the China that former George Osborne set out to woo for investment in the UK's infrastructure upgrade. Beijing is more powerful and its global agenda more assertive. At home, its political crackdown puts it increasingly at odds with British values. Should any of this matter? The UK already has a Chinese company, Huawei, running key parts of its telecommunications network. Arguably nuclear energy is likewise a business relationship subject to similar national security safeguards. But led by the United States, several other western countries have barred Huawei's involvement in key telecommunications networks on national security grounds. And no other major developed economy has invited Chinese involvement in a key nuclear energy project. 'Fear and greed' Two years ago the German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked her Australian counterpart what drove his country's policy on China, and he answered "fear and greed". In the absence of political change in China, this blunt assessment sums up the calculus for many countries, though the exact proportions of each differ depending on circumstance. Some in the British political and security establishment felt that under the previous government's declared "golden era" with China, there was not enough fear in London and too much greed. One such was the prime minister's joint chief of staff Nick Timothy. In comments which have received enormous scrutiny since Thursday night's surprise announcement that the Hinkley Point deal would be delayed, Mr Timothy wrote last October on the eve of the Chinese president's state visit to the UK: "Security experts - reportedly inside as well as outside government - are worried that the Chinese could use their role to build weaknesses into computer systems which will allow them to shut down Britain's energy production at will… "MI5 believes that 'the intelligence services of… China… continue to work against UK interests at home and abroad'." Is Mrs May worried? According to the former Business Secretary Vince Cable, the then home secretary did raise national security concerns about the Hinkley Point deal in cabinet. Sir Vince described Mrs May as "unhappy about the rather gung-ho approach to Chinese investment that we had, and that George Osborne in particular was promoting and, as I recall, raised objections to Hinkley at that time". Interestingly, Mrs May's less "gung ho" attitude on China was already evident in another dimension. As home secretary, she intervened personally when it emerged that the dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei had been granted only a 20-day visa to launch his exhibition at London's Royal Academy. Ms May overturned that decision, ordered a six-month visa and apologised to Mr Ai. So perhaps we will see a more nuanced policy to China under this new government. But this, too, is hard to get right. Some in the business and political community will remind Mrs May that her predecessor learned early what it was to feel Beijing's wrath when he ignored Chinese protests and met the Dalai Lama in 2012. As a result, no senior figure in the British government was invited to China for the following 18 months - and when Mr Cameron did finally visit, it was after George Osborne had wrested control of UK-China policy from the more cautious Foreign Office to launch what he called "the next big step", a very business-oriented relationship which culminated in President Xi's state visit to the UK last October. It's worth remembering that the Hinkley Point deal was the centrepiece of that visit, the symbol of the "golden era" in relations that both governments hoped to launch. And Beijing has good reason for investing political capital in the nuclear energy relationship. China has more than 30 nuclear power stations at home and nearly as many under construction. Exporting its nuclear technology is now the priority, and although it has customers like Pakistan in the developing world, the UK's track record and internationally respected safety regime would make it a hugely valuable showcase. The price of making China angry China's embassy in London said on Saturday that Chinese involvement in Hinkley Point is a "win-win", and UK enthusiasts insists Chinese technology is cheap and safe and that China has too much at stake to want to "shut down Britain's energy production at will", as Mr Timothy put it. But if at the end of her review, Mrs May does decide she's unsure about future Chinese intentions and wants to renegotiate, what will happen? Could she have Chinese investment for Hinkley Point without any strings attached about a Chinese-designed and built nuclear power station down the line? At this point, we just don't know, but one answer may be no, and if she then walks away, she risks making China angry. Now that would cause problems for another stated government goal. Mrs May is only prime minister because of the Brexit vote, and in a world where the UK stands outside the European Union, it may want to work harder at its economic relationship China. Last weekend, Chancellor Philip Hammond was in Beijing and raised the possibility of a free trade agreement. If Chinese pique over a reverse on nuclear energy landed the British government back on what many in Whitehall called China's "naughty step", trade negotiations would go into the freezer and howls of protest would follow from those in the business community who were hoping to realise Mr Osborne's "golden decade" in economic relations. It's possible that Mrs May won't get to this point in her reassessment, but if she does, she may reflect that if China is minded to exact a price for a change of heart on a business deal, the price for other differences of opinion might become unacceptably high if the same China was in control of a British nuclear power station. Which then brings the prime minister to the question of how other world leaders manage difficulties in their relationship with China. Size and strategic dominance puts the United States in a different class, but there's an interesting model closer to home. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel manages to have a close and profitable business relationship with Beijing at the same time as being much more robust in defence of German interests, and much more vocal on other issues like China's territorial assertiveness and its crackdown on human rights and freedom of speech. In Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, Chinese leaders have grown used to British partners who kept most differences behind closed doors, whether on steel dumping, Hong Kong, locking up lawyers or the South China Sea. It would be an ironic twist if one result of the Brexit vote was a reset of UK China policy which put that policy back in line with its more robust EU partners. China's calculus A month ago, Brexit looked like one set of problems for China, mostly focused on economic fears. Now with her Hinkley Point pause, Ms May has delivered a wholly new set of problems. But while Chinese leaders may not like the unpredictable and inconvenient U-turns in policy and style that come with messy democracies, they are increasingly adept at handling them. From the United States to Sri Lanka and Myanmar, Beijing plays a long and pragmatic game when it comes to new governments. So China liked the Cameron-Osborne team and got used to the chancellor calling the tune on UK-China policy. But with this signal that key decision making has moved from No 11 to No 10 Downing St, Beijing will be working hard to map the players in the May team, and when the prime minister finishes her assessment of the Hinkley Point deal and announces the outcome, you can be sure Beijing will be ready for her.
By Heather ChenBBC News Already one of China's most popular athletes, the former NBA superstar from New York, is believed to be the first foreign celebrity to receive permanent residency. He broke the news earlier this month in a post on his official Weibo microblog page. "Being the first foreign basketball player to receive a green card means a lot in making history in China," he wrote. "I'm so blessed and thankful to receive my Chinese green card. I feel like my love for China is being shown in the same way." A difficult permit to get China's green card policy was introduced in 2004 and is a notoriously difficult permit to obtain because of the stringent requirements for residency. Earlier this year however, Chinese media reported the government had eased rules and procedures, in a move to attract foreign investment. Applicants are required to hold professional titles and have made "outstanding contributions" to China. They must have worked in the country for more than four years and have sound tax records. Officials say that only 5,000 foreigners were granted permanent residency between 2004 and 2013. There are an estimated 600,000 foreigners in the country. Stephon Marbury became one of these in 2010, when he wrapped up his career in the NBA and joined the world of Chinese basketball. 'Welcome to Beijing' Chinese fans on Weibo welcomed him to the club. "China welcomes all forms of talent to our shores," said Weibo user Fan Hui Han. "We love the sport that you champion and it is truly an honour to call you one of our own." "You have brought unprecedented glory to all of us in Beijing! This is the best way we can repay you," commented a user in the capital. Another said: "Welcome to Beijing! Few foreigners have embraced our country and culture like you have. China loves and supports you." From NBA to CBA Mr Marbury was an NBA All-Star player in 2001 and 2003. He has played with several basketball teams including the New York Knicks, Phoenix Suns and the New Jersey Nets. Since he arrived in China, he has led the Beijing Ducks to national victory, winning three Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) championships. This year, China immortalised Mr Marbury with an arena statue, and he got his own postage stamp in April. Earlier this week, a museum dedicated to the star opened in Beijing, displays photos of his US career and now his life in China. "Today was one of the best days of my life in opening my own museum," he wrote on his Weibo page. "I couldn't have dreamed this dream for myself although God has created another miracle in this life for me." He also added: "Without my teammates, coaches and fans from Beijing, this wouldn't be possible." Basketball is a national obsession among many fans in China, where it has often been referred to as the country's "true" national sport. US basketball stars like Kobe Bryant, Dennis Rodman and American-Chinese player Jeremy Lin all have official accounts on Weibo - China's popular and regulated microblogging platform.
They met little resistance in contrast to Monday, when there were clashes. French police have warned that they will use force if the migrants refuse to move to nearby shipping containers. But many migrants fear they will be required to claim asylum in France and give up hope of travelling to Britain. French authorities believe about 1,000 migrants will be affected by the eviction plan while aid agencies say the number of people living there is much higher. On Tuesday, riot police entered the camp with shields, batons, helmets and tear gas - prepared for trouble, but meeting little resistance, reports the BBC's Anna Holligan in Calais. They were followed by bulldozers, which cleared away wooden pallets, blankets and debris. Those living in the camp, mainly from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa, hope to cross the Channel to the UK, often using people traffickers to try to enter illegally. About 100 shacks were dismantled on Monday. At least 12 shelters were set ablaze. 'Borders of pain' - media analysis by BBC Monitoring In France, the camp clearance is generally not on the front pages, although regional daily La Voix du Nord is headlined "Jungle set ablaze". National paper Le Figaro has a feature on migrants who are so fed up with the life in the Jungle that they want to go home. "We're treated like animals. We're slowly dying," Afghan Nasrat says. In Germany, the papers focus on Monday's storming of the Greek-Macedonian border and the continuing debate over Chancellor Angela Merkel's liberal migration policy. "Europe's pain threshold," says a headline in Die Welt, using a word that also translates as "borders of pain". "Athens loses control over refugees," says Sueddeutsche Zeitung, arguing in a in a commentary that the "suffering" on display in Greece vindicates Mrs Merkel's approach, while an article in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung believes Ms Merkel is failing to win over the other EU states and Turkey. The story is also well covered in Russia, whose government - according to some - sees the refugee crisis as a way to sow division in the EU. On Monday, under cover of darkness, migrants tried to access lorries on the motorway heading towards the port. French media say about 150 people, some wielding sticks and iron bars, walked on to the road to block vehicles. Riot police fired tear gas, forcing them back, our correspondent reports. In pictures: Anger as 'Jungle' cleared At least four people, including activists from the UK-based No Borders group, were arrested during Monday's unrest, police say. Earlier, Good Chance, a theatre group which works in the camp, said police were stopping volunteers from entering the camp. French officials say public areas such as places of worship or schools will not be affected. They describe the clearance as a "humanitarian operation". Conditions in the southern sector are squalid and the camp's sprawling presence has become a controversial issue in both France and the UK. The Jungle in numbers Tea, rivalry and ambition at 'Jungle hotel' Jungle migrants prepare to move Migrants resist relocation to containers Officials say migrants can either move into converted containers in the northern sector of the camp, where there is room for 1,500 people; move to similar accommodation centres elsewhere in France; or claim asylum in France. But many residents are reluctant to leave the Calais area. Afghan migrant Hayat Sirat told AP news agency: "Going to Britain... is what people [here] want. So destroying part of the Jungle is not the solution." Are you in the area? Have you been affected by the evictions? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk with your stories if it is safe to do so.

Ginsburg died on Friday of metastatic pancreatic cancer at her home in Washington, DC, surrounded by her family, the statement said. Earlier this year, Ginsburg said she was undergoing chemotherapy for a recurrence of cancer. A prominent feminist, she became a figurehead for liberals in the US. Ginsburg was the oldest justice and the second ever woman to sit on the Supreme Court, where she served for 27 years. "Our Nation has lost a jurist of historic stature," Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement on Friday. "We at the Supreme Court have lost a cherished colleague. Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her - a tireless and resolute champion of justice." As one of four liberal justices on the court, her health was watched closely. Ginsburg's death raises the prospect of Republican US President Donald Trump trying to expand the court's slender conservative majority, even before this November's election. In the days before her death, Ginsburg expressed her strong disapproval of such a move. "My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed," she wrote in a statement to her granddaughter, according to National Public Radio (NPR).. President Trump is expected to nominate a conservative replacement for Ginsburg as soon as possible, White House sources told BBC partner CBS News. Mr Trump reacted to Ginsburg's death after an election rally in Minnesota, saying: "I didn't know that. She led an amazing life, what else can you say?" Later on, Mr Trump said Ginsburg was a "titan of the law" and a "brilliant mind", in a tweeted statement. Ginsburg had suffered from five bouts of cancer, with the most recent recurrence in early 2020. She had received hospital treatment a number of times in recent years, but returned swiftly to work on each occasion. In a statement in July, the judge said her treatment for cancer had yielded "positive results", insisting she would not retire from her role. "I have often said I would remain a member of the Court as long as I can do the job full steam," she said. "I remain fully able to do that." Why was Ginsburg important? US Supreme Court justices serve for life or until they choose to retire, and supporters had expressed concern that a more conservative justice could succeed Ginsburg. The highest court in the US is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. In recent years, the court has expanded gay marriage to all 50 states, allowed for President Trump's travel ban to be put in place, and delayed a US plan to cut carbon emissions while appeals went forward. Ginsburg's death will spark a political battle over who will succeed her, spurring debate about the future of the Supreme Court ahead of November's presidential election. President Trump has appointed two judges since taking office, and the current court is seen to have a 5-4 conservative majority in most cases. The US Senate has to approve a new judge nominated by the president. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Friday evening that if a nominee was put forward before the election, there would be a vote on Mr Trump's choice. But Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden said: "There is no doubt - let me be clear - that the voters should pick the president and the president should pick the justice for the Senate to consider." A high-stakes political fight looms Ginsburg's death injects a level of unpredictability into a presidential race that had been remarkably stable for months. Now, not only will the White House be at stake in November, but the ideological balance of the Supreme Court could be, as well. It all depends on what President Trump and the Republicans choose to do next. They could try to fill the seat before the end of the year regardless of who wins the presidency in November, replacing a liberal icon with what in all likelihood will be a reliable conservative vote. Or they could wait and hold the seat vacant, a prize to encourage conservative voters - particularly evangelicals who see an opportunity to roll back abortion rights - to flock to the polls for the president. Filling the seat would outrage Democrats, who will note that Republicans denied former President Barack Obama the chance to fill the vacant seat in 2016 for months. Waiting, on the other hand, would risk letting Biden name Ginsburg's replacement in 2021. All signs point to Republicans trying the former. Concerns of hypocrisy will melt away when a lifetime appointment to the court is in play. Either way, it sets up a brutal, high-stakes political fight that comes at a time when the nation is already rife with partisan discord and psychological distress. Read more from Anthony What is Ginsburg's legacy? Over an illustrious legal career spanning six decades, Ginsburg attained unparalleled celebrity status for a jurist in the US, revered by liberals and conservatives alike. Liberal Americans in particular idolised her for her progressive votes on the most divisive social issues that were referred to the Supreme Court, from abortion rights to same-sex marriages. Born to Jewish immigrant parents in Brooklyn, New York City, in 1933, Ginsburg studied at Harvard Law School, where she was one of only nine women in a class of about 500 men. Ginsburg did not receive a single job offer after graduation, despite finishing top of her class. Nevertheless, she persisted, working in various jobs in the legal profession throughout the 1960s and far beyond. In 1972, Ginsburg co-founded the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). That same year, Ginsburg became the first tenured female professor at Columbia Law School. In 1980, Ginsburg was nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia as part of then-President Jimmy Carter's efforts to diversify federal courts. Though Ginsburg was often portrayed as a liberal firebrand, her days on the appeals court were marked by moderation. She was appointed to the Supreme Court by former President Bill Clinton in 1993, becoming only the second of four female justices to be confirmed to the court. Toward the end of her life, Ginsburg became a national icon. Due in part to her withering dissents, Ginsburg was dubbed the Notorious RBG by her army of fans online - a nod to the late rapper The Notorious BIG. That comparison introduced Ginsburg to a new generation of young feminists, turning her into a cult figure. What reaction has there been? Former presidents, veteran politicians and senior jurists were among those to mourn the loss of Ginsburg on Friday, hailing her commitment to women's rights. Jimmy Carter called her a "truly great woman", writing in a statement: "A powerful legal mind and a staunch advocate for gender equality, she has been a beacon of justice during her long and remarkable career. I was proud to have appointed her to the US Court of Appeals in 1980." Praising her "pursuit of justice and equality", former President George W Bush said Ginsburg "inspired more than one generation of women and girls". Hillary Clinton, a Democrat who ran against President Trump in the 2016 presidential election, said she drew inspiration from Ginsburg. Conservative politicians also paid their respects. "It was with great sadness that I learned of the passing of Justice Ginsburg," Republican Senator Lindsay Graham said on Twitter. "Justice Ginsburg was a trailblazer who possessed tremendous passion for her causes. She served with honour and distinction as a member of the Supreme Court." Eric Trump, the son of President Trump, said Ginsburg was "a remarkable woman with an astonishing work ethic". "She was a warrior with true conviction and she has my absolute respect! #RIP," he wrote on Twitter. Within hours of the news emerging, hundreds of people had gathered outside the Supreme Court in Washington DC to pay their respects. The BBC's Alexandra Ostasiewicz at the scene said the mood was sombre but the crowd occasionally broke into chants of "RBG!" and "Vote him out!".
Writing in a US medical journal, they called on the WHO to heed lessons from the Ebola outbreak and convene an emergency committee of disease experts. They said a vaccine might be ready for testing in two years but it could be a decade before it is publicly available. Zika, linked to shrunken brains in children, has caused panic in Brazil. Thousands of people have been infected there and it has spread to some 20 countries. The Brazilian President, Dilma Roussef, has urged Latin America to unite in combating the virus. She told a summit in Ecuador that sharing knowledge about the disease was the only way that it would be beaten. A meeting of regional health ministers has been called for next week. Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Daniel R Lucey and Lawrence O Gostin say the WHO's failure to act early in the recent Ebola crisis probably cost thousands of lives. They warn that a similar catastrophe could unfold if swift action is not taken over the Zika virus. "An Emergency Committee should be convened urgently to advise the Director-General about the conditions necessary to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern," Mr Lucey and Mr Gostin wrote. They added: "The very process of convening the committee would catalyze international attention, funding, and research." White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Wednesday the US government intended to make a more concerted effort to communicate with Americans about the risks associated with the virus. No cure There is no cure for the virus and the hunt is on for a vaccine, led by scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch. The researchers have visited Brazil to carry out research and collect samples and are now analysing them in a suite of high-security laboratories in Galveston, Texas. Access to the building in Galveston is tightly controlled by police and the FBI. Speaking to the BBC inside the facility, Professor Scott Weaver, director of the Institute for Human Infections and Immunity, said people were right to be frightened by the virus. "It's certainly a very significant risk," he said, "and if infection of the foetus does occur and microcephaly develops we have no ability to alter the outcome of that very bad disease which is sometimes fatal or leaves children mentally incapacitated for the remainder of their life." The Zika virus was discovered in monkeys in 1947 in Uganda's Zika Forest, with the first human case registered in Nigeria in 1954 but for decades it did not appear to pose much of a threat to people and was largely ignored by the scientific community. It was only with an outbreak on the Micronesian island of Yap in 2007 that some researchers began to take an interest. In the past year the virus "exploded" said Prof Weaver, sweeping through the Caribbean and Latin America "infecting probably a couple of million people". The symptoms in adults and children are similar to those for dengue fever but generally milder, including flu-like aches, inflammation of the eyes, joint pain and rashes although some people have no symptoms at all. In rare cases the disease may also lead to complications including Guillain-Barre syndrome, a disorder of the nervous system which can cause paralysis.

The RMT and TSSA union members started a 48-hour walk out at 21:00 GMT. The unions want TfL to suspend its plans to close all ticket offices and cut 950 jobs. The authority has said the measures are needed to modernise and save £50m a year. London Underground plans to run a limited service until Friday morning. 'Deeply regrettable' In addition, Network Rail has put in place a 40mph speed restriction across parts of the Southeastern network until Wednesday evening because of a risk of further flooding, landslips and falling trees. On Twitter, Prime Minister David Cameron said the "shameful" strike would bring "misery to millions of Londoners". In response, an RMT representative said Mr Cameron should get mayor Boris Johnson to stick to his election promise to Londoners not to close ticket offices. Labour's leader Ed Miliband said the strike should not go ahead and it was "deeply regrettable" that no negotiation or meetings with the mayor and TfL seemed to have happened. On Monday, the conciliation service Acas said seven days of talks had ended without agreement. Since then, in a phone conversation on LBC radio, RMT union leader Bob Crow told London Mayor Boris Johnson the strike would be suspended if the job cuts were withdrawn. Mr Johnson urged union leaders to begin negotiating, telling BBC London the strike would "make absolutely no difference to the long-term future of their members". He has said there will be no compulsory redundancies. 'Frankly embarrassing' The strikes will affect all Underground lines with only limited services expected on the following: Around 100 extra buses will be laid on, while normal services will run on London Overground and Tramlink. Fans going to the O2 Arena in Greenwich to see singer Taylor Swift experienced disruption to their journeys. And some supporters at the Fulham v Sheffield United FA Cup match at Craven Cottage had to find alternative routes home. Simon Thomas, chief executive of Hippodrome Casino in Leicester Square, said it was "frankly embarrassing" that the ICE gaming industry exhibition at the ExCeL Centre would be disrupted by the industrial action. He said: "Gaming industry executives from across the world are in London this week and it is outrageous that this strike is being held." Dave Jacobs, from Southend in Essex, said his wife would be unable to leave hospital in Chelsea, west London, where she is being treated this week because she would not be able to complete the District Line journey. He said: "This is the 21st Century and offices are no longer needed if machines can do the job. Roll with the times Mr Crow." The second 48-hour walkout is due to begin at 21:00 GMT on 11 February.
Jean-Claude Juncker said the lack of a "permanent structure" resulted in money being wasted on missions. Part of his annual state of the union address was devoted to the UK's unexpected vote to leave the EU. He insisted that the bloc was not at risk but called for Brexit negotiations to take place as quickly as possible. Modelled on the state of the union address by the US president, the Commission president's annual speech was introduced in 2010 to detail the state of the EU and future legislative plans. Won't a common military force interfere with Nato? The Brexit vote has given added impetus to plans for greater defence co-operation, because the UK has always objected to the potential conflict of interest with Nato. But Mr Juncker said a common military force "should be in complement to Nato". "More defence in Europe doesn't mean less transatlantic solidarity." A European Defence Fund would stimulate military research and development, he said. Why a military HQ? By BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus All EU members have military forces; most are also members of Nato; and several have extensive experience of operations abroad, from peace-keeping to war-fighting. The real question is how to organise these component parts to get greater security. Mr Juncker insists that the EU must have a role here. He wants to improve EU command and control facilities and appears to be suggesting that EU civil and military aspects of a given mission should be run out of the same headquarters. He also insists that whatever the EU does it should not detract from Nato. But defence resources are finite. His critics will say nothing should be done that duplicates existing Nato activities, as that sends a signal of disarray in Western ranks to Moscow. Read more here: Brexit vote revives dream of EU army Europe's media unimpressed by Juncker What sort of missions does the EU run? Since 2003 the EU has launched some 30 civilian and military operations in Europe, Africa and Asia - under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Sixteen are still going on, including six military operations:: What did we learn on Brexit? On future Brexit negotiations, Mr Juncker warned that the UK could only have unlimited access to the single market if it accepted free movement of people and goods. "There can be no a la carte access to the single market," he said. The single market has dominated the Brexit debate in the UK. Prime Minister Theresa May distanced herself last week from remarks by Brexit minister David Davis, when he said remaining in the single market would be "very improbable" if it meant giving up control of British borders. What was Juncker's main message? By BBC Europe Editor Katya Adler Jean-Claude Juncker and his team agonised over the wording of Wednesday's speech. The UK's vote to leave the EU is undoubtedly one of the biggest crises the bloc has ever faced but Mr Juncker was determined not to dwell on it. There were few words on Brexit. His main message: "The European project continues. Let's choose to look forward. Be positive." Applause resounded around the chamber of the European Parliament but how will the voters outside react? Are they even listening? The drumbeat of nationalist, Eurosceptic populism reverberates around the continent. Public trust in the establishment is low - whether traditional politicians, bankers or EU bureaucrats - and Mr Juncker is an unelected president. Brexit: All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU What else did he say? Mr Juncker admitted the EU was facing an "existential crisis", and he also warned that splits in the union had left space for "galloping populism". In a blunt criticism of recent attacks on immigrants in the UK, he said he would "never accept Polish workers being beaten up, harassed or even murdered on the streets of Essex". Mr Juncker said the EU had to deliver "concrete results" including: He urged a renewed focus on the EU as a "driving force that can bring about unification, for instance in Cyprus". How did MEPs react? Anti-EU MEPs lined up to criticise Mr Juncker's rallying cry:
Nuon Chea, 86, is on trial for genocide and crimes against humanity. The deputy leader under Pol Pot's regime was responding to questions from family members of those who died, at the UN-backed tribunal in Phnom Penh. Fellow defendant Khieu Samphan, the regime's former head of state, also issued a rare apology to relatives. Up to two million people are believed to have died during the four years of Khmer Rouge rule from 1975-1979. Those believed to be enemies of the regime were tortured and killed, while hundreds of thousands more died from starvation or overwork because of policies that emptied the cities and forced people into the fields. The regime's leader, Pol Pot, died in the late 1990s and to date, only one senior-level Khmer Rouge figure has been convicted of crimes committed during that era. Both Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan have said in the past that they believed they were acting in the best interests of the nation and had been unaware of the full extent of killings under the regime. Speaking in Phnom Penh on Thursday after representatives of ordinary people whose families were killed addressed the tribunal, Nuon Chea said he was not trying to avoid blame. "As a leader, I must take responsibility for the damage, the danger to my nation," he said, offering "deepest condolences" to relatives of those who died. "I feel remorseful for the crimes that were committed intentionally or unintentionally, whether or not I had known about it or not known about it," he later added. Khieu Samphan also offered a "sincere apology" to the court, but - like Nuon Chea - said he was "not aware of the heinous acts committed by other leaders that caused tragedy for the nation and people". Tribunal spokesman Lars Olsen welcomed the statements, saying: "Many victims have waited more than 30 years to hear any statement of apology or regret from leadership figures in the Khmer Rouge." To date, the only top official convicted in connection with crimes committed under the Khmer Rouge regime is chief jailer Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch. He was sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in running the notorious Tuol Sleng prison, where thousands of inmates were killed. Two other top officials were to be tried but one, former foreign minister Ieng Sary, died in March. His wife, Ieng Thirith, was ruled incapable of standing trial because of illness. Rights groups and campaigners have criticised the pace of the trial and voiced fears that the age of its remaining two defendants may mean that justice is not served.
The Australian citizen has been held in Beijing since January under "harsh conditions", said the foreign ministry. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Australia was "very concerned and disappointed" to learn of the arrest. "We have serious concerns for Dr Yang's welfare, and about the conditions under which he is being been held," she said. Mr Yang's supporters told the BBC that the formal arrest, on 23 August, was an expected but concerning development in his case. He had been held without charge for more than seven months, during which time Canberra repeatedly pressed Beijing to release him. In an interview with The Guardian newspaper, Ms Payne explicitly denied the allegations of espionage. "There is no basis for any allegation Dr Yang was spying for the Australian government," she said. Earlier, she had said that the reason for his detention had not been explained. "I respectfully reiterate my previous requests that if Dr Yang is being held for his political beliefs, he should be released." China's foreign ministry, meanwhile, told Australia not to interfere. Despite Mr Yang's Australian citizenship, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters: "The Australian side should earnestly respect China's judicial sovereignty and must not intervene in any way to China's handling of the case." Who is Yang Hengjun? Mr Yang, a novelist and former Chinese diplomat, had lived outside his home country for more than a decade but maintained a popular blog on Chinese current affairs and international relations. He was active on Chinese social media and Twitter, where he had more than 130,000 followers and was known as "the democracy peddler". But he had not been directly critical of Chinese authorities in recent years. In January, the New York-based writer travelled to China with his wife Yuan Ruijuan and her child - both Chinese citizens - where he was detained at the airport in Guangzhou. Beijing has held him for alleged "involvement in criminal activities endangering China's national security" ever since. His supporters say he has been subject to continuous interrogation under "residential surveillance" - a term often used when Chinese investigators hold a suspect in an unknown location. His wife, Yuan Ruijuan, is still in China and is banned from leaving. "It has had a huge impact, everyone is shattered. I've lost about five kilograms," she said. "I've been diagnosed with depression by hospital. His older sister is also broken, and can't sleep or eat. The whole family has collapsed, and can't believe it. "But they are not surprised either, because he had been writing articles that are related to politics in recent years, his family had always feared that this day would come, but they never thought they would arrest him on such charges." What is happening now? China has allowed Australian consular officials to visit Mr Yang, but he has been denied access to his family and lawyers. He is expected to be moved to a state prison now he has been charged, his supporters say. On Tuesday, Australia reiterated its expectations that he would be treated "in accordance with international human rights law". Beijing has not provided any comment on Mr Yang's detention. His friend, Sydney academic Feng Chongyi, told the BBC he believed he had been subject to torture and inhumane treatment during detention. "Yang is a brave person and psychologically very strong," Mr Feng said. "He has already withstood the torture and interrogation of the past seven months and not given in. I think he would be ready to face any form of punishment dealt to him by the Chinese government." He suggested Mr Yang's arrest was part of a renewed crackdown by Beijing on Chinese democracy activists and writers abroad. "Because he had a sizeable influence online, he was targeted. Whatever happens to him now all depends on the pressure exercised by the Australian government and the international community," Mr Feng said. He also likened Mr Yang's situation to the cases of Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were detained just a few weeks before Mr Yang. They were formally arrested for spying in May. China has denied the detention of the two men is tied to Canada's arrest of a senior Huawei official, Meng Wanzhou, but many analysts have characterised it as a tit-for-tat action.
The pair are reported to have taken home an estimated $95 million (£59 million) in the last year. Jay Z's recent Watch the Throne album went platinum and launched a world tour that brought in $1.4m (£900,000) per night in America, according to Forbes. Beyonce's Mrs Carter world tour is estimated to have taken in an average of $2m (£1.3m) per night. In addition to his music career, Jay Z also part-owns the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, which he will be selling now he has started his own sports agency, Roc Nation Sports. Beyonce has her own fragrance and clothing lines. Second on the list are American footballer Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen, who took home $80m (£50m). Gisele was recently named the highest-earning model and she is thought to have made $4m (£2.5m) more than her husband, who recently signed a $30m (£18.7m) contract with the New England Patriots. Actors Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt complete the top three with earnings of $50m (£31.2m). To compile its list, Forbes estimated the entertainment-related income of celebrities between June 2012 and June 2013 by talking to agents, managers, producers and executives. Fourth on the list are Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, who originally met on the set of That '70s Show. They are estimated to have earned $30m (£18.7m). He is now the highest-paid actor on television thanks to his role in US comedy Two and a Half Men. Kanye West and Kim Kardashian are also thought to have made $30m (18.7m) as a couple. Kim, who recently gave birth to the couple's first child, is said to have earned $10m (£6.2m). Kanye West's latest album Yeezus was released too late to include its earnings in the figures.

Apple says it is one of several apps to have been removed after the government said it does not comply with local law. Skype owner Microsoft told the BBC the app had been "temporarily removed" and the company was "working to reinstate the app as soon as possible". The app is also no longer available for download on Android app stores in China. Media reports suggest the disruption to Skype started in October. Apple said in a statement: "We have been notified by the Ministry of Public Security that a number of voice over internet protocol apps do not comply with local law." "Therefore these apps have been removed from the app store in China." Meanwhile, a Microsoft spokesperson said: "The iOS version of Skype has been temporarily removed from the app store in China... we're passionate about the benefit that Skype offers to our users around the world by facilitating communication and enabling collaboration." The company declined to comment on when its Skype app was first removed, or the situation with Android. Tests by BBC staff in China found Skype was not available for download on Apple or Android app stores on Wednesday. The tech giant has come under criticism before for withdrawing products from its Chinese App Store. In July, creators disapproved when the tech giant took down more than 60 virtual private networks (VPNs) which circumvent China's internet firewall because it was "legally required to remove them" under Chinese regulations. On Tuesday, Apple revealed that it had removed 674 VPN apps so far this year following a request by the Chinese government. In a letter to two US senators, the firm said it had been "ordered" to remove specific VPN apps even though it "questioned the legal basis of the request". Apple said it was told the VPN operators had violated Chinese cyber security laws. Those laws are seen as part of efforts to control public opinion and eliminate anti-government sentiment on the internet in China, and have raised concerns from foreign companies trying to expand their user base in China. Correspondents say that Skype, when downloaded from outside China's firewall, has been seen as a semi-secure way of discussing sensitive topics away from the eyes and ears of China's state security. Skype is just the latest in a string of foreign owned digital and internet platforms - including Alphabet's Google, Facebook and Twitter - which have become unavailable to Chinese users.
The Studio Ghibli film grossed $27.7m (£21.8m), according to Maoyan, China's largest movie ticketing app. Spirited Away was officially released in 2001, but only now, 18 years later, has it been released in China. However, many Chinese viewers grew up with the film, having watched DVDs or pirated downloads. Toy Story 4 made $13.2m on its opening weekend, said consultancy firm Artisan Gateway. The Japanese film by famed director Hayao Miyazaki tells the story of a young girl who is transported into a fantasy world after entering an abandoned theme park with her parents. The movie gained a cult following after it was released and still remains Studio Ghibli's highest grossing movie of all time. It also became the first non-English language animated film to win an Academy Award. My Neighbour Totoro became the first Ghibli film to ever debut in theatres in China in 2018, 30 years after its original release. China has a strict quota on the number of foreign films it shows. One analyst told the BBC last year that political tensions between China and Japan in the past could be why some Japanese movies had not been aired in China until very recently. Japan occupied China in 1931 and millions of Chinese people had been killed by the time the war ended in 1945. But for many, feelings of resentment towards Japan lingered. "Right now that relationship has improved significantly and there is a lot of movement on Sino-Japanese co-productions, including in anime," Stanley Rosen from the University of Southern California said. Spirited Away has also already outperformed Totoro which grossed $27.3m for its full run, state media outlet CGTN reports. Studio Ghibli: Japan's answer to Disney
It's the first time a European city has topped the rankings of the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) annual survey. The worldwide league table ranks 140 cities on a range of factors, including political and social stability, crime, education and access to healthcare. In the survey, Manchester saw the biggest improvement of any European city, rising by 16 places to rank 35th. Manchester's rise puts it ahead of London in the rankings by 13 places, the widest gap between the two cities since the survey began two decades ago. The EIU said Manchester's jump in the rankings was due to an improved security score. 'Resilience' The survey was criticised last year for demoting Manchester after the Manchester Arena attack which killed 22 victims. This year, survey editor Roxana Slavcheva said Manchester had "shown resilience in the city's recovery from a recent, high-profile terrorist attack, which previously shook up stability". Ms Slavcheva said security had also improved in "several western European cities" and Vienna's top place in the rankings reflected "a relative return to stability across much of Europe". It was also praised for its lack of petty crime, described as one of the safest cities in Europe. According to the survey, nearly half of the cities have seen their liveability ranking improve over the past year. Melbourne, which was ranked second in this year's global rankings, had previously come top for seven years running. Two other Australian cities also made this year's top ten: Sydney and Adelaide. At the other end of the scale, war-torn Damascus in Syria was ranked the least liveable city, closely followed by Dhaka in Bangladesh and Lagos in Nigeria. The EIU said that crime, civil unrest, terrorism or war played a "strong role" in the ten-lowest scoring cities. The ten most liveable cities in 2018 1. Vienna, Austria 2. Melbourne, Australia 3.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the economy grew by 0.5% in the final three months of 2014. That was a slowdown from 0.7% growth recorded in the previous three months. Economists were mixed over whether the loss of momentum in the final quarter might be temporary or prolonged. The ONS's chief economist, Joe Grice, said it was "too early to say" if this slowdown would persist. "The dominant services sector remains buoyant while the contraction has taken place in industries like construction, mining and energy supply, which can be erratic," he said. But Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said the fourth-quarter figure "hardly set the world alight... and it's clear that [the economy] is slowing". She said: "There are clouds looming large on the horizon, and the general election is the biggest of these. Investors don't like uncertainty." The services sector grew by 0.8% in the quarter, but construction contracted by 1.8%. Manufacturing grew by just 0.1%, its worst performance since the start of 2013. "The main disappointment with growth in the fourth quarter was that it looks unbalanced on the output side of the economy at least," said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight. But Chancellor George Osborne said the figures showed the economy was "on track". He warned that the international economic climate was "getting worse", and so the government must continue with its economic strategy. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the slowdown in fourth-quarter growth was a concern, and that "Tory claims that the economy is fixed will ring hollow with working people" whose "wages are down by £1,600 a year since 2010". 'At odds' The ONS figures are the first estimate of fourth-quarter growth and could be revised up or down as more economic data for the three months is gathered by the statistics office. Economists at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said they "wouldn't be surprised if the ONS figures are revised up over time, painting a stronger picture for economic performance at the end of the year". The construction data which dragged down the fourth-quarter figures were "surprising and at odds with other indicators and surveys" which presented a healthier picture, the CEBR said. Tuesday figures mean the UK was among the best-performing of the all the major economies in 2014. US growth figures are due to be published on Friday, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimating expansion of 2.4% for the year. The IMF forecasts UK growth of 2.7% in 2015. However, Samuel Tombs, of consultancy Capital Economics, has predicted growth of 3%. "With the recent halving of oil prices providing a timely boost to households' discretionary spending power, credit still becoming cheaper and pay growth on an improving trend... the best days of the UK's recovery may still lie ahead," he said. Analysis: Robert Peston, BBC economics editor How significant is the slowdown in the British economy, given that the dominant service sector is still booming, but construction is shrinking and manufacturing almost back to flatlining? The deceleration is not surprising, in view of the flatlining of the UK's main trading partner, the eurozone. And two of the negative influences, a fall in energy supply of 2.8% and in construction of 1.8%, are in industries that tend to be volatile. That said, it does give pause for thought that growth is now apparently being driven to a large extent by retail and consumer spending. We were supposed to be rebalancing, towards manufacturing and investment. And although there has been a bit of that over the past couple of years, it appears to be petering out.

The X Factor star is currently judging auditions for the ITV1 show, and toured with the Black Eyed Peas recently. Her busy schedule is thought to have left her worn out, but her spokesman would not comment on newspaper reports she had fainted during a photoshoot. "Following doctors' advice Cheryl Cole will be cancelling all work commitments for the next week," he said. Marriage split The Sun reported that the 27-year collapsed at a photoshoot for her second solo album on Saturday and was diagnosed with exhaustion and gastroenteritis. But her spokesman said he had "nothing further to say" when asked about the claims. Cole split from her husband, England footballer Ashley Cole, in February and filed for divorce three months later. Since then has been busy touring as a solo act for the first time, supporting Black Eyed Peas, in recent months, and recording her second album. The Girls Aloud star is also scheduled to play high-profile shows at the V Festival in August.
The EU introduced the measure amid a row with vaccine manufacturers over delivery shortfalls. But WHO vice-head Mariangela Simao said it was a "very worrying trend". Earlier WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said "vaccine nationalism" could lead to a "protracted recovery". Speaking at the Davos Agenda - a virtual version of the global summit - he said vaccine hoarding would "keep the pandemic burning and... slow global economic recovery", in addition to being a "catastrophic moral failure" that could further widen global inequality. What is the EU doing? The European Union is introducing export controls on coronavirus vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. The so-called transparency mechanism gives EU countries powers to deny authorisation for vaccine exports if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU. "The protection and safety of our citizens is a priority and the challenges we now face left us with no choice but to act," the European Commission said. The controls will affect some 100 countries worldwide - including the UK, the US, Canada and Australia - but many others, including poorer nations, are exempt. However, the EU has been forced to backtrack on plans to impose restrictions on the export of vaccines across the border on the island of Ireland after outcry from Dublin and London. The EU insists its controls are a temporary scheme, not an export ban. Why is this happening now? The news comes with the EU in a very public dispute with drug-maker AstraZeneca over supplies, and under growing pressure over the slow pace of vaccine distribution. Earlier on Friday the Commission made public a confidential contract with AstraZeneca, the UK-Swedish company behind the Oxford vaccine, to bolster its argument that the firm has been failing to fulfil its promises to deliver to the bloc. The contract stipulates that the pharmaceutical company would commit its "best reasonable efforts" to manufacture and distribute doses. AstraZeneca has blamed the delays on production glitches at plants in the Netherlands and Belgium, as well as the late signing of contracts. Under the EU's new rule, vaccine firms will have to seek permission before supplying doses beyond the EU. Its 27 member states will be able to vet those export applications. Vaccines produced by Pfizer in Belgium are currently being exported to the UK, and the EU insists that some of the AstraZeneca vaccine produced in England is destined under contract for EU citizens. The EU is also in a supply dispute with Pfizer, which is set to fall short of the contracted vaccine volume for the EU by the end of March. Pfizer says the reason for that is the urgent expansion of its facility in Puurs, Belgium. Who is exempt from the export controls? The EU is allowing some 92 exemptions from the export control regime, including: vaccine donations to Covax, the global scheme to help poorer countries; and exports to Switzerland, countries in the western Balkans, Norway and North Africa. Other Mediterranean countries such as Lebanon and Israel are also exempt. But on Saturday WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told the BBC vaccines should be given to all vulnerable groups and health workers across the globe before each country starts giving the jabs out more widely. This would mean wealthy nations, such as the UK, halting immunisations at home once priority groups had been vaccinated and instead helping with vaccinations elsewhere. "We're asking all countries in those circumstances to do that - hang on, wait for those other groups. Rather than rushing to vaccinate one country, we need to be doing the lot and we need to be doing it together," she said. So far 95% of all vaccinations had taken place in just 10 countries, Ms Harris said, while only two low and middle income countries had even begun immunisation programmes. The EU is contracted to receive the following vaccine doses: Pressure grows as nations grow impatient The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says some EU governments are beginning to show impatience with Brussels, which had hoped its vaccination purchasing scheme would be a beacon of European solidarity and strength. The Commission's laboured negotiating process, the tardy approval of vaccines by the EU's medical regulator and delays now in vaccine deliveries have left EU citizens demanding answers and action, our correspondent says. Markus Söder, the Bavarian premier and Germany's possible future chancellor, told ZDF television on Friday that it was his impression that the commission "ordered too late, and only bet on a few companies, they agreed on a price in a typically bureaucratic EU procedure and completely underestimated the fundamental importance of the situation." On Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron questioned the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine, describing it as "quasi-ineffective" for the over-65s. The claim was rejected by Sir John Bell, an Oxford University professor who was part of the team behind the vaccine. "I suspect this is a bit of demand management from Mr Macron," Sir John told BBC Radio Four's Today programme. Asked if he thought Mr Macron was trying to reduce demand for the jab, he added: "Well, if he didn't have any vaccine the best thing you could do is reduce demand." The politics of vaccines in the EU Earlier this week the EU indicated this proposal was coming down the track. It would be a "notification system" officials said. Nothing more than a way of showing transparency. That has now turned into an export control policy, partly because of Germany's insistence that EU governments should be the ones to decide whether EU-based companies can export vaccines elsewhere. EU officials tell me that it's also been partly triggered by the deep suspicion of the "vague justification" given by AstraZeneca this week, when their chief executive insisted that the production problem was down to "lower productivity" at its Belgian plant. This new system of export control could well affect British vaccine deliveries. Pfizer currently dispatches doses from the Puurs site here to the UK. In future, Pfizer would have to fill in an export form and wait up to 48 hours for their export request to be accepted or rejected by the Belgian government. That decision would be based on whether the company could prove that taking that batch of vaccine to the UK would not affect the existing EU agreement.
Experts warn public mistrust of vaccines means the world is taking a step backwards in the fight against preventable infectious diseases, and a study by the World Health Organisation, the biggest global study into people's attitudes on immunisation, shows trust is worryingly low in some regions. The BBC World Service has been looking at the issue across the globe in three days of special coverage. Prof Beate Kampmann, director of the Vaccine Centre at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, answers questions about vaccinations sent in by readers of BBC News, following a Facebook Live question-and-answer session on Wednesday. Diane: How do you inform the misinformed? There is no easy answer. The problem is the misinformed tend to communicate with each other and perpetuate the misinformation. There is a lot of objective vaccine information available from Public Health England, for example, which can be accessed via their website. Vaccine centres - like ours at the London School, or the one at the University of Oxford - will also have spaces for people to look up information which has been put there by scientists. Threlsar: Is there any standard vaccination to prevent tuberculosis? The only vaccine in use is BCG and it works, but not well enough. We are trying very hard to make a better one but it's taking time. Sharena: Is there any vaccine for dengue fever? Yes, but it cannot be given to very young children. Asmah: Is the HPV vaccine only effective for young women who aren't sexually active? Ideally the vaccine should prevent infection with the human papilloma viruses, and that is best done before women - or men- become sexually active. This is the priority of the HPV vaccination program right now. Myrddin: Do children get more jabs in America? You mean in comparison to the UK? No, the same vaccines are recommended as in many other countries. Sometimes the preparations vary but essentially the vaccines work against the same diseases. If you compare with some other, less resourceful countries then, yes, kids in the USA will get more vaccines than kids in, let's say, Liberia. Marjolein: Why does the NHS not recommend vaccination for adults who are unvaccinated unless they are travelling to an area with an outbreak? In the context of the measles outbreak actually it has been recommended that anyone who has not had two doses of the vaccine should get vaccinated, no matter what their age. Yvonne: Why do they insist on mixing all the vaccines together? And how much research has gone into the long term effects of mixing three or four vaccines together? The idea of mixing the vaccines together is to prevent too many injections. Each time vaccines are combined they need to be tested to check they do not interfere with each other and all remains safe and effective. Only then are the combination vaccines licensed. People worry about "overload" but this isn't an issue - just by going out onto the London tube we are exposed to thousands of germs every day. Even if a child was given 10 vaccines at once, it would only use about a thousandth of their immune system. Jean: Why can't we give separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella? Surely that would alleviate some parental concerns and increase uptake of vaccination? It makes no sense as far as the body's immune response is concerned, and it requires multiple injections- not too nice for the kids. There really is no need to split these components - the combination is safe and effective and we need to put this issue to bed. Jack: Why do you think people are so afraid of vaccines? Who could possibly benefit? I think their insights into the serious consequences of diseases have reduced so much because we do not see them anymore in countries where vaccines have been regularly used for a long time. Hence, people only see they might have a sore arm or a bit of a fever but cannot compare that against the experience of the "real" disease. It would be a shame to have to wait until the diseases are back to convince people vaccines actually work and have already saved countless lives. Jim: Do vaccines work as well for older people? As we age so do our immune systems and the memory, not just in the brain! Hence, we sometimes do not respond to vaccines - or infections - in the same way as when we were young. We are doing research to see how we can best optimise the vaccines for the elderly, as they also need protection, and be effective at any stage of life. Kam: Why isn't it a legal requirement for vaccines to be given? It is in some countries but in the UK it is not mandatory as we believe the evidence is so good that people should be persuaded. There might be situations where that has to change but for now it would be good to win the argument through persuasion. Maggy: Why isn't it mandatory for children to be vaccinated before attending any schooling? Not in the UK - it is in the US, Australia, currently in Italy also- it's a bit of a moving field Jaafar: What safety guides do companies follow in making these vaccines? And how do we know that said company is a reliable company? In order to gain licensure, international regulatory authorities such as the FDA (USA) and the EMA (Europe) have to approve the product - this can only happen when the international safety standards are met. Alvin: Does the vaccine wear out? And are the vaccines properly tested? Vaccines have to conform to international safety standards. Their production is monitored and the clinical trials before they can get a license are done to international so-called good clinical practice. Vaccines have a sell-by date for a specific batch that was made in the factory and need to be used before that's come up. Protection can wear out for some vaccines, which is why we often need so called "boosters" to refresh the memory of the immune system and generate more antibodies. How many doses are needed throughout life depends on the type of vaccine.
The bank blamed the negative effect of $2.4bn in fines and settlements and UK customer redress for the sharp fall. The results follow allegations, which emerged earlier this month, that HSBC had helped people evade UK tax using hidden HSBC accounts in Geneva. HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver saw his overall pay for the year fall to £7.6m from £8.03m in 2013. The lower total reflects a smaller bonus of £3.4m for the year, compared to £5.5m in 2013. Mr Gulliver said the lower bonus reflected "failures" linked to foreign exchange manipulation. Chairman Douglas Flint's total pay increased to £2.5m from £2.4m for the year, but he did not receive a bonus. Pressed after the results on whether he should have received a bonus, Mr Gulliver said his bonuses were subject to 100% clawback by the bank for seven years, enabling the bank to demand repayment "if anything turns up later that happened on my watch". Advertising controversy Mr Gulliver was also asked about the bank's policy on placing advertising in newspapers. It follows an allegation made by the former chief political commentator at the Daily Telegraph who said that the newspaper avoided writing negative stories about HSBC, so as not to lose its advertising. Mr Gulliver confirmed that HSBC does withdraw advertising from companies that publish negative editorial content. But he said it was not an effort to influence newspapers' editorial decisions. Mr Gulliver said: "We advertise in order to sell more banking products. We don't put adverts alongside hostile editorial coverage because we won't get any value for spending that advertising dollar." And Mr Gulliver went on to describe the move as "just common sense" for HSBC's marketing team. "There's nothing sinister to it at all. Genuinely, there is nothing beyond a commercial decision as to where we put our advertising." Shares slide HSBC's shares fell more than 5%, hitting their lowest level for two-and-a-half years, after it reported its fall in profit, which was larger than analysts had expected. The drop in profitability was driven by $2.4bn in fines and customer compensation costs, largely connected to fines in connection with traders' attempted manipulation of foreign exchange rates and compensation for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. The bank has been streamlining its business in an attempt to boost earnings, and Mr Gulliver said it had now closed or sold 77 businesses and lost 50,000 jobs since he took the helm in 2011. "For all the recent media furore around potential conduct issues, it is the 'underlying' performance which, we believe, should be the greatest cause of investor concern," said Investec analyst Ian Gordon. Analysis by Kamal Ahmed, BBC business editor In all the coverage of HSBC's Swiss private banking arm and Stuart Gulliver's banking arrangements (channelled through Switzerland and Panama), it is easy to miss the fact that HSBC has more broadly had a torrid year. Its return on equity (the key marker of the return a bank is making on the money it invests) has fallen from 9.2% to 7.3%. Its earnings per share are down. Its operating expenses - the amount it costs to run the bank - are up 6.1%. Fines and "redress" (in the main payments for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance) total £2.4bn. The bank has also raised significant concerns over Europe, saying that reform is "far less risky than going it alone". No wonder HSBC's share price is down 5% this morning. On Monday, HSBC reiterated its recent apology for the conduct of its Swiss private bank, saying the historical practices and behaviour were "unacceptable". The bank said restoration of trust in the industry "remains a significant challenge as further misdeeds are uncovered but it is a challenge we must meet successfully". "When commentators extrapolate instances of control failure or individual misconduct to question the culture of the firm, it strikes painfully at the heart of our identity," it added. Mr Gulliver's Swiss bank account On Sunday, Mr Gulliver himself was dragged into the Swiss tax furore, with HSBC confirming he used a Swiss bank account to hold his bonuses. The bank was responding to a report in the Guardian that Mr Gulliver has £5m in the account which he controls using a Panamanian company. HSBC said he opened the account in 1998 when he was living and working in Hong Kong and full tax was paid in Hong Kong on the bonus payments. On Monday, Mr Gulliver said he had never paid below the highest rate of UK tax on all his earnings since becoming chief executive. "I'm UK tax resident, Hong Kong domiciled. I've paid full UK tax on the entirety of my worldwide earnings. It's not surprising as a 35-year HSBC veteran that I should be Hong Kong domiciled. I would expect to die abroad, which is a test of domicility," he added. He said HSBC's computer system in the 1990s let everyone in the bank access the bank accounts of every other member of staff. As a result, he opened a bank account in Switzerland to hide his compensation from prying colleagues. He said he then used a Panamanian company to ensure HSBC staff in Switzerland also could not access his account. "Really it was to enable me to have confidentiality in my own firm. There was no tax advantage," Mr Gulliver said. Investigations The Financial Conduct Authority, HMRC, Swiss prosecutors and MPs on the Treasury Committee are looking into the allegations that HSBC helped people evade UK tax using hidden HSBC accounts in Geneva. The former director of public prosecutions, Lord Ken Macdonald, has warned that HSBC has left itself open to criminal charges in the UK over the tax-dodging scandal. The QC said there were strong grounds to investigate the bank for "cheating" HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
If confirmed by the US Senate, Ms Yellen, 67, would replace Ben Bernanke, who has held the post for eight years. She has been his deputy for the last two years, and would become the first woman to head the Federal Reserve. Ms Yellen and Mr Bernanke are due to appear with the president on Wednesday. She has taught at Harvard University and the London School of Economics, as well as holding a series of senior administrative positions in the US. 'Depth of experience' Ms Yellen, like Mr Bernanke, is seen as a "dove", meaning she prefers to prioritise boosting employment by keeping rates low rather than worrying about inflation. Her nomination has been widely expected since former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers withdrew his candidature last month amid opposition from liberal Democrats. As Democrats control the 100-seat Senate, Ms Yellen's appointment would only need six Republican votes to overcome potential any procedural hurdles. Some conservatives are scrutinising her views on monetary policy and her support for previous federal stimulus efforts. On Wednesday, the second-most powerful Republican in the Senate questioned whether she was the right choice. "Ms Yellen subscribes to the liberal school of thought that the best way to handle our nation's fiscal challenges is to throw more money at them," John Cornyn of Texas, the party's whip in the Senate, said in a statement. "This stimulus obsession is the reason the nation finds itself in the fiscal calamity it does today, and the last thing we need is a leader at the helm of the Federal Reserve who is intent on more quantitative easing that harms our economy." Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican on the banking committee, said in a statement: "I voted against Vice-Chairman Yellen's original nomination to the Fed in 2010 because of her dovish views on monetary policy." "We will closely examine her record since that time, but I am not aware of anything that demonstrates her views have changed." 'Battle tested' But Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said Ms Yellen would win Senate confirmation "by a wide margin". The chairman of the US Senate banking committee, Tim Johnson, said she had "a depth of experience that is second to none". "I have no doubt she will be an excellent Federal Reserve chairman," he added. The BBC's chief business correspondent, Linda Yueh, says the transition from Mr Bernanke to Ms Yellen is likely to be "seamless" and will not have much impact, because the two already work so closely together. "I don't think there's going to be a radical change," she said on Radio 4's Today programme, adding that the changeover was unlikely to alter the timing of the Fed's withdrawal of economic stimulus. Ms Yellen's most recent academic post was at the University of California, Berkeley. A former colleague there, Laura Tyson, professor of business and economics, told the BBC Ms Yellen's nomination was "terrific news". "We have an outstanding candidate who is a wonderful match of skills and experience and temperament and reputation around the world at a time when monetary policy is extremely important," she said. "Continuity is important and Janet is an outstanding candidate." A former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve, Prof Randy Kroszner, told the BBC that Ms Yellen was "battle tested" and would be driven by the data in deciding when to reduce support to the markets.
By Esther WebberBBC News It's been billed as the most important piece of televised political theatre in Scotland's history. For two hours between 20:00 BST and 22:00 BST, the figureheads of the "Yes" and "No" campaigns will participate in a head-to-head showdown in a bid to win over hearts and minds before the referendum on 18 September, when voters will be asked the yes/no question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" There's already been drama over the line-up. Mr Salmond repeatedly called for UK Prime Minister David Cameron to face him in the debate, calling him "feart" when he rejected the invitation. Mr Cameron said as leader of the pro-UK campaign, Mr Darling was the man for the job. Then there was a wrangling over the date. Now there's the much-anticipated spectacle of a live debate. A silver-tongued swipe at the opposition can gain admiration. An ill-timed stumble or an embarrassing gaffe can send a campaign into an tailspin. Both protagonists have experience in the field. The leader of the SNP faced other Scottish party leaders in a debate before the Holyrood elections in 2011 and Mr Darling has been a familiar face on the small screen as a former Scotland Secretary and Chancellor of the Exchequer. But how much do televised debates matter? Tom Mludzinski, head of political polling at ComRes - which organised the responsive "worm" that tracked audience reactions to the leaders' debates before the general election in 2010 - says the one thing TV debates guarantee is a wider audience - "viewers who wouldn't normally watch political programmes". "It can be a particular help where things are unknown - that's what we saw with Nick Clegg [ahead of the 2010 British general election]. He had a much lower profile back then, and that exposure created the 'I agree with Nick' phenomenon and so-called Clegg-mania," he says. Following that logic, Mr Mludzinski argues that "there is more to gain for Darling, who's perhaps less well-known as an orator and has the chance to make a good impression". However, Scott Macnab, a political correspondent for the Scotsman, says the SNP leader will also be hoping to gain some ground. "The polls are against Alex Salmond. He's the one who really has to make it happen. If Mr Darling and Mr Salmond came out level-pegging, I suspect the Better Together people would be pretty happy with that. For Alistair Darling, it's a case of damage limitation," he says. There is also more of a risk of Mr Salmond's personality eclipsing the campaign on the "Yes" side, he argues, since the first minister is "a love-hate figure". "He will have to show that independence will be better for the people of Scotland - in terms of the economy, healthcare et cetera - in order to avoid it being a referendum on Alex Salmond," he says. But if either man turns out to be a smash hit with viewers, would it make people more likely to vote for their cause? And would a gaffe have the opposite impact? Mr Clegg's rating jumped from just under 20% to fluctuating between 28% and 33% after the three televised leader debates before the British general election, but his TV appearance didn't translate into as many votes as he might have hoped - the Lib Dems went from 62 seats to 57. But the public response to his performance was "useful all the same", Mr Mludzinski says, "since it helped give him the credibility he needed going into the negotiations that led to the coalition being formed". Some televised debates across the Atlantic in the US - where they are more widespread - have had more impact. Texas governor Rick Perry was a much-fancied contender in the 2011 race for the Republican nomination before he decided to list the three government departments he would axe if he made it to the White House in a TV debate. The trouble was, he could only remember two of them. He withdrew from the race shortly afterwards. And in the first US presidential TV debate in 1960, Republican nominee Richard Nixon famously lost out on the presidency after many thought he appeared sweaty and shifty next to a polished and confident John F Kennedy. However, Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor of communication at the University of Pennsylvania, says in general, TV debates in the US "don't have a great deal of impact on the way people vote". "Where it does make a difference is for the minority of voters who've not made up their minds or who don't have strong partisan ties - and also where the race is very close," she says. In the case of the referendum, Mr Macnab thinks it will be difficult for either side to produce a trump card to woo the undecided since "everything's already out there" - something that those that feel there are still many unanswered questions would challenge. But if debates only make a difference in a small number of cases, why do broadcasters and politicians hold them? In addition to trying to reach and inform more voters, they also help make politicians more accessible and give an insight into how they might deal with different policies, Prof Jamieson argues. "While they might not make people switch sides, we know debates help people learn how candidates would govern and how they would handle certain issues - they're very useful in tying campaigns to governance," he says. So would Scots like to see their politicians on TV more often? Mr Macnab is sceptical. "It's been a very long campaign and most people are getting a little weary of it. Watching the Commonwealth Games has been a welcome break," he says. The debate's viewing figures might be the best indicator of how many people are engaged - or have already switched off. The debate will be shown on STV on Tuesday 5 August at 20:00 BST.
The law, making it a crime to undermine Beijing's authority, prompted fears Hong Kong's unique status could end. China said it reserved the right to take "counter-measures" against the UK. There are 2.9m people in Hong Kong eligible for the passport. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the UK and China had agreed that holders of British National (Overseas) - or BNO - passports should not enjoy UK residency. "All such BNO passport holders are Chinese nationals and if the UK insists on changing this practice it will not only violate its own stance but also international law," he added. There are 300,000 BNO passport holders in Hong Kong who already have the right to visit the UK for up to six months without a visa. But the Home Office confirmed that the proposed new rights, allowing those eligible to spend 12 months in the UK without a visa, could be offered to anyone with BNO status as long as they applied for and were granted the passport - opening it up to 2.9m Hong Kong residents. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was "deeply concerned" at China's proposals for legislation related to national security in Hong Kong. In a statement, she said: "If China imposes this law, we will explore options to allow British Nationals Overseas to apply for leave to stay in the UK, including a path to citizenship. "We will continue to defend the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong." Mr Raab's statement came after the UK, US, Australia and Canada issued joint condemnation of Beijing's plan, saying imposing the security law would undermine the "one country, two systems" framework agreed before Hong Kong was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997. The framework guaranteed Hong Kong some autonomy and afforded rights and freedoms that do not exist in mainland China. It comes as US President Donald Trump described the Chinese government's plans in Hong Kong as a "tragedy", and announced he would start to end preferential US treatment for the city in trade and travel. China has rejected foreign criticism of the proposed law, which could be in force as early as the end of June. Li Zhanshu, chairman of the parliamentary committee that will now draft the law, said it was "in line with the fundamental interests of all Chinese people, including Hong Kong compatriots". What did Raab say? British National (Overseas) passports were issued to people in Hong Kong by the UK before the transfer of the territory to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. Announcing the possible change in policy, Mr Raab said the six-month limit on stays in the UK for BNO holders would be scrapped. "If China continues down this path and implements this national security legislation, we will remove that six month limit and allow those BNO passport holders to come to the UK and to apply to work and study for extendable periods of 12 months and that will itself provide a pathway to future citizenship," he said. The BBC's diplomatic correspondent James Landale says that Beijing might not mind if some pro-democracy campaigners escape to the UK, but the flight of talented wealth creators would be of concern. Some MPs want the UK to go further and offer automatic citizenship. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said BNO holders should have an automatic right to live and work in the UK. The government has in the past rejected calls to give BNO holders in Hong Kong full citizenship. Last year more than 100,000 people in Hong Kong signed a petition calling for full rights. The government responded by saying that only UK citizens and certain Commonwealth citizens had the right of abode in the UK and cited a 2007 review which said giving BNO holders full citizenship would be a breach of the agreement under which the UK handed Hong Kong back to China. However in 1972 the UK offered asylum to some 30,000 Ugandan Asians with British Overseas passports after the then-military ruler Idi Amin ordered about 60,000 Asians to leave. At the time some MPs said India should take responsibility for the refugees, but Prime Minister Edward Heath said the UK had a duty to accept them. What other reaction has there been? Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy earlier said the UK had to be more robust with Beijing. Referring to the security law, she told the BBC: "This is the latest in a series of attempts by China to start to erode the joint declaration which Britain co-signed with the Chinese government when we handed over Hong Kong, and protected its special status." "We want to see the UK government really step up now," she said. Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK should bring together a coalition of countries to avoid a tragedy in the territory. He told the BBC: "This is definitely the most dangerous period there has ever been in terms of that agreement. "With our unique legal situation, Britain does have a responsibility now to pull together that international coalition and to do what we can to protect the people of Hong Kong." On Thursday Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: "We are deeply concerned about China's legislation related to national security in Hong Kong. "We have been very clear that the security legislation risks undermining the principle of one country, two systems. "We are in close contact with our international partners on this and the Foreign Secretary spoke to US Secretary [Mike] Pompeo last night." He added: "The steps taken by the Chinese government place the Joint Declaration under direct threat and do undermine Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy." On Wednesday, Mr Pompeo said developments in Hong Kong meant it could no longer be considered to have "a high degree of autonomy" from mainland China. This could lead to Hong Kong being treated the same as mainland China under US law, which would have major implications for its trade hub status.
Researchers at King's College London, in collaboration with the University of Suffolk, tested 15 different locations across Suffolk. Their report said cocaine was found in all samples tested. Other illicit drugs, such as ketamine, were also widespread in the shrimp. The researchers said it was a "surprising" finding. Professor Nic Bury, from the University of Suffolk, said: "Whether the presence of cocaine in aquatic animals is an issue for Suffolk, or more widespread an occurrence in the UK and abroad, awaits further research. "Environmental health has attracted much attention from the public due to challenges associated with climate change and microplastic pollution. "However, the impact of 'invisible' chemical pollution (such as drugs) on wildlife health needs more focus in the UK." The study, published in Environment International, looked at the exposure of wildlife, such as the freshwater shrimp Gammarus pulex, to different micropollutants. Researchers collected the samples from the rivers Alde, Box, Deben, Gipping and Waveney. They said in addition to the drugs, banned pesticides and pharmaceuticals were also widespread in the shrimp that were collected. The potential for any effect on the creatures was "likely to be low", they said. Dr Leon Barron, from King's College London, said: "Such regular occurrence of illicit drugs in wildlife was surprising. "We might expect to see these in urban areas such as London, but not in smaller and more rural catchments. "The presence of pesticides which have long been banned in the UK also poses a particular challenge as the sources of these remain unclear."
By Claire MarshallBBC environment correspondent According to the latest data from insurer NFU Mutual, the cost of crime to the UK's rural economy reached £44.5m in 2013. This is up 5.2% on 2012 figures, reversing the fall of the previous year. And 2013 was also the worst year on record for livestock theft. NFU Mutual says it insures three quarters of farmers in the UK. It compiles an annual rural crime report based on claims data and on a survey of the company's 300 local offices. This year's report says that a wave of sheep and cattle rustling in Northern Ireland and northern parts of England drove livestock theft costs costs up by 25%. Much larger numbers of sheep were being taken in each raid: up to 150 sheep at a time, rather than just a dozen. The fear is that they enter the food chain, making it impossible to track those responsible. Expensive machines Thieves also targeted high-value agricultural equipment, the report says. While the number of vehicles stolen actually fell, the value of insurance claims rose. This is because farm machinery is becoming much more high-tech and expensive to buy, the company said. "There is no doubt that both opportunist criminals and members of international criminals are targeting farms," said Tim Price, rural affairs specialist with NFU Mutual. "While the first group will often move on to an easier target if they see a farm that has even basic security in place, the latter are professionally organised with a specific target." Many stolen top-of-the-range vehicles are smuggled out of the country, ending up in eastern Europe, the company said. The county worst affected by this type of crime was Cambridgeshire, where claims totalled £2.7m. A new trend is also emerging of criminals seeking out older models that are not fitted with immobilisers and alarms. Much of this stolen property is then sold to developing nations. The most common items targeted over the past 12 months were tools, followed by all-terrain vehicles and quad bikes, and then oil and diesel. Pilfering pesticides Criminals have also started focusing on pesticides from farm chemical stores. In one reported case, sprays worth £20,000 were stolen in a single raid. The advice is to take more precautions. But this can sometimes have negative consequences. "The problem is that the more secure you make it, the more obvious it is that you've got something to hide," Stephen Hole, a farmer in Somerset, told BBC News. Recently, he had plastic sheeting valued at several thousand pounds, and which is used to wrap bales, stolen. "As long as the insurance keep paying out, we don't have to worry about it too much. £100, £200 excess? That's nothing." Liz Scott, who runs a nearby farm, had £2,000 of the same wrapping stolen. She is now planning to install extra locks and a security camera. "It's horrible. It feels like you're going to be like Fort Knox." Follow Claire on Twitter @BBCMarshall
By Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent He had just been told that a Chinese woman was landing at Vancouver airport in a few hours and that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had an arrest warrant out for her based on a US request. What the research revealed was that she was the chief financial officer of the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei and the daughter of the company's founder. It was at that moment that border officials realised they were about to be plunged into the centre of a major international incident which, nearly two years on, has not gone away. The woman was Meng Wanzhou whose flight from Hong Kong arrived at Gate 65 at 11:10 local time. She was on a stopover in Canada, where she has two homes, before heading on to business meetings in Mexico. Further details of what took place at the airport have been revealed in a Vancouver court in the past week as part of the latest stage of legal battle that could stretch on for years. Her lawyers are pursuing a multi-pronged strategy to prevent her being extradited to the US on charges of misleading the bank HSBC in a way which might lead to it breaking US sanctions on Iran. Ms Meng's lawyers have been arguing that there was abuse of process in the way the arrest was carried out. One of the issues they raised is why Meng was questioned for nearly three hours by officers from Canadian Border Services Agency before she was formally arrested by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP). Her lawyers are looking for signs that proper procedures were not followed in what unfolded in those hours. Ms Meng, who appeared in court wearing the security ankle bracelet that is required for her bail, was described as "calm" during her initial questioning at the airport because she had no idea what was coming next. Border officials took her phones and devices and placed them in a special bag - designed to prevent any electronic interference. Border officials also got her passwords and PIN codes for the devices but the court heard that they mistakenly handed these, along with the devices, over to the RCMP when they technically should not have done. It was just after 14:00 when this questioning was over that she was met by a police officer who explained to Ms Meng that she was being arrested and was entitled to a lawyer. The police officer who eventually arrested her after the border questioning was challenged in court as to why he did not do so earlier. Her lawyers are looking for evidence a co-ordinated plan by border agency and police - perhaps with the guiding hand of the US behind them - to improperly detain and question her without a lawyer. Officials deny this and say the border questioning was to establish whether there was any reason she could not be admitted, for instance involvement in espionage. The police officer also testified "safety" concerns were one reason he did not arrest Ms Meng immediately after her Cathay Pacific 777 flight landed. This part of the legal battle will focus on whether procedures were followed and if not, whether that was due to simple mistakes or the result of any plan. The arrest has caused a serious diplomatic crisis between Canada and China, with allegations that two Canadians have been arrested in China on national security charges as a bargaining chip over Ms Meng's detention. The legal battle over her extradition is likely to go on for months and perhaps years with appeals on different issues leaving relations between the two countries in a difficult state and Ms Meng still in Canada.
Meals must include one or more portions of vegetables or salad every day and no more than two portions of fried foods or pastry-based foods each week. The rules promote drinking water and limit fruit juice servings to 150ml. The new regulations are mandatory for local authority schools, new free schools and schools that convert to academy status. They stipulate: Details of the new school food plan were unveiled by ministers in June, following a review of school meals by founders of the Leon food chain John Vincent and Henry Dimbleby. In July 2012, the then-Education Secretary, Michael Gove, asked the restaurateurs to examine nutrition in England's schools and see how it could be improved. The new regulations are in response to those findings and replace ones introduced in the wake of a campaign by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver to improve the standard of food in schools. Mr Oliver led a successful campaign to ban junk and processed food from school canteens and tight nutritional guidelines were brought in. However, he expressed frustration at the time that academy schools were exempt from these rules. Academy exemption Under the new school food plan, academies established before 2010 or after June 2014 are obliged to follow the standards set out. But those founded between 2010 and June 2014 remain exempt. The Department for Education said these schools were being encouraged to sign up to the plan voluntarily and hundreds had already done so. The department said the previous rules had done "much to improve school food" but "were complicated and expensive to enforce". The revised regulations were intended to give school cooks more "flexibility", it said. Dr Patricia Mucavele, head of nutrition at the Children's Food Trust, welcomed the new standards, saying variety was key. "We tested the new standards with the people who would be using them - school caterers and cooks," she said. "They told us the new standards were easier and more intuitive to use to plan interesting and creative menus, which has got to be great news for children and school food."
The euro fell across the board after Greece rejected the conditions of a bailout package, increasing the odds of the country's exit from the eurozone. It was at $1.1014 against the dollar in Asian trade, having recovered slightly from one-month lows hit earlier. Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed down 3.2% at 25,236.28 - leading Asia's losses. Japan's Nikkei 225 ended 2.1% lower at 20,112.12. The yen - often viewed as a haven currency in times of uncertainty - rallied against the dollar and euro. The euro fell 1.5% to a six-week low of 133.70 yen, but then recovered some losses to trade at 135.45. However, it is still down from Friday's rate of 136.185 yen. Major commodities such as oil were also down, with the price of Brent crude falling more than 1% to $59.56 a barrel in Asian trade. Officials step in Japan's government and the Bank of Japan met to discuss the market impact from Greece's "no" vote. "The direct economic and financial relations between Japan and Greece are limited. But government and BOJ (Bank of Japan) officials have held discussions" to ensure Japan responds smoothly to any market response as needed, said Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda. In South Korea, the benchmark Kospi index closed down 2.4% at 2,053.93 - posting its biggest daily loss in three years. Meanwhile, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 index finished 1.1% lower at 5,475. Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP Capital Investors said that while the Greek "no" vote meant more uncertainty ahead for the eurozone, the impact on the markets would be short-lived. "The threat of a flow on to other eurozone countries is likely to keep markets on edge in the short term," he said in a note. "However, contagion is likely to be limited as the rest of Europe is now in far stronger shape than was the case in the 2010-12 eurozone crisis and defence mechanisms against contagion are now stronger." Volatile China trade Mainland Chinese shares surged nearly 8% in morning trade after the government announced measures over the weekend to stabilise the tumbling stock markets. In an unprecedented move, brokerages and fund managers vowed to buy massive amounts of stocks backed by the state. However, the market lost much of the morning's gains, with the Shanghai Composite closing up 2.4% at 3,775.91. On Monday, three Chinese asset managers said they would commit a combined 210m yuan ($33.85m: £21m) of their own money to buy equity funds, as part of a concerted effort by institutional investors to stabilise the market. Harvest Fund Management said it would spend 50m yuan, Yinhua Fund Management would spend 90m yuan, and the asset management arm of Orient Securities would commit 70m yuan to buy equities. Over the weekend, the China Mutual Fund Association said 25 fund firms pledged to buy shares, while another 69 fund firms said they would do the same, as part of emergency measures to boost investor confidence. The Shanghai Composite has fallen nearly 30% over the past three weeks, despite an interest rate cut by the central bank the week earlier and other measures to support the market.
The controversial broadcaster will appear as the guest host of Have I Got News for You on 24 April. "Jeremy's contract has not been renewed on Top Gear but he isn't banned from appearing on the BBC," a BBC spokesman said. Clarkson has hosted the satirical news quiz on numerous occasions. During one appearance in 2008, he threw a pen at regular panellist Ian Hislop that left the latter with a cut on his face. Clarkson was suspended by the BBC on 10 March following a "fracas" with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon in a hotel in North Yorkshire. Mr Tymon suffered swelling and a split lip in the assault on 4 March and visited a hospital A&E department for his injuries. Following an internal investigation, the BBC announced on 25 March Clarkson's contract on Top Gear would not be renewed. More than a million fans signed a petition to reinstate the presenter, but BBC director general Tony Hall said "a line has been crossed" and "there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another". On Tuesday, North Yorkshire Police said there was "no need for further action" against Clarkson following an inquiry into the "fracas". Top Gear is watched by some 350 million viewers worldwide and is one of the BBC's biggest properties - with overseas sales worth an estimated £50m a year. The BBC has said the show will continue without Clarkson, however it is unclear whether co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond will remain.
The Saudi Arabia Stock Exchange fell 5.4% on Sunday, while the Qatar Exchange closed down 7% and Dubai's stocks dropped 4.6%. Those exchanges are dominated by energy firms who fear oil will fall further from its current 12-year low of $29 when Iran resumes oil exports. Iran has said it will sell up to 500,000 extra barrels of crude oil. Economic sanctions, in place for nearly 40 years, were lifted after inspectors confirmed on Saturday that Iran had taken the required steps to limit its nuclear programme. What Iran deal means for world markets Iran sanctions deal in 60 seconds Will Tehran now get a McDonald's? Investors reacted immediately in the first day of trading in the Muslim week. The Saudi Tadawul All Share Index, the largest market in the region, dropped during trading to its lowest level since early 2011, closing at 5,520 points. Share prices in all six of the other Gulf stock exchanges also dropped, as investors weighed up a stronger Iranian economy and extra oil in an already over-supplied market. Saudi Arabia's oil minister Ali al-Naimi said it would take "some time" to restore stability to the global oil market, but added that he remained optimistic. Analysis: Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent It's a bit surprising that markets are surprised - Iran has promised since the Vienna agreement was signed in July to pump 500,000 additional barrels of crude per day when sanctions were lifted. Most oil traders have accelerated their sell-off of oil, gas and energy companies in the run up to Saturday's well flagged announcement by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency). And yet there's been a rout on Gulf stock markets today (Sunday is a full trading day in the Middle East). In fact, the Tadawul All Share Index in Riyadh has halved since the summer of 2014 when oil prices started their precipitous fall from $115 to $29 per barrel. Although Gulf nations are petroleum-based economies, listed companies in most sectors were down - apart from Iran of course. That's because Iran is now expected to be the main beneficiary of billions of dollars of new investment from the West - money which might have previously been spent in other Gulf nations. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday that the deal was "a turning point" for Iran's economy. The lifting of sanctions also enables Iran to use the global financial system for trade. Estimates say close to $100bn (£70bn) of Iranian assets will be unlocked under the nuclear deal.
Civilians bore the brunt of the violence, with more than 2,000 killed in reported jihadist incidents during November 2014. Islamic State carried out the most attacks, adding to the spiralling death toll in Iraq and Syria. Explore the map to find out more. Four countries suffer 80% of losses The data gathered by the BBC found that 5,042 people were killed in 664 jihadist attacks across 14 countries - a daily average of 168 deaths, or seven every hour. About 80% of the deaths came in just four countries - Iraq, Nigeria, Syria and Afghanistan, according to the study of media and civil society reports. Iraq was the most dangerous place to be, with 1,770 deaths in 233 attacks, ranging from shootings to suicide bombings. In Nigeria, 786 people, almost all of them civilians, were killed in 27 Boko Haram incidents. These tended to be large and indiscriminate bombings and shootings such as the attack on the central mosque in the northern city of Kano, which left 120 dead. Boko Haram also struck over the border in Cameroon, killing 15 people. Meanwhile, in East Africa, al-Shabab took 266 lives in Somalia and Kenya. Afghanistan suffered almost the same number of deaths as Nigeria (782) but they tended to be in smaller, targeted attacks, such as the shooting of the deputy governor of Kandahar. In war-ravaged Syria, 693 people were killed; Yemen had 410 deaths in 37 attacks. Of the 16 jihadist groups involved in the bloodshed, Islamic State was the most deadly, killing 2,206 people across Iraq and Syria - 44% of the total death toll. The director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, Prof Peter Neumann, said Islamic State "has rivalled - if not replaced - al-Qaeda as the leader of global jihadism". Read Prof Neumann's full analysis. Civilians the main victims Civilians bore the brunt of the attacks with a total of 2,079 killed, followed by 1,723 military personnel. But the proportions varied significantly between countries. In Nigeria, almost 700 civilians were killed, at least 57 of them children, whereas just 28 deaths were from the military. In contrast, in Syria and Afghanistan, more than twice as many military personnel died as civilians. Of the 146 police officers who died, 95 were in Afghanistan. Politicians and other officials were also targets in Afghanistan, and in Somalia, where 22 were killed. Jihadists themselves were also killed in large numbers: 935 died in clashes or by blowing themselves up. Bombs and bullets kill most Taken together, bombs accounted for the most deaths, with 1,653 people killed in 241 explosions. These included 38 suicide blasts, which took 650 lives and 128 other bombs, such as improvised explosive devices (IEDs), which killed 555. Some explosions were large and aimed at the public while others were highly targeted, such as the man who got inside a police headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan, before blowing himself up. Read Richard Galpin's account: Anatomy of a suicide Gun attacks took at least another 1,574 lives, while a further 666 deaths were described as ambushes, many of which are likely to have involved shootings. It is estimated that 426 people were murdered in execution-style killings, including 50 who were reported to have been beheaded in Syria, Yemen and Libya. Among these were captured US aid worker Peter Kassig, who was beheaded along with a group of Syrians in the middle of the month. Mortars and shelling killed 204 people and 49 were attacked with knives. Prof Neumann said the range of tactics and methods of attack reflected "the increased emphasis on holding territory and confronting conventional forces".

The accident in Pennsylvania left the driver and his passenger injured. The carmaker said that there was "no evidence" that Autopilot was responsible. It follows an investigation into a fatal accident in Florida where the focus is on the apparent failure of Tesla's technology. In the incident in Pennsylvania, the Model X car hit a guard rail and veered into the eastbound lane, ending up on its roof. In a statement, Tesla said: "Based on the information we have now, we have no reason to believe that Autopilot had anything to do with this accident." It said that it had received an automated alert from the car indicating airbags had been deployed but never received logs containing details about the state of vehicle controls, which would indicate whether Autopilot was on or off. Autopilot is a feature which allows cars to automatically change lanes and react to traffic. US car safety regulators are scrutinising the Pennsylvania crash to determine whether the Autopilot system was in use at the time. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a report last week following the death of 40-year-old Joshua Brown, who was killed while driving a Tesla in Florida. It concluded that both the driver and the Autopilot system failed to detect a large tractor-trailer turning left in front of him. In response to that, Tesla reiterated the safety record for its vehicles and the fact that the Autopilot feature is an auto-assist rather than autonomous feature - which means the driver needs to keep both hands on the wheel at all times. The NHTSA is due to issue guidelines around the rules for autonomous car technology later this month. Previously NHTSA chief Mark Rosekind has said that technology such as Autopilot needed to be twice as safe as the manual systems they replace.
It will cut 1,700 jobs in the UK, along with thousands more in Germany, Spain and elsewhere. The move is subject to talks with unions which have opposed compulsory redundancies. The Unite union said the Airbus announcement was "another act of industrial vandalism" against the UK aerospace sector. Some 134,000 people work for Airbus worldwide, with around a tenth of them in the UK. The firm said the UK cuts would fall only on the commercial aircraft division at its two sites at Broughton in Flintshire and Filton, Bristol. More details of the job losses and how they will break down between the two giant factories will come at the end of the week after talks with unions. However, Unite said it expected 1,116 manufacturing jobs and 611 office-based jobs to go, shrinking Airbus's UK workforce by 15%. These cuts were inevitable. The only question was just how severe the pain would be. The Covid-19 pandemic has been little short of catastrophic for the airline industry. At one point in April, global air traffic was down by more than 90%. When planes aren't flying, they aren't earning money. Yet they still need to be maintained and leasing costs or loans still need to be paid. The result? Airlines are struggling to survive and simply can't afford to take on new planes right now. And that, of course, means Airbus has had to curb production. Airbus has delayed these cuts and has made full use of support from governments. But ultimately it had little choice. And the pain being felt in places such as Broughton, Toulouse and Hamburg will echo through the entire supply chain. The firm expects to make the cuts by summer 2021, but hopes the majority of redundancies will be voluntary or through early retirement of staff. The company warned in April that it was "bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed" as it struggled with the impact of the coronavirus crisis. 'Gravest crisis' It said on Tuesday that production had dropped by 40% in recent months, and that it did not expect air traffic to get back to pre-pandemic levels until 2023 at the earliest. "Airbus is facing the gravest crisis this industry has ever experienced," said chief executive Guillaume Faury. "The measures we have taken so far have enabled us to absorb the initial shock of this global pandemic. "Now, we must ensure that we can sustain our enterprise and emerge from the crisis as a healthy, global aerospace leader, adjusting to the overwhelming challenges of our customers." News of the cuts comes as the international aviation industry reels from the impact of the pandemic. On Tuesday, EasyJet said it would close three UK bases and cut about 2,000 staff. And Reuters reported that Air France/KLM was targeting more than 6,500 job cuts over the next two years. Jim McMahon, Labour's shadow transport secretary, called for more government support in the UK. "Labour has consistently called for an extension to the furlough in the most impacted industries, and a sectoral deal that supports the whole aviation industry including securing jobs and protecting the supply chain, while continuing to press for higher environmental standards." A government spokesman said: "We understand this will be a difficult time for Airbus's employees and their families, and we stand ready to support anyone affected in any way we can. "We will continue to work closely with the sector to ensure firms are able to rebuild as the civil aviation market recovers."
Colorado became the first US state to legalise the commercial sale of cannabis in 2012, and stores opened for business on 1 January 2014. In total, 59 marijuana firms filed tax returns on an estimated $14m in sales. Overall, the state collected a total of $3.5m in marijuana taxes if medical marijuana firms are included. Marijuana model? The money is earmarked for youth prevention services, substance abuse treatment, and public health, according to a plan proposed by Colorado Governor, John Hickenlooper. Many other US states are closely watching Colorado's figures. Washington state is set to introduce legal sales later this year. Most of Colorado's tax revenues came from firms around the city of Denver. Recently, US President Barack Obama said marijuana was no more dangerous than alcohol, while cautioning both were bad decisions. Nonetheless, he has instructed the Department of Justice to halt prosecutions of banks that do business with cannabis firms. Currently, 20 US states, as well as Washington, DC, allow for the sale of medical marijuana.
Sigmar Gabriel said the EU would go "down the drain" if other states followed Britain's lead and that the UK could not keep the "nice things" about Europe while taking no responsibility. It comes as Theresa May summoned ministers for a meeting on Wednesday to discuss ideas for the UK's withdrawal. Downing Street said Brexit was "top" of the prime minister's agenda. But a report in The Sunday Times suggested her cabinet was split over leaving the single market. The UK voted to leave the European Union in a referendum vote on 23 June. Mr Gabriel, who is also economy minister in Germany's governing coalition and Chancellor Angela Merkel's deputy, told a news conference that as a result, the world now regarded Europe as an unstable continent. 'Deep trouble' "Brexit is bad but it won't hurt us as much economically as some fear - it's more of a psychological problem and it's a huge problem politically," he said. "If we organise Brexit in the wrong way, then we'll be in deep trouble, so now we need to make sure that we don't allow Britain to keep the nice things, so to speak, related to Europe while taking no responsibility." Mrs Merkel has met a number of European leaders during the past week to prepare the ground for a September summit focused on the EU's future post-Brexit. She has said remaining member states must listen to each other carefully and avoid rushing into policy decisions. Meanwhile, Mrs May is due to begin drawing up blueprints for Brexit on Wednesday, when she hosts cabinet ministers at Chequers, the prime minister's country retreat in Buckinghamshire. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said Mrs May would hear different answers to the question "what does Brexit actually mean?" from around the cabinet table and in Parliament. Trade talks It comes as a new cross-party group called Open Britain was launched. In a joint article for the group in the Sunday Times, three former ministers from the Conservatives, Labour and the Liberal Democrats accept that the free movement of people cannot continue, but they warn against "pulling up the drawbridge." Mr Gabriel also said on Sunday that trade talks between the EU and the US had "de facto failed". The plan - known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP - aimed to remove or reduce a wide range of barriers to EU-US trade and investment. However, the move has been controversial in many of countries involved, including Germany and the UK. Critics say TTIP is driven by big business and would be bad for jobs, consumers and the environment. In 14 rounds of talks, the two sides had not agreed on a single common chapter out of 27 being discussed, Mr Gabriel said. "In my opinion the negotiations with the United States have de facto failed, even though nobody is really admitting it," said Mr Gabriel. 'Don't submit' He suggested Washington was angry about a deal the EU struck with Canada, because it contained elements the US does not want to see in the TTIP. "We mustn't submit to the American proposals," said Mr Gabriel, who is head of Germany's centre-left Social Democratic Party, which is in coalition with Mrs Merkel's centre-right Christian Democratic Union. The BBC's Andrew Walker said ending the negotiations would not be a decision for Mr Gabriel, as he is the leader of centre-left Social Democratic Party, which is in coalition with Mrs Merkel's centre-right Christian Democratic Union. Nonetheless, Mr Gabriel is an important voice and his view that TTIP has in effect failed is a sign of just how much political difficulty it faces, our correspondent added. He has also been forced to defend his actions after he flicked the middle finger to a group of right-wing protesters earlier this month. Sigmar Gabriel said his only mistake was not using both hands, and told his critics to think about what they would do if faced with 12 "young, aggressive, swearing and ready-for-violence Nazis". Mr Gabriel had been confronted by the hecklers in northern Germany.
Ministers confirmed they would bring forward a bill on the issue, indicating the earliest ceremonies could take place by the start of 2015. Political leaders, equality organisations and some faith groups welcomed introducing same-sex marriage. But it was strongly opposed by the Catholic Church and Church of Scotland. The announcement was made in the wake of a government consultation which produced a record 77,508 responses. Same-sex couples in Scotland currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships and the Holyrood government has insisted no part of the religious community would be forced to hold same-sex weddings in churches. The Scottish government said; Scotland's deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said: "We are committed to a Scotland that is fair and equal and that is why we intend to proceed with plans to allow same-sex marriage and religious ceremonies for civil partnerships - we believe that this is the right thing to do. She went on: "The Scottish government has already made clear that no religious body will be compelled to conduct same-sex marriages and we reiterate that today. Such protection is provided for under existing equality laws. "However, our view is that to give certainty on protection for individual celebrants taking a different view from a religious body that does agree to conduct same-sex marriages, an amendment will be required to the UK Equality Act." The Scottish government said it was now going ahead with another consultation to consider what extra measures are needed to guarantee freedom of speech, including the protection of religious beliefs of teachers and parents in schools. Ministers said the Scottish Catholic Education Service would continue to decide on the faith content of the curriculum in Catholic denominational schools. Welcoming the government's approach, Tom French, policy co-ordinator for the Equality Network, said: "Same-sex marriage is about equality and freedom - the freedom for couples, and religious and humanist groups that want to, to celebrate same-sex marriages, but equally, upholding the freedom of other religious groups to say no to same-sex marriages. "That's the right way for Scotland to deal with the different opinions on this." The Church of Scotland, which will report on its own investigation of the issue in May 2013, expressed concern the government was rushing ahead with its plans. The Rev Alan Hamilton, convener of the Church of Scotland legal questions committee, said: "We are acutely aware that opinions differ among our own members and that many people are anxious and hurt in the current situation. "We believe homophobia to be sinful and we reaffirm our strong pastoral commitment to all people in Scotland, regardless of sexual orientation or beliefs." He added: "We are concerned the government will legislate without being able to effectively protect religious bodies or their ministers whose beliefs prevent them from celebrating civil-partnerships or same-sex marriages." A spokesman for the Catholic Church in Scotland said: "The Scottish government is embarking on a dangerous social experiment on a massive scale. "We strongly suspect that time will show the Church to have been completely correct in explaining that same-sex sexual relationships are detrimental to any love expressed within profound friendships." Civil partnerships in Scotland offer the same legal treatment as marriage, but are still seen as distinct from marriage. The UK government, which is consulting on changing the status of civil ceremonies to allow gay and lesbian couples in England and Wales to get married, wants to make the change by 2015.
The US leader vowed "strong support" for the protection of Tibetans' human rights in China during the encounter. China had urged the US to cancel the meeting, saying it would "seriously impair China-US relations". Beijing described the Dalai Lama as a separatist, while the spiritual leader said he only advocates greater autonomy for Tibet, not independence. During their meeting in the White House Map Room, Mr Obama and the Dalai Lama reportedly said they hoped talks would resume between Beijing and the Tibetan spiritual leader's representatives. The two men last met in 2011, in talks that angered China. Tibet is governed as an autonomous region in China. China has been widely accused of repressing political and religious freedoms in Tibet. Beijing rejects this and says economic development has improved Tibetans' lives. 'Firm opposition' Chinese response to the meeting was swift, with the nation's Vice-Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui summoning US charge d'affaires Daniel Kritenbrink to protest against the encounter. "China expresses strong indignation and firm opposition," Mr Zhang said, according to the Xinhua news agency. "The Tibetan issue is the domestic affair of China, and the United States bears no right to interfere," he added. "Such a move will gravely sabotage China-US co-operation and relations, and will definitely undermine its own interests." Caitlin Hayden, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council, earlier said Mr Obama met the Dalai Lama "in his capacity as an internationally respected religious and cultural leader". "We do not support Tibetan independence," she said, adding that the US "strongly supports human rights and religious freedom in China. "We are concerned about continuing tensions and the deteriorating human rights situation in Tibetan areas of China." In recent years more than 110 ethnic Tibetans - mostly young monks and nuns living in areas outside Tibet - have set themselves on fire in apparent protest against Beijing's rule. The Chinese government accuses the Dalai Lama of orchestrating the protests, a charge he strongly rejects. The Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959, after Chinese troops crushed an attempted uprising in Tibet. He now advocates a "middle way" with Beijing, seeking autonomy but not independence.
The authorities are now able to blacklist and force offline certain websites without a trial. The law was approved by both houses of parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin in July. Human rights groups have said the legislation might increase censorship in the country. The law is the amendment to the current Act for Information. The authorities say the goal is to protect minors from websites featuring sexual abuse of children, offering details about how to commit suicide, encouraging users to take drugs and sites that solicit children for pornography. If the websites themselves cannot be shut down, internet service providers (ISPs) and web hosting companies can be forced to block access to the offending material. The list of banned website will be managed by Roskomnadzor (Russia's Federal Service for Supervision in Telecommunications, Information Technology and Mass Communications). It is meant to be updated daily, but its contents are not available to the general public. Critics have described it another attempt by President Vladimir Putin to exercise control over the population. "Of course there are websites that should not be accessible to children, but I don't think it will be limited to that," Yuri Vdovin, vice-president of Citizens' Watch, a human rights organisation based in Saint-Petersburg, told the BBC. "The government will start closing other sites - any democracy-oriented sites are at risk of being taken offline. "It will be [an attack on] the freedom of speech on the internet." Mr Vdovin said that to close a website, the government would simply have to say that its content was "harmful to children". "But there are lots of harmful websites out there already, for example, fascist sites - and they could have easily been closed down by now - but no, [the government] doesn't care, there are no attempts to do so," he added. A risk for websites? Besides NGOs and human rights campaigners, websites including the Russian search engine giant Yandex, social media portal Mail.ru and the Russian-language version of Wikipedia have all protested against the law. The latter, for instance, took its content offline for a day ahead of the vote in July, claiming the law "could lead to the creation of extra-judicial censorship of the entire internet in Russia, including banning access to Wikipedia in the Russian language". Yandex temporarily crossed out the word "everything" in its "everything will be found" logo. "The way the new law will work depends on the enforcement practice," said a spokesman. "Yandex, along with other key Russian market players, is ready to discuss with lawmakers the way it is going to work." In July, the Russian social networking site Vkontakte posted messages on users' homepages warning that the law posed a risk to its future. However, the country's telecom minister Nikolai Nikiforov, suggested that such concerns were overblown when he spoke at the NeForum blogging conference this week. "Internet has always been a free territory," he said, according to a report by Russian news agency Tass. "The government is not aimed at enforcing censorship there. LiveJournal, YouTube and Facebook showcase socially responsible companies. "That means that they will be blocked only if they refuse to follow Russian laws, which is unlikely, in my opinion." There is also evidence suggesting public support for the move. A survey conducted by pollster Levada Centre in late July indicated that about 62% of those asked supported the idea of a blacklist, with only 16% opposing it.
By John SudworthBBC News, Beijing In truth, what happened in Tiananmen Square is marked faithfully each year by a massive, national act of what might more properly be called "forgettance". In the weeks leading up to 4 June, the world's biggest censorship machine goes into overdrive as a huge dragnet of automated algorithms and tens of thousands of human expurgators cleanse the internet of any reference, however oblique. Those deemed to have been too provocative in their attempts to evade the controls can be jailed - with sentences of up to three and a half years recently handed down to a group of men who'd tried to commemorate the anniversary with a product label. Merely reposting such images on Twitter - a banned platform not even accessible to most Chinese internet users - can get you detained. A few months ago, I saw for myself the extraordinary lengths to which the authorities are prepared to go to ensure that Chinese citizens engage in absolutely no public discussion or visible acts of commemoration. On China's national tomb-sweeping festival - a time when people visit the graves of their loved ones - the BBC had arranged to meet an elderly woman whose son was shot through the head on the North side of Tiananmen Square, shortly after the first troops fought their way into the city. As she does every year, 81-year-old Zhang Xianling was planning to take flowers to the small, peaceful cemetery where the ashes of 19-year-old Wang Nan are interred, close to Beijing's Summer Palace. But we found the cemetery crawling with security guards keeping watch over the family memorial stone. We were questioned by uniformed police officers who checked our passports and press cards, and took our details. And Mrs Zhang was taken to and from the cemetery under police escort in order to keep her well away from journalists. The BBC archive contains a compelling record of the events in which Wang Nan's death played only a small part. The video footage - every frame a testament to the bravery of those who filmed it - shows the soldiers advancing with weapons held at crowd height silhouetted against the burning vehicles. And it captures the panicked protesters struggling on bicycles or on foot to carry the bloodied, bullet-ridden bodies to hospital. But for me, one brief account in particular stands out. 'They begged him to stop firing' In daylight, sporadic bursts of gunfire can still be heard throughout the city and a visibly shocked British tourist, Margaret Holt, has found herself unwittingly caught up in one of the defining moments of the past century. "This gun-happy soldier, he's firing indiscriminately into the crowd and three young girl students knelt down in front of him and begged him to stop firing," she says quietly, gesturing with her hands in a praying motion. "And he killed them." She goes on: "An old gentleman put his hand up because he wanted to cross the road, and he shot him." In her late fifties or perhaps early sixties, and studying painting in a building just a few hundred yards from Tiananmen Square, Ms Holt points out of the window as she describes what happened to the soldier. "The magazine of his gun was empty so he tried to reload and the crowd came in and hung him from a tree." The whole description takes just 24 seconds. But its very brevity underscores the brutality of the force used to clear a peaceful protest, and the seething resentment of the crowds on the receiving end. It also hints at why, even today, the authorities strive so hard to bury all discussion of what took place. Winds of change The protests that rocked Beijing and dozens of other Chinese cities in that spring and summer of 1989 were sparked - as is often the case - by an entirely ordinary event: the death in April of the previously sidelined Communist Party leader, Hu Yaobang, an economic and political liberaliser. A spontaneous outpouring of public grief, led by students, quickly morphed into large-scale street demonstrations with calls for his reputation to be restored and for his legacy to be honoured with wide-ranging reforms: a free press, freedom of assembly, and an end to official corruption. In Beijing, up to a million people poured into Tiananmen Square, occupying the vast public space at the political heart of the capital in a carnival of flags and banners and tents. With the winds of change already blowing through Eastern Europe, in another chance piece of timing, the Soviet leader Michael Gorbachev arrived in Beijing in mid-May to take part in the first Sino-Soviet summit for 30 years. To China's leaders, as well as to the demonstrators on their doorstep, the country appeared to be teetering on the edge of a profound historical moment, and the Communist Party was split over how best to respond. It was the hardliners who eventually won out. Late at night on 3 June and into the morning of the next day, a full-scale military assault was launched on the square, with columns of tanks and soldiers advancing towards it firing live ammunition. At intersections along the route to Tiananmen people refused to move out of the way and were mown down in a hail of bullets. Some - as in the quote from the tourist above - fought back with their bare hands, and a number of armoured vehicles were reportedly set on fire by protesters using Molotov cocktails. Today, the ongoing secrecy and censorship makes it impossible to know how many died that night. No full, official accounting of the dead and injured has ever been made public. The various accounts from the foreign journalists who were there, many of whom visited the city's hospitals, suggest a broad consensus of anything from hundreds of dead to an upper estimate of around 2,000 to 3,000. At least one diplomatic cable, written in the heat of the moment, gives a much higher figure. What is beyond dispute is that it was a moment when a national defence force took on the role of an invading army in its own capital city, and a turning point that continues, in so many unspoken ways, to define China today. Tank Man Perhaps nothing illustrates the effectiveness of 30 years of Chinese censorship more than Tank Man. On 5 June, the day after the clearances, a column of tanks was seen leaving Tiananmen Square along Chang'an Avenue where most of the killing took place. Video footage captures a lone protester placing himself in front of the lead tank and then shuffling sideways each time it tries to move around him. At one point the man, dressed in a white shirt and black trousers and holding two shopping bags, climbs onto the tank and tries to remonstrate with the crew through the turret. For the outside world, this one iconic image - juxtaposing the authoritarian repression with the unquenchable spirit of defiance - has come to define more than any other what happened in and around Tiananmen Square. It has also been pointed out that the tank commander - who cannot have known that the long-lenses of the international media were focused on the standoff - can be credited with showing some restraint. Tank Man was not shot or run over but eventually bundled away to a fate still unknown to this day. In China though, the image has been obliterated from public consciousness. Inhuman crime Today, Tiananmen Square appears largely unchanged from the video images of 1989. Chairman Mao remains in pride of place, his pristine, slightly smiling face a continuing rebuke to the three protesters who threw paint-filled eggs at the portrait - and ended up serving jail terms of up to 20 years as a result. But beyond the square China as a country has changed immeasurably over the past three decades. As it grows ever richer and more powerful, that success might seem to offer the ultimate rebuttal to the acres of newsprint - these few paragraphs included - that insist that a dark, buried chapter of the past somehow still matters. Bao Tong is a former senior official who had a ringside seat during the political upheavals of 1989. He is now one of China's best-known dissidents, having served a seven-year sentence, all of it in solitary confinement, as a result of his support for the Tiananmen protesters. "What worries me," he says, "is that in the past 30 years all Chinese leaders have been willing to stand alongside the inhuman crime of 4 June." Referring to the idea that China owes its current success to the crackdown, Mr Bao goes on: "They treat it as a valuable lesson, as a magic trick behind the nation's rise. They consider it beneficial." "The CPC should allow people to discuss - victims, witnesses, foreigners, journalists who were there at the time. They should allow everyone to say what they know and figure out the truth." As if to prove just how vain a hope that might be, Mr Bao - who is constantly monitored and followed - was warned after our visit not to accept any more foreign media interviews. But he is certain that if the protesters' demands had been listened to all those years ago, China's future would not only have been a prosperous one, but a more balanced and equitable one too. "I see a China without a Great Fire Wall, without a privileged class. Unfortunately with less billionaires but at least the poor migrant workers could live freely without being driven out of the big cities. And a China that does not need to steal foreign technology." Power at all costs The irony of the Tiananmen protests is that despite the sense of hope, when many truly believed change had come, they may instead have pushed back the chance of political reform in China for a generation or more. Few of the students were openly calling for revolution - they would anyway have likely made poor leaders, riven as they were with factionalism, squabbling and autocratic tendencies of their own (as the best documentary made about the events makes abundantly clear). But the Communist Party hardliners saw that even the more limited demands for rule of law and increasing democratic choice would spell the end of their absolute monopoly on power. Had the protests never happened, had senior reformists not been silenced, purged or jailed, might China have followed the path of the other Asian states, Taiwan and South Korea, that had already begun their gradual, managed transition away from authoritarianism? In China, no such reckoning is possible: An older generation is not allowed to remember, a new generation is not even allowed to know. Instead, the decision that was taken is one that still holds fast today. The Party was going to hold on to power at all costs, and never again would a popular movement be allowed to try to loosen its grasp. Thirty years on, the massive "forgettance" effort continues as forcibly as ever.
But it is not clear if the ZMapp drug, which has only been tested on monkeys, can be credited with their improvement. Dr Kent Brantly was flown home for treatment on Saturday. His colleague Nancy Writebol arrived back in the city of Atlanta on Tuesday. Since February, 887 people have died of Ebola in four West African countries. US National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Tuesday that the risk of Ebola transmission in the US is "very low". "We have in this country the protocols to isolate and manage any patient who may present with those symptoms of the disease," she said. Meanwhile, another man is being tested for Ebola at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York after travelling to West Africa. The hospital said he was in isolation and "was stable overnight and in good spirits". The World Bank is allocating $200m (£120m) in emergency assistance for countries battling to contain the Ebola outbreak. It is the world's deadliest outbreak to date and has centred on Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. There have also been two cases in the Nigerian city of Lagos, where eight people are currently in quarantine. British Airways has temporarily suspended flights to and from Liberia and Sierra Leone until 31 August 2014 because of the health crisis, the airline said in a statement. It follows a similar suspension by two regional air carriers last week. The virus spreads by contact with infected blood and bodily fluids. The current outbreak is killing between 50% and 60% of people infected. There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola - but patients have a better chance of survival if they receive early treatment. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, says clinical trials are to start in September on an Ebola vaccine that has shown promising results during tests on animals. "By the middle to end of 2015, we'll be able to have some vaccine - at least to vaccinate health workers - who put themselves at considerable risk when they take care of these patients," he told the BBC's Newsday programme. The US aid workers were treated with the ZMapp serum before their evacuation from Liberia. According to a CNN report, quoting a doctor in Liberia, Dr Brantly's condition improved dramatically within an hour of receiving the drug. Service in Mission (SIM), the Christian aid group that employs Ms Writebol, says she has had two doses of the drug and did not respond as well as Dr Brantly but she is showing "improvement". "She is walking with assistance... strength is better... has an appetite," SIM spokesman Palmer Holt told the Washington Post newspaper in an email on Monday. Ms Writebol is in a special isolation ward at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, where Dr Brantly is being treated by infectious disease specialists. Three companies, the US government and the Public Health Agency of Canada are behind the experimental drug. "ZMapp was first identified as a drug candidate in January 2014 and has not yet been evaluated for safety in humans. As such, very little of the drug is currently available," Mapp Biopharmaceutical said in a statement. "Mapp and its partners are co-operating with appropriate government agencies to increase production as quickly as possible." Ebola has initial flu-like symptoms that can lead to external haemorrhaging from areas like eyes and gums, and internal bleeding which can lead to organ failure. In another development, the World Health Organization is to hold an emergency meeting in Geneva starting on Wednesday to discuss new measures to tackle the Ebola outbreak. The meeting will decide whether to declare a global health emergency which could involve imposing travel restrictions on affected countries. Ebola virus disease (EVD) Ebola: Experimental treatments Why Ebola is so dangerous
By Mike WooldridgeWorld Affairs correspondent It says the rising appeal of populist parties could see some winning elections and mainstream parties forced into previously unthinkable alliances. Europe's "crisis of democracy" is a gap between elites and voters, EIU says. There is "a gaping hole at the heart of European politics where big ideas should be", it adds. Low turnouts at the polls and sharp falls in the membership of traditional parties are key factors in the phenomenon. 'Highly destabilising' The United Kingdom - going to the polls in May - is "on the cusp of a potentially prolonged period of political instability", according to the Economist researchers. They say there is a much higher than usual chance that the election will produce an unstable government - predicting that the populist UK Independence Party (UKIP) will take votes from both the Conservatives and Labour. The fragmentation of voters' preferences combined with Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system will, the EIU says, make it increasingly difficult to form the kind of single-party governments with a parliamentary majority that have been the norm. But the most immediate political challenge - and test of how far the growing populism translates into success at the polls - is in Greece. A snap general election takes place there on 25 January, triggered by parliament's failure to choose a new president in December. Opinion polls suggest that the far left, populist Syriza could emerge as the strongest party. If it did and was able to form a government, the EIU says this would send shock waves through the European Union and act as a catalyst for political upheaval elsewhere. "The election of a Syriza government would be highly destabilising, both domestically and regionally. It would almost certainly trigger a crisis in the relationship between Greece and its international creditors, as debt write-offs form one of the core planks of its policy platform," the EIU says. "With similar anti-establishment parties gaining ground rapidly in a number of other countries scheduled to hold elections in 2015, the spill-over effects from a further period of Greek turmoil could be significant." 'Immigration and austerity' Other examples of European elections with potential for unpredictable results cited by EIU include polls in Denmark, Finland, Spain, France, Sweden, Germany and Ireland. "There is a common denominator in these countries: the rise of populist parties," the EIU says, "Anti-establishment sentiment has surged across the eurozone (and the larger EU) and the risk of political disruption and potential crises is high." Its analysis is that populist parties and movements - of the left, the right and the indeterminate - are moving into the space that has opened up between the old political parties and their traditional social base. Opposition to governance from Brussels, immigration and austerity are key themes and rallying cries for many of these parties. 'Upsurge of protests' Meanwhile, alongside the rise to prominence of populist movements, there has been an upsurge of popular protest in many parts of the world in recent years. The EIU estimates that significant protest movements surfaced in more than 90 countries during the past five years - in the main, it says, led by young, educated, middle class individuals who resent their political leaders and who prefer Twitter and other social networks to the traditional political soap box. "An upsurge of popular protest has swept through Europe, the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America in recent years. Other regions such as Asia and North America have been less susceptible, although have not escaped entirely," the EIU says. "The mainsprings of the protests have been different - some have been responses to economic distress, others are revolts against dictatorship; some are expressions of a popular desire to have their voices heard by political elites, others express the aspirations of new middle classes in fast-growing emerging markets." BBC Democracy Day All these developments pose the question of whether they do actually represent a threat to democracy or are proof that it is alive and well. If we take the Arab Spring as a springboard for democracy in a region where it was notable for its absence, the result so far of course has been decidedly limited democratic change and a great deal of upheaval. And the impact of the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, for example, is yet to become clear - protesters there dismissing Beijing's proposals for the way in which Hong Kong will be able to choose its own leader as "fake democracy". And in the world's most populous nation itself, Western-style democracy is nowhere on the horizon - though whether that position can and will be sustained indefinitely in the face of democratic trends elsewhere in Asia and the expansion of China's middle class is another question. For now, the unpredictable fate of the "old" democracies will undoubtedly be watched closely by governments and activists of all political hues around the world.
The teacher said he had been attacked while alone in a classroom in Aubervilliers, a suburb of Paris. But prosecutors said he had wounded himself with a box cutter and was now being questioned as to why he lied. France remains on high alert following the terror attacks in Paris on 13 November that left 130 people dead. The 45-year-old teacher - who has not been named - has been treated in hospital for superficial wounds to his side and neck. According to his account, a man had attacked him with a box cutter at about 07:10 (06:10 GMT) on Monday and had shouted: "This is for Daesh [Islamic State]. It's a warning". The incident sparked a manhunt in the northern suburb, as police tried to track down the alleged attacker. The anti-terrorism branch of the Paris prosecutor's office also opened an investigation for attempted murder in relation to a terrorist act. Earlier on Monday, Education Minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem visited the scene and vowed to increase security at French schools. All classes at the Jean-Perrin preschool were cancelled. Mayor of Aubervilliers Pascal Beaudet said it was not yet known what had motivated the teacher to lie. He said the teacher had 20 years' experience and was "appreciated" by parents at the school. Last month, the Islamic State's French-language magazine Dar-al-Islam recently urged followers to kill teachers in France, describing them as "enemies of Allah" for teaching secularism. Rachel Schneider, of the French primary school teachers' union SNUipp, said many teachers had been alarmed by the threat. "We have received many calls from colleagues, who are very worried," she said. "They don't necessarily think there will be an organised attack, but they fear this message of murderous madness will inspire unstable people to action." Aubervilliers is in the Seine-Saint-Denis department of the Ile-de-France region.
By Sam CabralBBC News, Washington We've been hearing from lawmakers - but what do Americans think? We asked members of our BBC voter panel to weigh in. Belinda is an attorney and devoted Trump supporter of Native American and African American ancestry. She says this second impeachment vote is wrong and misconstrues the facts of what happened last week in favour of political expediency. This is unprecedented. There is no justification, no legal or constitutional basis for this impeachment. He did not even receive due process. It's a rush to judgment for ulterior motives and a dark stain on our country. I'm afraid our Constitution is on its deathbed. I hope the American people will stand up against this outrage. It's indicative of what would happen in a communist country where we have no free speech rights. Those who broke in should be charged appropriately for whatever laws they violated. But why would anybody who's rational think that our president meant for people to go break into the Capitol? His rallies have always been peaceful and most of the people on Wednesday were middle-aged and elderly, with children and grandchildren. Individuals who violated the law should definitely be prosecuted but I don't see how you can blame someone for a speech and someone else's criminal activity. It can't be selective enforcement of the law. Melissa is a Filipino American small business owner with two children who had told us the country could not afford four more years of Donald Trump. She says the behaviour he displayed last Wednesday was undoubtedly an impeachable offense. Everything he has done is unconstitutional and, as a president, the number one thing he should be doing is upholding the Constitution. [Republican Congresswoman] Liz Cheney said that, if not for the president, last week would not have happened and she's right. If not for him continually fighting the election results, if not for him repeatedly sending the false message the election was stolen, if not for him holding that rally near the Capitol, if not for him talking about an 'uprising', last week would very likely not have happened. Even three months ago, before all the lawsuits and everything else he was saying, I was not shocked by his behaviour. It's all completely predictable because it's just within his character. So the argument by politicians that impeachment could divide us more, I don't see that as the goal of impeachment. It can't help but I don't think it will have any impact on deterring violence. There needs to be some kind of statement that the president is not allowed to attack another branch of government. It's a chance for the Republican Party to rid itself of Trump's stranglehold on them. Gabriel is a regional coordinator for the New York Young Republicans and is an outspoken 'Latino for Trump'. He condemns the violence of last Wednesday but says the reaction has been unfair and worries about where the party will go from here. I do not think that Donald Trump should be impeached. I was in DC at the rally on 6 January - I did not go near the Capitol and went back to my hotel room - but I saw the president speak with my own eyes and he did not call for anyone to storm the building or cause harm. This is just a way to ensure he will not run in the next four years. It is political and it will create a bigger divide between left and right. I fear that people will become reactionary and elected officials will use impeachment in the future not as a last resort to uphold our republic but as a tool to remove whoever they don't agree with. All violence should be condemned fairly and justly. It was a very sad outcome, but I do not believe it was the most horrible day in our country's history and it was not a coup. It's important to dictate that violence is not the answer. The day was supposed to be different. January 6 did something to the Republican Party. The actions of the few will discourage many of the new voters that Trump brought in and made his base. Williams is a first-generation Mexican American college student in Atlanta who has been extremely concerned about what he has seen in his country over the past four years. He says the events of the past week justify today's vote in the House. I believe he should have been impeached. Not only is he a threat to our national security, but he doesn't condemn white supremacy and other threats. That affects us internally within the United States as well as abroad. It's more of a symbolic impeachment at this point because he'll be out soon, but it's necessary nonetheless. Impeachment failed once, but now he has set the precedent that a president can be impeached more than once. In processing the past week, all I could do at first was to ignore it and joke about the situation. It's deeply saddening to me.
By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent The calved block covers 1,636 sq km in area - a little smaller than Scotland's Isle of Skye - and is called D28. The scale of the berg means it will have to be monitored and tracked because it could in future pose a hazard to shipping. Not since the early 1960s has Amery calved a bigger iceberg. That was a whopping 9,000 sq km in area. Amery is the third largest ice shelf in Antarctica, and is a key drainage channel for the east of the continent. The shelf is essentially the floating extension of a number of glaciers that flow off the land into the sea. Losing bergs to the ocean is how these ice streams maintain equilibrium, balancing the input of snow upstream. So, scientists knew this calving event was coming. What's interesting is that much attention in the area had actually been focussed just to the east of the section that's now broken away. This is a segment of Amery that has affectionately become known as "Loose Tooth" because of its resemblance in satellite images to the dentition of a small child. Both ice areas had shared the same rift system. But although wobbly, Loose tooth is still attached. It's D28 that's been extracted. "It is the molar compared to a baby tooth," Prof Helen Fricker from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography told BBC News. Prof Fricker had predicted back in 2002 that Loose Tooth would come off sometime between 2010 and 2015. "I am excited to see this calving event after all these years. We knew it would happen eventually, but just to keep us all on our toes, it is not exactly where we expected it to be," she said. The Scripps researcher stressed that there was no link between this event and climate change. Satellite data since the 1990s has shown that Amery is roughly in balance with its surroundings, despite experiencing strong surface melt in summer. "While there is much to be concerned about in Antarctica, there is no cause for alarm yet for this particular ice shelf," Prof Fricker added. The Australian Antarctic Division will however be watching Amery closely to see if it reacts at all. The division's scientists have instrumentation in the region. It's possible the loss of such a big berg will change the stress geometry across the front of the ice shelf. This could influence the behaviour of cracks, and even the stability of Loose Tooth. D28 is calculated to be about 210m thick and contains some 315 billion tonnes of ice. The name comes from a classification system run by the US National Ice Center, which divides the Antarctic into quadrants. The D quadrant covers the longitudes 90 degrees East to zero degrees, the Prime Meridian. This is roughly Amery to the Eastern Weddell Sea. D28 is dwarfed by the mighty A68 berg, which broke away from the Larsen C Ice Shelf in 2017. It currently covers an area more than three times as big. Nearshore currents and winds will carry D28 westwards. It's likely to take several years for it to break apart and melt completely. Follow Jonathan on Twitter.
By Paul RinconScience editor, BBC News website Their 340-day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS) is twice the length of a normal stay. Their extended tour is part of an effort to study the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the body. But scientists will gain further insights by comparing Scott Kelly with his Earthbound identical twin, Mark. A Soyuz capsule carrying Kelly, Kornienko and Russian crew member Sergey Volkov parachuted down on to a steppe in Kazakhstan at 10:26 local time (04:26 GMT). The mission is a record for the ISS and will give Cmdr Kelly a tally of 520 cumulative days in space, over four flights. In pictures: Scott Kelly's year in space Tim Peake's space plant experiment Cmdr Kelly has also returned rocket (salad) seeds that were taken up to the orbiting outpost by UK astronaut Tim Peake in December. They will be distributed to schools to allow pupils to compare their growth with rocket plants that have stayed on Earth. The idea behind the twin study is to help minimise extraneous factors as scientists research how genetically identical individuals respond to different conditions over a year. The harsh space environment takes its toll in the form of muscle atrophy, sleep problems, bone loss, vision impairment and radiation exposure. But some of the most pronounced effects are on the mind. Before landing, Cmdr Kelly told reporters during a live link-up: "Physically I feel pretty good... but the hardest part is being isolated in the physical sense from people on the ground who are important to you. There's a loss of connection." From Kazakhstan, Cmdr Kelly will be flown to Houston in the US, where researchers at the US space agency (Nasa) will begin a series of scientific checks. Mark Kelly, who was an astronaut, now retired, has been undergoing tests of his own on Earth during his brother's sojourn on the ISS. Comparisons between the twins should allow scientists to deepen their understanding of the subtle physical and psychological shifts that occur during long stays on orbit. Nasa says the research should inform its stated aim of one day sending humans to Mars. After returning from an extended stay in the weightless environment of space, many astronauts have difficulty walking unaided. Shortly after landing, Kelly, Kornienko and Volkov will enter a medical tent to participate in a series of "field tests" that will assess their balance, co-ordination and ability to walk. Returning ISS crews have immediate access to medical assistance, but future crews to Mars will have little time to recover once they land on the Red Planet's surface. Scientists want to devise ways to prevent injury and improve their recovery time. "We go through about an hour of field tests of various kinds - one is even like an obstacle course, where you run around, stand up from a sitting position and jump," Cmdr Kelly said. Despite the length of their flight, Kelly and Kornienko are still some way shy of the record for the longest single spaceflight, which is held by the Russian Valery Polyakov, who spent 437 consecutive days aboard the Mir space station in the mid-1990s. On Monday, Scott Kelly handed over command of the space station to his American colleague Timothy Kopra, who remains on the orbiting outpost with Tim Peake and the Russian Yuri Malenchenko. The next crew, consisting of the American Jeffrey Williams and the Russians Aleksey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka, is set to launch on a Soyuz rocket from Baikonur in Kazakhstan on 18 March.

All able-bodied Korean men aged between 18 and 28 are required to serve in the country's military for about 20 months. But under the revised law, certain pop stars can defer their service if recommended by the culture minister. The move will come as an early birthday present to BTS's oldest member, Jin, who is just days away from turning 28. Prior to the revision on Tuesday, military service exemptions or deferrals had been given to high-profile athletes and classical musicians. Under the revised Military Service Act, "a pop culture artist who was recommended by the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism to have greatly enhanced the image of Korea both within the nation and throughout the world" is allowed to postpone service until the age of 30. BTS-mania has swept the globe in recent years, with the boyband's popularity skyrocketing overseas. Last week they became the first K-pop group to receive a Grammy Award nomination. Their latest hit song Dynamite was nominated for the Best Pop Duo/Group Performance category, alongside stars like Lady Gaga and Taylor Swift. They also recently made history as the first all-Korean pop act to top the Billboard 100 singles chart, and the first group to have a non-English language song enter the chart at number one. Fans - known as the BTS Army - celebrated the legal change on social media. "Congratulations Jin," one wrote on Twitter. "I can't tell you my happiness." "What a time to be alive," another wrote.
The trove is believed to include works by Matisse, Picasso and Chagall, the news magazine Focus reports. Some of the works were declared as degenerate by the Nazis, while others were stolen from or forcibly sold for a pittance by Jewish art collectors. If confirmed, it would be one of the largest recoveries of looted art. Investigators put the value of the works at about one billion euros (£846m; $1.35bn), Focus said. Tax investigation The magazine said the artworks were found by chance in early 2011, when the tax authorities investigated Cornelius Gurlitt, the reclusive son of an art dealer in Munich. He was suspected of tax evasion, and investigators obtained a search warrant for his home in Munich. There, they found the cache of some 1,500 artworks which had vanished from sight during the Nazi era. The younger Mr Gurlitt had kept the works in darkened rooms and sold the occasional painting when he needed money, Focus reports. The Nazis categorised almost all modern art as "degenerate". It was banned for being un-German or for being the work of Jewish artists. Some works were confiscated or destroyed; others were sold to collectors for a low price. There are international warrants out for at least 200 of the works, Focus reports. The collection is being held in a secure warehouse in Munich for the time being. One of the pieces is said to be a portrait of a woman by Matisse which belonged to the grandfather of French TV presenter Anne Sinclair. Paul Rosenberg, an art dealer who represented Picasso as well as Matisse, was forced to leave his collection behind when he fled France in 1940. The US Holocaust Memorial Museum estimates the Nazis seized about 16,000 works of art in all. Correction 4 November 2013: We initially reported that Paul Rosenberg had fled Germany in the 1930s, which was incorrect - he fled France in 1940.
By Simon ReadBusiness reporter The average UK house price reached a record high of £252,000 in December 2020, the Office for National Statistics said. The North West had the highest growth of 11.2%, while London rose just 3.5%. The stamp duty holiday due to end this March contributed to the rise, the ONS said. Spending more time at home in the pandemic meant some people also decided they needed more space. That was reflected in the average price of detached properties climbing by twice as much as flats and maisonettes during 2020, up 10% and 5% respectively. Meanwhile Wales experienced the fastest price growth, with property values rising 10.7% to £184,000. In England, prices climbed 8.5% to £269,000, in Scotland, 8.4% to £163,000 and in Northern Ireland 5.3% to £148,000. "Recent price increases may reflect a range of factors including pent-up demand, some possible changes in housing preferences since the pandemic and a response to the changes made to property transaction taxes across the nations," the ONS said. Regional variations The UK housing market is made up of lots of local markets, with different factors affecting property prices such as the performance of schools and the availability of jobs. The ONS figures are based on sale completions. Although average London prices were up by 3.5%, over last year, prices fell in the capital by £5,000 between November and December, despite a UK-wide price increase of 1.2% over the month. But the city still has the highest average house price in the UK, at £496,000. The North East continued to have the lowest average house price at £141,000, and has become the final English region to surpass its pre-economic downturn peak of July 2007. Cheap debt "2020 was the year that fundamentals came home to roost," said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country. "There was no escaping a lack of space for households who suddenly found they were living on top of each other with little respite. That has powered annual growth that reached a six-year high." There were four major drivers of overall house price rises in 2020, said Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital. "The temporary stamp duty reduction and cheap debt as a result of very low interest rates, which give buyers a 'discount'; the release of pent-up supply and demand and desire to improve surroundings amongst existing homeowners; and the 'flight to safety', since in times of uncertainty, people want to keep their money in a stable asset with low volatility. "But looking to the future when the temporary stamp duty reduction ends, we're likely to see a slowdown in house price rises," she said. "However, there is still some life in the market as lockdown helps to concentrate many potential buyers and sellers' minds as far as moving is concerned," said north London estate agent Jeremy Leaf. "Intense speculation remains as to whether the 31 March stamp duty deadline will be extended and we can't help but have sympathy for many who have started the process several months ago who have been unavoidably delayed by a backlog in searches, surveys, conveyancing, or all three, to say nothing of problems in the new-build industry."
The bank blamed the negative effect of $2.4bn in fines and settlements and UK customer redress for the sharp fall. The results follow allegations, which emerged earlier this month, that HSBC had helped people evade UK tax using hidden HSBC accounts in Geneva. HSBC chief executive Stuart Gulliver saw his overall pay for the year fall to £7.6m from £8.03m in 2013. The lower total reflects a smaller bonus of £3.4m for the year, compared to £5.5m in 2013. Mr Gulliver said the lower bonus reflected "failures" linked to foreign exchange manipulation. Chairman Douglas Flint's total pay increased to £2.5m from £2.4m for the year, but he did not receive a bonus. Pressed after the results on whether he should have received a bonus, Mr Gulliver said his bonuses were subject to 100% clawback by the bank for seven years, enabling the bank to demand repayment "if anything turns up later that happened on my watch". Advertising controversy Mr Gulliver was also asked about the bank's policy on placing advertising in newspapers. It follows an allegation made by the former chief political commentator at the Daily Telegraph who said that the newspaper avoided writing negative stories about HSBC, so as not to lose its advertising. Mr Gulliver confirmed that HSBC does withdraw advertising from companies that publish negative editorial content. But he said it was not an effort to influence newspapers' editorial decisions. Mr Gulliver said: "We advertise in order to sell more banking products. We don't put adverts alongside hostile editorial coverage because we won't get any value for spending that advertising dollar." And Mr Gulliver went on to describe the move as "just common sense" for HSBC's marketing team. "There's nothing sinister to it at all. Genuinely, there is nothing beyond a commercial decision as to where we put our advertising." Shares slide HSBC's shares fell more than 5%, hitting their lowest level for two-and-a-half years, after it reported its fall in profit, which was larger than analysts had expected. The drop in profitability was driven by $2.4bn in fines and customer compensation costs, largely connected to fines in connection with traders' attempted manipulation of foreign exchange rates and compensation for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. The bank has been streamlining its business in an attempt to boost earnings, and Mr Gulliver said it had now closed or sold 77 businesses and lost 50,000 jobs since he took the helm in 2011. "For all the recent media furore around potential conduct issues, it is the 'underlying' performance which, we believe, should be the greatest cause of investor concern," said Investec analyst Ian Gordon. Analysis by Kamal Ahmed, BBC business editor In all the coverage of HSBC's Swiss private banking arm and Stuart Gulliver's banking arrangements (channelled through Switzerland and Panama), it is easy to miss the fact that HSBC has more broadly had a torrid year. Its return on equity (the key marker of the return a bank is making on the money it invests) has fallen from 9.2% to 7.3%. Its earnings per share are down. Its operating expenses - the amount it costs to run the bank - are up 6.1%. Fines and "redress" (in the main payments for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance) total £2.4bn. The bank has also raised significant concerns over Europe, saying that reform is "far less risky than going it alone". No wonder HSBC's share price is down 5% this morning. On Monday, HSBC reiterated its recent apology for the conduct of its Swiss private bank, saying the historical practices and behaviour were "unacceptable". The bank said restoration of trust in the industry "remains a significant challenge as further misdeeds are uncovered but it is a challenge we must meet successfully". "When commentators extrapolate instances of control failure or individual misconduct to question the culture of the firm, it strikes painfully at the heart of our identity," it added. Mr Gulliver's Swiss bank account On Sunday, Mr Gulliver himself was dragged into the Swiss tax furore, with HSBC confirming he used a Swiss bank account to hold his bonuses. The bank was responding to a report in the Guardian that Mr Gulliver has £5m in the account which he controls using a Panamanian company. HSBC said he opened the account in 1998 when he was living and working in Hong Kong and full tax was paid in Hong Kong on the bonus payments. On Monday, Mr Gulliver said he had never paid below the highest rate of UK tax on all his earnings since becoming chief executive. "I'm UK tax resident, Hong Kong domiciled. I've paid full UK tax on the entirety of my worldwide earnings. It's not surprising as a 35-year HSBC veteran that I should be Hong Kong domiciled. I would expect to die abroad, which is a test of domicility," he added. He said HSBC's computer system in the 1990s let everyone in the bank access the bank accounts of every other member of staff. As a result, he opened a bank account in Switzerland to hide his compensation from prying colleagues. He said he then used a Panamanian company to ensure HSBC staff in Switzerland also could not access his account. "Really it was to enable me to have confidentiality in my own firm. There was no tax advantage," Mr Gulliver said. Investigations The Financial Conduct Authority, HMRC, Swiss prosecutors and MPs on the Treasury Committee are looking into the allegations that HSBC helped people evade UK tax using hidden HSBC accounts in Geneva. The former director of public prosecutions, Lord Ken Macdonald, has warned that HSBC has left itself open to criminal charges in the UK over the tax-dodging scandal. The QC said there were strong grounds to investigate the bank for "cheating" HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the economy grew by 0.5% in the final three months of 2014. That was a slowdown from 0.7% growth recorded in the previous three months. Economists were mixed over whether the loss of momentum in the final quarter might be temporary or prolonged. The ONS's chief economist, Joe Grice, said it was "too early to say" if this slowdown would persist. "The dominant services sector remains buoyant while the contraction has taken place in industries like construction, mining and energy supply, which can be erratic," he said. But Nancy Curtin, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management, said the fourth-quarter figure "hardly set the world alight... and it's clear that [the economy] is slowing". She said: "There are clouds looming large on the horizon, and the general election is the biggest of these. Investors don't like uncertainty." The services sector grew by 0.8% in the quarter, but construction contracted by 1.8%. Manufacturing grew by just 0.1%, its worst performance since the start of 2013. "The main disappointment with growth in the fourth quarter was that it looks unbalanced on the output side of the economy at least," said Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight. But Chancellor George Osborne said the figures showed the economy was "on track". He warned that the international economic climate was "getting worse", and so the government must continue with its economic strategy. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said the slowdown in fourth-quarter growth was a concern, and that "Tory claims that the economy is fixed will ring hollow with working people" whose "wages are down by £1,600 a year since 2010". 'At odds' The ONS figures are the first estimate of fourth-quarter growth and could be revised up or down as more economic data for the three months is gathered by the statistics office. Economists at the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) said they "wouldn't be surprised if the ONS figures are revised up over time, painting a stronger picture for economic performance at the end of the year". The construction data which dragged down the fourth-quarter figures were "surprising and at odds with other indicators and surveys" which presented a healthier picture, the CEBR said. Tuesday figures mean the UK was among the best-performing of the all the major economies in 2014. US growth figures are due to be published on Friday, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimating expansion of 2.4% for the year. The IMF forecasts UK growth of 2.7% in 2015. However, Samuel Tombs, of consultancy Capital Economics, has predicted growth of 3%. "With the recent halving of oil prices providing a timely boost to households' discretionary spending power, credit still becoming cheaper and pay growth on an improving trend... the best days of the UK's recovery may still lie ahead," he said. Analysis: Robert Peston, BBC economics editor How significant is the slowdown in the British economy, given that the dominant service sector is still booming, but construction is shrinking and manufacturing almost back to flatlining? The deceleration is not surprising, in view of the flatlining of the UK's main trading partner, the eurozone. And two of the negative influences, a fall in energy supply of 2.8% and in construction of 1.8%, are in industries that tend to be volatile. That said, it does give pause for thought that growth is now apparently being driven to a large extent by retail and consumer spending. We were supposed to be rebalancing, towards manufacturing and investment. And although there has been a bit of that over the past couple of years, it appears to be petering out.

The lawsuit claims that when users share a link to another website via a private message, Facebook scans it to profile the sender's web activity. It alleges that Facebook systematically intercepts messages to mine user data and profits by sharing it with data aggregators, advertisers and marketers. Facebook said the allegations were "without merit". "We will defend ourselves vigorously," the world's biggest social networking site added. The lawsuit is claiming the greater of either $100 (£61) a day for each day of alleged violations or $10,000, for each user. 'Profitable opportunity' The lawsuit, filed earlier this week, cites independent research that, it claims, found Facebook reviews the contents of its users' private messages "for purposes unrelated to the facilitation of message transmission". "Representing to users that the content of Facebook messages is "private" creates an especially profitable opportunity for Facebook," it says. It says this is "because users who believe they are communicating on a service free from surveillance are likely to reveal facts about themselves that they would not reveal had they known the content was being monitored. "Thus, Facebook has positioned itself to acquire pieces of the users' profiles that are likely unavailable to other data aggregators." However, others have come forward to defend Facebook. Writing on his blog, security expert Graham Cluley said that if the site was not examining links shared privately, Facebook would be failing a "duty of care" to its users. "If you didn't properly scan and check links there's a very real risk that spam, scams, phishing attacks, and malicious URLs designed to infect recipients' computers with malware could run rife," he argued. Criticism Facebook has come under attack over its privacy policies in the past. In September last year, it faced criticism over a proposed change to its privacy policy which would have allowed ads to be created using the names and profile pictures of Facebook users. The firm had claimed that its proposal merely clarified the language of its privacy policy, rather than making any material changes to it. Facebook undertook to change the wording in the wake of a legal action launched in 2011 which saw it pay $20m to compensate users who claimed it had used their data without explicit permission.
She described a "three-day hostage situation" during which she claimed Mr Depp was on a "drug and alcohol binge". Mr Depp, 57, is suing the publisher of the Sun over an article that referred to him as a "wife beater" - but the newspaper maintains it was accurate. He denies 14 allegations of domestic violence on which News Group Newspapers is relying for its defence. Ms Heard took to the witness stand at London's High Court on the 10th day of the case, and her written witness statement was also submitted to the court. In it, she accused Mr Depp of verbal and physical abuse including screaming, swearing, issuing threats, punching, slapping, kicking, head-butting and choking her, as well as "extremely controlling and intimidating behaviour". "Some incidents were so severe that I was afraid he was going to kill me, either intentionally, or just by losing control and going too far," she said. Under cross-examination, Ms Heard later said that although there were times when she "lost her cool" with Mr Depp, it was only in self-defence. 'The monster' Ms Heard, 34, claimed Mr Depp had a "unique ability to use his charisma to convey a certain impression of reality" and "he is very good at manipulating people". "He would blame all his actions on a self-created third party instead of himself, which he often called 'the monster'. She said at the beginning of their relationship, he would be "intensely affectionate, warm and charming" and it felt like she was "dating a king". Ms Heard, who was married to the film star from 2015 to 2017, said Mr Depp had pursued her romantically while they were filming The Rum Diary in 2009 but nothing happened between them then because she was in a relationship. She said they next saw each other whilst promoting the same film in 2011, which was when their "romantic relationship" began. Her witness statement added: "When Johnny puts his attention on you, with all his intensity and darkness, it is unlike anything I've ever experienced. "When I say he was dark, he had a violent and dark way of speaking: the way he talked about our relationship being 'dead or alive' and telling me that death was the only way out of the relationship." 'Raw meat in nightgown' In her statement, Ms Heard also described visiting Mr Depp in Australia in March 2015, while he was filming Pirates of the Caribbean, and described the trip as "like a three-day hostage situation". She said during this time, there were "extreme acts" of "psychological, physical, emotional and other forms of violence". "It is the worst thing I have ever been through. I was left with an injured lip and nose, and cuts on my arms." She claimed Mr Depp grabbed her neck, shoved her against the fridge, tore off her nightgown and pushed her against a bar. "He was pressing so hard on my neck I couldn't breathe. I was trying to tell him that I couldn't breathe. I remember thinking he was going to kill me in that moment," she said. She added that she later found her nightgown, saying: "There were pieces of it wrapped round something and I realised it was the steak I had planned to cook. "He had also gone around and painted on all my clothes in the closet," she said. The court previously heard from Mr Depp, who said the top of his finger was severed when Ms Heard threw a vodka bottle at him during the trip to Australia. In her statement, Ms Heard said: "I didn't actually see the finger being cut off, but I was worried that it had happened the night before. "I figured it might have happened when he was smashing the phone on the wall by the fridge." DiCaprio 'nicknamed pumpkin-head' Ms Heard also said Mr Depp accused her of having affairs with fellow actors, and claimed she had to justify to him why she accepted film roles. "He accused me of having affairs with each of my co-stars, movie after movie: Eddie Redmayne, James Franco, Jim Sturgess, Kevin Costner, Liam Hemsworth, Billy-Bob Thornton, Channing Tatum; even women co-stars like Kelly Garner. "He also accused me of having affairs with stars I auditioned with, like Leonardo DiCaprio. He would taunt me about it - especially when he was drunk or high - and had derogatory nicknames for every one of my male co-stars he considered a sexual threat. "For example, Leonardo DiCaprio was 'pumpkin-head'. Channing Tatum was 'potato-head'." 'Not interested in money' Earlier, from the witness stand, Ms Heard told the court that she had been subjected to repeated and regular physical violence by the time of the couple's marriage in 2015. Mr Depp's lawyer, Eleanor Laws QC, asked her about her allegations regarding an argument in January 2015, and suggested it was over discussions with lawyers about a pre-nuptial agreement between herself and Mr Depp. "There was an argument in a hotel room in Tokyo that resulted in Johnny kneeling on my back and hitting me on the back of the head," Ms Heard told the court. She added: "But then Johnny was also accusing me of having an affair with a co-star and that is what led to the actual argument." Ms Heard said Mr Depp had told her he did not want a pre-nuptial agreement but it was his sister, Christi Dembrowski, who wanted the couple to get one. Ms Heard added that she had hired a lawyer who worked on a draft pre-nuptial agreement and it was sent to Mr Depp's team but never signed. She denied that she was interested in Mr Depp's money, saying: "I never had been, I never was." 'I sometimes lost my cool' She said she did not have a "problem" with controlling her temper, when challenged by Mr Depp's lawyer, who also suggested that Ms Heard would have "outbursts of rage and anger". Ms Heard said "there were times when, yes, I lost my cool with Johnny in our fights..." Ms Laws referred to a medical note written by a nurse, Erin Boerum, who wrote that Ms Heard had reported "experiencing increased anxiety and agitation and has had several outbursts of anger and rage", and also that she was "nervous about being alone while husband is working on movie set in London (and) dealing with feelings of insecurity and jealousy". Asked by Ms Laws if she felt "insecure and jealous" when she wasn't in Mr Depp's presence, Ms Heard said she had expressed "concerns" about his travel because it was a "trigger" for him, when they were apart. Only violent in 'self-defence' Ms Laws asked Ms Heard if she ever "got violent" with Mr Depp, to which the actress replied "no", adding that he put her in situations where she was faced with "unimaginable frustrations and difficulties, often that were life-threatening to me". She added that she would "try to defend myself when he got serious and when I thought my life was threatened, but I was never violent towards him". Ms Heard said it was "years into the relationship" before she tried to defend herself; adding "before that" she had "just checked out". Ms Heard was then played a recording of a conversation between her and Mr Depp, in which Mr Depp can be heard to say that he is not the one who "throws pots". In the recording, she can be heard saying that she has "thrown pots and pans". When questioned by Ms Laws on this admission, she said she threw things "only to escape" Mr Depp. 'No longer petrified' of Depp The lawyer put it to Ms Heard that she was "not injured at all" as a result of anything that happened on the night of 21 May 2016. Ms Heard had alleged that Mr Depp had thrown her mobile phone at her face, hit her in the eye, pulled her hair and grabbed her face. Ms Laws suggested that Mr Depp "didn't cause any damage whatsoever in that penthouse", to which Ms Heard said the actor had "caused damage to multiple apartments and my face... he did a significant amount of damage to the property". Ms Laws showed Ms Heard a photograph taken days after the 21 May incident, and after Ms Heard was said to have had "a four-hour meeting with your legal team". The lawyer said: "It doesn't appear as if you have got any marks on your face at all there". Ms Heard said the photo was a "paparazzi shot with long lenses", adding: "If I went out in Los Angeles, I would wear makeup, except for my court appearance." Ms Laws then suggested that, in earlier photos which are said to show injuries, she had put bruises on "yourself through makeup or lighting or any other means - it wasn't any injury from Mr Depp". Ms Heard said she disagreed "wholeheartedly" with this, adding that she had been forced to "cover up many bruises" as it was "embarrassing" to be seen with them. The lawyer added that "far from being petrified of Mr Depp", Ms Heard had, between 21 May and 27 May, contacted Mr Depp on the phone. Ms Heard she had been "attempting to", and Ms Laws said: "You were not displaying any signs of being fearful of him in those texts." Ms Heard replied: "No." Ms Laws suggested that, by the time Ms Heard and Mr Depp met in July 2016 in San Francisco, "you were no longer petrified of him". Ms Heard denied this. She alluded to her earlier statement that it was "the monster" in the relationship that she was "terrified of" and not "Johnny" whom she "loved". The libel case centres on an article published on the Sun's website in April 2018 headlined: "Gone Potty: How can JK Rowling be 'genuinely happy' casting wife beater Johnny Depp in the new Fantastic Beasts film?". The article related to allegations made by Ms Heard. The hearing is expected to last for three weeks.
The report alleged the phones were crashing due to faulty memory chips and criticised its repair policies. Samsung, which generates nearly 14% of its overall revenue from China. said it would provide free repairs for the seven models mentioned in the report. In a separate development Samsung was also fined by Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission levied a fine of fined 10m Taiwanese dollars ($340,000; £210,000) over allegations that Samsung had paid money to people to criticise rival's products. Growing scrutiny China is the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, The combination of a growing economy, rising income levels and a large consumer base has made it a key market for leading global firms. However, as foreign companies continue to grow their business in China, they have come under increased scrutiny. Samsung, which is the latest foreign firm to be criticised in the Chinese media, said in statement that it "sincerely apologises" to Chinese consumers for inconveniences caused by the company's "management problems" and that it welcomed the media scrutiny. The models mentioned in the China Central Television (CCTV) report on Samsung, which was aired earlier this week, include the Galaxy S3 and the Note2 phones. Earlier this week, a separate report on CCTV claimed that Starbucks, the world's largest coffee chain, was charging higher prices in China than in other major markets. It alleged that Starbucks earned higher margins in China due to its pricing. In April, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook apologised to Chinese consumers following two weeks of criticism by state-owned media over its repair and warranty policies, The media accused the firm of arrogance, greed and of "throwing its weight around". Taiwan trouble The fine in Taiwan came after an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission alleged that Samsung had hired the services of an advertising firm, OpenTide Taiwan, to help it with online marketing. Sun Lih-Chyun, vice chairperson and spokesman, told the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei that its investigations had indicated that OpenTide had hired students and bloggers to post remarks about Samsung and also criticise rivals' products. He added that OpenTide gave weekly and monthly reports to Samsung, on online remarks, which indicated that Samsung was fully aware of what was going on. OpenTide was also fined 3m Taiwanese dollars by the commission for its role. The allegations had first come to light in April this year. At that time, Samsung had called the incidents "unfortunate" and said they had gone against the company's "fundamental principles". In early 2013, Samsung was fined by Taiwanese authorities for an advert that misled consumers about the camera on the Galaxy Y Duo.
By Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent He told the BBC:"The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race." His warning came in response to a question about a revamp of the technology he uses to communicate, which involves a basic form of AI. But others are less gloomy about AI's prospects. The theoretical physicist, who has the motor neurone disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is using a new system developed by Intel to speak. Machine learning experts from the British company Swiftkey were also involved in its creation. Their technology, already employed as a smartphone keyboard app, learns how the professor thinks and suggests the words he might want to use next. Prof Hawking says the primitive forms of artificial intelligence developed so far have already proved very useful, but he fears the consequences of creating something that can match or surpass humans. "It would take off on its own, and re-design itself at an ever increasing rate," he said. "Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded." But others are less pessimistic. "I believe we will remain in charge of the technology for a decently long time and the potential of it to solve many of the world problems will be realised," said Rollo Carpenter, creator of Cleverbot. Cleverbot's software learns from its past conversations, and has gained high scores in the Turing test, fooling a high proportion of people into believing they are talking to a human. Rise of the robots Mr Carpenter says we are a long way from having the computing power or developing the algorithms needed to achieve full artificial intelligence, but believes it will come in the next few decades. "We cannot quite know what will happen if a machine exceeds our own intelligence, so we can't know if we'll be infinitely helped by it, or ignored by it and sidelined, or conceivably destroyed by it," he says. But he is betting that AI is going to be a positive force. Prof Hawking is not alone in fearing for the future. In the short term, there are concerns that clever machines capable of undertaking tasks done by humans until now will swiftly destroy millions of jobs. In the longer term, the technology entrepreneur Elon Musk has warned that AI is "our biggest existential threat". Robotic voice In his BBC interview, Prof Hawking also talks of the benefits and dangers of the internet. He quotes the director of GCHQ's warning about the net becoming the command centre for terrorists: "More must be done by the internet companies to counter the threat, but the difficulty is to do this without sacrificing freedom and privacy." He has, however, been an enthusiastic early adopter of all kinds of communication technologies and is looking forward to being able to write much faster with his new system. But one aspect of his own tech - his computer generated voice - has not changed in the latest update. Prof Hawking concedes that it's slightly robotic, but insists he didn't want a more natural voice. "It has become my trademark, and I wouldn't change it for a more natural voice with a British accent," he said. "I'm told that children who need a computer voice, want one like mine."
Net migration - the balance between the number of people who come to live in the UK for the long-term and the number who are leaving - fell from 242,000 to 183,000 in the year to March. The reduction was principally because of a fall in the number of foreign nationals studying in the UK. The government wants to reduce the annual figure to the tens of thousands. The Conservatives made reducing net migration a key part of their immigration policy while in opposition. Provisional data released by the Office for National Statistics on Thursday indicates that net migration in 2011-2 fell to below 200,000 for the first time since 2008-9. 'Tough policies' Over that period, inward migration to the UK fell by 42,000 to 536,000 - with the number of non-EU nationals settling in the UK falling from 317,000 to 296,000. The ONS said the fall was "largely due" to a drop in the number of foreign students despite an increase in the number of arrivals from China - the UK's largest overseas student market. At the same time, the number of people choosing to leave the UK rose from 108,000 to 127,000. Home Office minister Mark Harper said the latest figures showed the government was bringing immigration "back under control". "Our tough policies are taking effect and this marks a significant step towards bringing net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands by the end of this Parliament," he said. "At the same time, we continue to attract the brightest and best: these figures show that there has been a small increase in the number of sponsored student visa applications for the university sector." Migration Watch, which campaigns for tighter controls on immigration, welcomed the figures. "We can now see the first effects of the government's measures to reduce immigration," its chairman Sir Andrew Green said. "There is a distance to go but they are on the right track." 'Economic cost' The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said despite the lowest inward migration since 2004, the figures suggest the government still has some way to go to meet its goal to reduce net migration to below 100,000 by 2015. The net migration target has caused some tension within the coalition, with Lib Dems and some Tories - including Mayor of London Boris Johnson - believing it risks send the wrong signals to foreign students and hampering the economic recovery. And there are warnings that any fall in net migration driven by lower student numbers could come at a "significant economic cost". "Steps to reduce abuse of the student visa system are welcome but if the government's net migration target is to be met, they also need there to be a dramatic fall in the numbers of genuine students," said Sarah Mulley from the Institute of Public Policy Research. She said the 26% fall in the number of student visas issued could ultimately prove counter-productive. "The irony is that the impacts on net migration will only be short-lived because most students stay only for a short time. Reduced immigration today means reduced emigration in a year or two's time, which could see net migration rise again." The figures come on the same day the Chief Inspector of Borders John Vine warned that thousands of overseas students may have been allowed to stay in Britain illegally because UK Border Agency staff failed to check out tip-offs about them - a backlog of 153,000 had built up at one point, he said.
On a visit to the former Western Front in Verdun, he said Russia had shown it could be a threat and Europe had to be able "to defend itself better alone". Russia's president will be among world leaders marking the Armistice in Paris. Mr Macron has already proposed a joint intervention force for crisis missions. German Chancellor Angela Merkel backed the idea of an intervention force in June, but said it would have to be part of "the structure of defence co-operation". The UK, while in favour of such a joint force, is opposed to a European army, because of the potential risk of creating a parallel structure to Nato. President Macron has already warned that Europeans can no longer rely on the US to defend them, and he revived the theme on Tuesday, in response to President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of a 1987 nuclear treaty with Russia, banning medium-range ground-launched missiles. "Who is the main victim? Europe and its security," he told French radio station Europe 1. "I want to build a real security dialogue with Russia, which is a country I respect, a European country - but we must have a Europe that can defend itself on its own without relying only on the United States." Speaking about cyber security, he also said: "We have to protect ourselves with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America." Will there be a European army? By Defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus There is no evidence that any group of European countries has the political will or economic muscle to spend sufficiently on defence to make up for the United States' raw power. Indeed the deployment of troops "into harm's way" remains the ultimate sovereign decision of a national government. There is no "Nato army" today - merely an alliance of national components trained and accustomed to operating together. President Macron's call for a greater European effort in defence derives from two sets of factors: his support for the greater European project on the one hand, but also horror at much that the Trump Administration is doing on the other, with its overturning of treaties and so on. But could Europe really stand up to Russia alone? And what of the longer-term threat from China? The US relationship may be problematic but it could be becoming more important than ever. President Macron's battlefield tour will take in the River Somme as well as Verdun. 'Ultra-liberal Europe' Last week he warned of the "leprosy" of nationalism spreading worldwide and declared that he had been struck by the similarities of current times and the period between World War One and World War Two. UK Prime Minister Theresa May will join Mr Macron on Friday at the Somme while President Trump will join dozens of world leaders for Sunday's ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. During his interview on Tuesday, Mr Macron warned that there was anger against a "too ultra-liberal Europe that no longer allows our middle classes a decent living". He spoke of Europe that was becoming increasingly fractured and singled out the UK's vote to leave the EU as part of that disenchantment. President Macron's opponents have accused him of being out of touch with the everyday problems of French voters, and have called for a national protest against higher fuel taxes on France's roads on 17 November. The latest opinion poll ahead of May 2019 European Parliament elections suggests Mr Macron's LREM party is trailing the far-right National Rally party for the first time. Update 13 November 2018: This story has been updated to clarify President Macron's remarks about cyber security.
The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) awarded the singer its global artist of the year prize in recognition of her "simply phenomenal" success. Adele's achievement is particularly notable as her third album 25 was not released until late November. It went on to become the fastest selling album in British history. It sold more than 800,000 copies in its first week and with the album kept off streaming sites, its chart success was entirely made up of physical and download sales. The record's lead single, Hello, also scored considerable international chart success - becoming the first single to be downloaded more than one million times in the US. The second biggest selling artist of 2015 was Ed Sheeran - despite him not releasing a studio album during the course of the year. He kept a high profile by winning songwriter of the year at the Ivor Novello Awards and by playing a world tour that included three sold-out nights at London's Wembley Stadium. Sheeran and Adele are two of five British acts to feature in the IFPI's top 10 alongside Sam Smith, One Direction and Coldplay. Taylor Swift, who won the award in 2014, fell to number three. She also did not release an album in 2015 but did complete an 85-date tour, the highest-grossing of the year. The IFPI says its top 10 chart is the only music industry ranking to accurately capture the worldwide popularity of artists across physical formats, downloads and streams. Previous recipients of the top prize include Swift and One Direction.
The migrants had earlier broken out of a registration camp at Roszke. About 300 are on a motorway, escorted by police. Some later reportedly agreed to be bussed to a reception centre. Meanwhile, the Greek government and UN refugee agency brought in extra staff and ships to deal with some 25,000 migrants on the island of Lesbos. The processing centre has been set up on an abandoned football ground to help the stranded migrants. The hope is that the centre - which will operate for five days - will help people to buy tickets for specially chartered ships to get to Athens, the BBC's Jonny Dymond on Lesbos reports. Local authorities have been overwhelmed by the migrants who have been forced to live in squalid conditions, our correspondent adds. Athens has already requested emergency EU assistance to deal with migrants arriving from Turkey. Earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that the "breathtaking" flow of migrants into Germany would change the country in the coming years. Hungary has become a flashpoint as thousands of migrants and refugees from the Middle East and Africa move north to claim asylum in Germany and other countries. The country's defence minister, Csaba Hende, resigned on Monday, reportedly over problems with the construction of a border fence meant to keep migrants out. In other developments: Hungary had previously blocked migrants heading north, insisting they be registered there first as required under EU rules. But it dropped restrictions on Friday after struggling to cope with thousands camping in Budapest. About 20,000 migrants made their way from Hungary into Austria and Germany over the weekend. At Roszke, scuffles erupted as some migrants who had broken out of a holding centre tried to force their way past police. Stones were thrown at officers, who responded with pepper spray. About 300 managed to run to a nearby motorway, chanting "Germany, Germany". As darkness fell, they were walking, escorted by police, towards Budapest, 170km (105 miles) away. Tensions building for days: The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Hungary While Hungary has allocated $73m (£47m) to spend on a 175km (110 mile) fence along the Serbian border, no resources were devoted to humanitarian infrastructure at the police assembly point in a cornfield near Roszke. There are only four toilets, and police and aid workers struggled to feed and keep people warm as the temperatures plunged to 5C (41F). A shortage of buses to take them to a new registration centre just 2km away, and a shortage of interpreters to explain what was going on, led to the breakout from the field and a new march up the M5 motorway towards Budapest on Monday evening. What next for Germany's asylum seekers? Peston: Why Germany needs migrants more than UK What can the EU do to solve the crisis? Danish anti-migrant ads in Lebanon Nine key moments in crisis An estimated 340,000 asylum seekers have arrived in Europe so far this year, most braving dangerous sea journeys from North Africa and Turkey. Germany, where most migrants are headed and which expects 800,000 asylum requests this year, has said it wants other EU states to help shoulder the burden. But the crisis has divided the 28-nation bloc. French President Francois Hollande said mandatory quotas were being drawn up to relocate 120,000 migrants across the EU, and that France would take 24,000. Earlier, Mrs Merkel thanked volunteers who had welcomed those arriving over the weekend, saying they had "painted a picture of Germany which can make us proud of our country". However, she said that although Germany was "a country willing to take people in", it was "time for the European Union to pull its weight". Mrs Merkel is facing criticism at home over Germany's willingness to accept so many asylum seekers. The Bavarian Christian Social Union, a sister party to Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats, accused her of sending a "wrong signal". Hungary, along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania, has rejected the idea of official quotas. Prime Minister Viktor Orban said "as long as we can't defend Europe's outer borders, it is not worth talking about how many people we can take in". The Hungarian parliament last week passed tough new legislation on illegal immigrants. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Hungary says Csaba Hende's surprise resignation has been seized on by opposition parties as proof that the government's tough anti-migrant policies have failed. He oversaw army efforts to construct a razor-wire fence in just six weeks but it was rechristened a "wire barrier" in recognition of its limited success. In addition to the razor-wire barrier, the army is also building a 4m-high (13ft) fence along the border that was supposed to have been finished last month but remains largely incomplete. Meanwhile, the influx of migrants shows no signs of abating. More boatloads arrived in the Greek islands on Monday, adding to an already desperate situation in some areas. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
The woman was on a snorkelling tour at the popular Ningaloo Reef when she was struck on Thursday. It came just days after another Australian woman suffered fractured ribs and internal bleeding after being struck by a whale at the same reef. Officials said they were investigating the incidents. Unconfirmed reports said the 29-year-old woman in the first incident on Saturday was trapped between two humpback whales, which can grow up to 19m (62ft). Another woman reportedly tore her hamstring after being hit by a whale's fin. In the latest incident, 30-year-old Alicia Ramsay said she was snorkelling near the reef as part of a whale shark tour when she was approached by a humpback whale and its calf. "The calf decided to come check us out and ended up being between us and the mum so mum went into protective mode and swung back," Ms Ramsay told Nine News Perth. "As she did that to put herself between us and the calf her fin came out and got me." Ms Ramsay was flown to the Royal Perth Hospital, where doctors said she had suffered relatively minor injuries and was expected to make a full recovery. Western Australia's Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) confirmed the incident. In a statement to Australia's Seven News network, it said it licenced commercial tours in the area, including "in-water interactions with humpback whales and whale sharks." "DBCA is continuing to work with the industry and the relevant licensed tour operators to investigate the two incidents," it said. Ningaloo Reef on Western Australia's Coral Coast is known for its diversity of marine life and is one of the state's best-known tourist spots. Western Australia is home to the largest known population of humpback whales, which are typically regarded as safe to swim among despite their size. You might also be interested in watching:
The first novel in JK Rowling's series beat The Hunger Games and Roald Dahl's BFG in the Booktrust vote. Readers of all ages cast some 24,000 votes for the ultimate book to read before the age of 14. The Very Hungry Caterpillar and Winnie-the-Pooh rounded out the top five, with JRR Tolkien's The Fellowship of the Ring at number seven. Dr Seuss's The Cat in the Hat, Charlotte's Web by US author EB White and CS Lewis's Narnia fantasy classic The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe also featured in the top 10. Cinematic adaptations of popular books may have had a bearing on voters' choice, as nine of the top 10 have been turned into highly successful movies or film franchises, including the Harry Potter series. The Booktrust's head of arts ,Claire Shanahan, said: "As the biggest-ever grossing literary franchise, kids and adults alike clearly can't get enough of Harry Potter. It's a worldwide phenomena - it has captured the imaginations of a generation of readers who have grown up in love with Harry or Hermione. "Even when up against heavyweights such as Dahl and Tolkien, Rowling's creation remains the nation's firm favourite." Readers were asked to vote for their ultimate storybook to mark Children's Book Week. Booktrust experts began with a list of 500 titles, which were whittled down to 100 before being put to the vote. The titles were also grouped into age categories, and The Philosopher's Stone won in the 9-12 age group, while The Hungry Caterpillar was deemed the ultimate book for children up to the age of five.
The paper's Tehran correspondent, Jason Rezaian, is accused of "collaborating with hostile governments" and spreading "propaganda", his lawyer said. Mr Rezaian was arrested in July and charged in December but the accusations against him were not known until now. The Washington Post has called the charges "absurd and despicable". A statement from the paper's executive editor, Martin Baron, accused Iran of "indefensible silence" in having kept Mr Rezaian in jail for nine months without revealing why. It urged Iran to clear the names of its correspondent and his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, who is also a journalist and was also taken into custody in July. "The world will be watching; any just outcome to this tragic charade can result only in Jason and Yegi's exoneration and immediate release," the statement said. The US State Department said the charges against Mr Rezaian, if confirmed, were "patently absurd", Reuters news agency reports. The US is one of a team of world powers negotiating with Iran over its disputed nuclear programme. It has repeatedly pressed Iran to release Mr Rezaian and other detained US citizens. 'No access' Mr Rezaian's lawyer, Leila Ahsan, learnt of the charges after meeting him for the first time on Monday, the Washington Post says. The charges against him are said to include gathering information about "internal and foreign policy" and providing it to "individuals with hostile intent". Ms Ahsan said she had not seen any evidence against her client. She defended him, saying that as a journalist, "it is in the nature of his profession to gain access to information and publish it". "My client, however, has never had any direct or indirect access to classified information to share with anyone." Mr Rezaian, a US-Iranian citizen, is being held at Tehran's Evin prison, and is due to be tried at the Revolutionary Court, which hears national security cases. No trial date has been set. Western news organisations, including the BBC, have difficulty operating in Iran, with journalists facing detention and surveillance. Iran-based family members of BBC journalists have been questioned by intelligence services, and authorities have tried to intimidate London-based BBC Persian staff.
The US tech giant sold 40.4 million iPhones in its third quarter, slightly above forecasts of 40.02 million. Apple chief executive Tim Cook said the results reflected "stronger customer demand... than we anticipated". The firm said it expected sales to fall again in the fourth quarter to between $45.5bn (£34bn; €41.4bn) and $47.5bn. Demand for Apple's flagship product has been slowing since the second quarter when the firm reported the first drop in iPhone sales since their 2007 launch. The iPhone makes up for around two-thirds of Apple's sales and accounts for even more of its profits. The slowdown in iPhone sales sent profit down 27% to $7.8bn in the three months to 25 June, while revenues fell 14.6% to $42.4bn. Apple's sales in Greater China - defined by the company as China, Hong Kong and Taiwan - plunged 33%. The firm blamed economic uncertainty and people not upgrading their phones as often for the drop. China accounts for almost a quarter of Apple's sales, more than all of Europe combined. "It is very clear that there are some signs of economic slowdown in China, and we will have to work through them. "We understand China well and we remain very, very optimistic about the future there," said Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri. Apple shares surge Results were also hit by the impact of a stronger dollar. Nonetheless, shares, which have fallen almost 20% over the past year, rose over 7% in after-hours trading because the firm's overall performance was not as bad as analysts had expected. Mr Maestri said comparisons to the second quarter last year, when iPhone 6 sales surged 35%, made its performance seem worse than it was. He also pointed to its services business, which includes the App Store, Apple Pay, iCloud and other services, as a bright spot. The division made nearly $6bn in revenue, up 18.9% from the same time last year, and is now the firm's second-largest sales generator after the iPhone. The shift is good news for the firm because it allows it to make more money from its existing users.
Cabbies gathered at Trafalgar Square at 14:00 BST for the hour-long protest. The drivers are angry about what they regard as a lack of regulation of the use of apps such as Uber. The app works out the cost of journeys and cab drivers say it is the same as using a taxi meter, which only black cabs are legally entitled to use. The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) also said part of the demonstration was about highlighting the length of training - between four and seven years - that taxi drivers undergo before being licensed. During the protest, roads were gridlocked around Parliament Square, Whitehall and Trafalgar Square. Steve McNamara, from the LTDA, said: "We did not set out to cause disruption to Londoners. "It is nothing to do with technology, some of the taxis have been using apps for years. The difference is all taxis have to operate legally, they [Uber] should have to apply for the same rules as everyone else." He added that two drivers had been arrested and 10,000 drivers had attended the protest. But Scotland Yard denied any arrests had been made and Transport for London estimated that about 4,000 drivers had taken part. Despite the protest, Uber said it had seen the number of people downloading its app increase by 850% compared to last Wednesday. The Metropolitan Police had imposed strict conditions on protesters, including limiting the protest to an hour, after they failed to meet officers to discuss their plans. Ch Sup Pippa Mills said, "Those who took part in today's protest complied with the timings set by police. "However, we would always encourage organisers to meet with us to discuss their plans in advance so that they can achieve their aims around protest and we can ensure that disruption to the broader community is minimised." Steve Garelick of the GMB union said: "I can categorically refute the claim that police have contacted me about this protest." BBC London 94.9's Anna O'Neill said Haymarket was brought to a standstill and at one point cabs were prevented from accessing Trafalgar Square. Some motorists sat on the pavements as they waited for the protest to end. David Batist, 28, said although he had received an email alert from TfL warning him about the potential disruption it had been worse that expected. "I didn't expect this. I would've taken a different route, had I known. It's caused me quite a lot of disruption. I've had to cancel a meeting." Black cab driver Bernie Doyle, 68, said: "If Paris, Milan and Berlin don't accept it why should we? I've been driving 42 years and I'm not about to see my trade go down the pan." Stewart Rose, who has been been driving since 1971, said: "It's the beginning of the end for us. If Uber can do it what's going to stop other companies from getting this app? "Why did they award them the licence before it went to court, they've done it the wrong way round." Organisations including the Rail and Maritime Transport union, London Cab Drivers Club and Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) were represented at the protest. Some in Trafalgar Square were heard chanting "Boris, Boris, Boris, out, out, out", while others beeped horns and held placards. Uber launched in 2009 and operates in more than 70 cities across 37 countries. While those opposed to it are concerned unlicensed drivers are being contacted via the app, with no checks on whether they are legitimate, Uber said "every driver meets all local regulations" and is vetted with insurance and background checks. TfL is seeking a High Court ruling on whether the use of such an app is legal. The protests in London follow similar demonstrations in Paris, Madrid, Rome, Milan and Berlin.
By Jessica SherwoodBBC News But for some women, Halloween is not just a once-a-year holiday reserved for children. It's a job. Ellie, 21, is a professional body painter and social media star from Edinburgh, who has made a career out of Halloween. "It's one of my favourite times of the year," she says. "Halloween gets mad in the makeup world." Ellie found fame as a beauty influencer on Instagram, where she creates spellbinding looks which blur the line between beauty and horror. Ellie's account had humble beginnings and was originally used to post her Halloween looks before she began painting them all year round. "I have always been artistic. I studied art and performance at school, and one Halloween I put it all into practice. "Everyone was going to the Halloween disco as pretty things and I arrived as a horrible creepy clown. That was it really, everyone thought it was quite cool." As well as working with brands on Instagram, Ellie also works as a freelance body painter - going to houses and events to turn people into various horror creations. Ellie says she is often approached by people to produce an array of looks they have seen online or in film, but that ultimately people enjoy their own take on characters. "The cinema is always a good source of inspiration for people," she says. "Pennywise from It and Maleficent are very popular this year. "You do get different ones though. The other day I got asked to do a pretty version of Shrek." She says there is a spike in British interest in Halloween due to American influencers online. "People want more from Halloween because of how they see it online," she says. "People see it as a chance to be daring and to transform yourself. "Makeup is evolving so much. Everyone is going bigger and wilder and having more fun with Halloween, and that is partly because of what they see online." Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ellie finds Halloween is her busiest time as a body painter in terms of brand deals and her work. "With my style a lot of companies only notice me at Halloween," she says. "Which is fine. It's what I love to do and I'm grateful." You may also like: "Often the first port of call for beauty inspiration is social media" says Holly Stewart, head of brand for online cosmetics retailer Beauty Bay. "We know that our customers spend hours researching on channels such as Instagram and love to seek inspiration this way. She notes that in recent years there has been more of a demand for products specifically dedicated to Halloween, to help users achieve the looks they have been seeing online. "Makeup application is now a pivotal part of creating a Halloween look. Beauty Bay now [offers] specific Halloween ranges from our retailed brands, this can be bundles of looks, for example, a five-minute cat look or single products." Influencers can make money from sponsorship and endorsements from companies selling beauty products. But the most lucrative strategy is to launch and sell their own product lines. For example, the American YouTube star and body painter Lex Fleming, 26 from Chicago, regularly works with cosmetics brands during the Halloween period and is known for her conceptual and intricate looks. "The 'Pumpkin King' is my first look that really took off," she says. "It was based on my interpretation of Jack Skellington from the Nightmare Before Christmas. "I see it all over the internet in various styles and colours now." Lex began her YouTube channel seven years ago to showcase her talent and connect with others. She now has 2.7 million subscribers. "I know what it's like to be the odd kid," she says. "YouTube showed me that you are never truly alone. "To my absolute shock, I've grown an online family that all share my weird and creative soul." As well as collaborating and endorsing brands, Lex runs her own business selling makeup brushes which she markets as "perfect for beauty or monsters". "After gaining an incredible amount of supporters from around the world, I took steps to pursue my dream of my own cosmetic line and cosmetic brushes," she writes on her website. "My main goal is to provide the best quality of products to give others the confidence to express themselves on a living, breathing, canvas." Lex discovered her love of body painting when she was 14 when she began experimenting with eye-shadow to create looks she used as a form of escapism. "Bullying was rough for me in high school," she says. "I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. "I would come home from school and turn myself into different characters and imagine how they might handle this kind of stress in life. "I may not be a superhero, but I like to believe I can paint a pretty good one." Despite her large following, she urges others to embrace their own individuality and not pay too much attention to what's popular online. "When I first started on YouTube, many people were open to different and original ideas," she says. "It seems to be more of a trend to look like one individual online, than it is to embrace your individuality. "I would love to see a swing of things in the future where people become inspired to be themselves, instead of wanting to change into someone else."
Imports meanwhile fell 12.3% in yuan terms compared to forecasts for a fall of more than 11%. The numbers mean the country's monthly trade surplus has shrunk to its smallest in 13 months. China's economy grew by 7.4% in 2014, its weakest for almost 25 years. Analysts said recent indicators showed further signs the slowdown is continuing. In US dollar terms, China's exports for the month fell 15%, while imports fell 12.7%. Currency conversion factors based on US dollar and Chinese yuan movements over the last year mean some official numbers from the mainland are now reported in both currencies. The official March data leaves the country with a monthly trade surplus of 18.16bn Chinese yuan ($2.92bn; £1.99bn). In February, China's monthly trade surplus hit a record $60.6bn, as exports grew and imports slid back. Unexpected Analysts said the export numbers for March were a surprise. "We can understand the imports fell because of falling imports of commodities, but exports fell so much, it was very much unexpected," said Shanghai-based analyst Nie Wen from Hwabao Trust. However, he said one major reason for the falling exports was yuan appreciation. Tony Nash, global vice president of Delta Economics, said the numbers took in the lunar new year period which was typically a bit volatile. "We usually average February and March to get a true picture of what's actually happening," he told the BBC. "If we look at February's 48% rise in exports and March's 15% fall in exports, we get a moving average of 16.7%, which is closer to where we've seen exports over the past two months." But Mr Nash said Delta Economics was expecting a further slowdown going forward. "In the second quarter, we'll look for an average of 9.9% year-on-year export growth and 11.7% import growth," he said. "Trade will fall towards the back half of the year and we will look for average export growth in 2015 at 8.7% year-on-year, and import growth at 10.3% year-on-year.
In a speech in Liverpool, the prime minister said groups should be able to run post offices, libraries, transport services and shape housing projects. Also announcing plans to use dormant bank accounts to fund projects, Mr Cameron said the concept would be a "big advance for people power". Voluntary groups and Labour have queried how the schemes will be funded. The idea was a central theme in the Conservative general election campaign and Mr Cameron denied that he was being forced to re-launch it because of a lack of interest first time around. While reducing the budget deficit was his "duty", he said giving individuals and communities more control over their destinies was what excited him and was something that had underpinned his philosophy since he became Conservative leader in 2005. "There are the things you do because it's your passion," he said. "Things that fire you up in the morning, that drive you, that you truly believe will make a real difference to the country you love, and my great passion is building the big society." 'People power' The prime minister said community projects would be established in four parts of the UK - Liverpool; Eden Valley, Cumbria; Windsor and Maidenhead; and the London borough of Sutton - as part of efforts to "turn government completely on its head". Each of the project areas - which Mr Cameron said had approached ministers asking to be involved - will be given an expert organiser and dedicated civil servants to ensure "people power" initiatives get off the ground. The initiatives being championed include a local buy-out of a rural pub, efforts to recruit volunteers to keep museums open, support to speed up broadband supply, and giving residents more power over council spending. These schemes and others in the future, he said, would represent "the biggest, most dramatic redistribution of power from elites in Whitehall to the man and woman on the street". In the past, he said, the talents and initiative of people had been wasted, claiming that over-centralised government had turned public sector workers into the "weary, disillusioned puppets of government targets". Mr Cameron acknowledged the transformation he was seeking would not happen overnight and stressed it was not a matter of the government stepping aside and letting people fend for themselves. "Of course there is not one lever you can simply pull to create a big society," he said. "We should not be naive enough to think that simply if government rolls back and does less, then miraculously society will spring up and do more. "The truth is we need a government that helps to build a big society." As well as encouraging greater volunteering and philanthropy, Mr Cameron confirmed plans to use funds stuck in dormant bank and building society accounts to enable "some of the most dynamic" charities, social enterprises and voluntary groups to take over the running of public services. It is hoped that hundreds of millions of pounds will eventually be available in start-up funding through a Big Society Bank, to be matched by private investment. 'Cut-price alternative' Mr Cameron rejected suggestions that the plans were "cover" for substantial cuts in public services due next year and that the public were either confused by or uninterested in the proposals. "I don't accept that people don't understand what this is," he said. Everyone was aware of the "great work" that volunteers were already doing in communities up and down the country, he said, and it was his ambition to simply expand this. "It is incredibly simple idea and one, I think, is catching on," he said. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Tessa Jowell called Mr Cameron's speech "a brass-necked rebranding of programmes already put in place by a Labour government". She added: "We welcome the coalition's decision to continue our work in partnership with local communities, but these projects are dependant on funding and resources being put in place. "It is therefore highly unlikely that civil society will become 'bigger' due to the large public spending cuts that are being put forward by this government." Voluntary groups broadly welcomed the idea but expressed concerns about how equipped they were to take on more responsibility, given that public funds were likely to be cut as part of the budget squeeze. "It is going to be very challenging for them to play a bigger role if they have less resources to do it," said Ben Kernighan, from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. And union leaders said public services must be based on certainty of provision and not whether there were enough volunteers on any given day. "Make no mistake, this plan is all about saving money," Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said. "The government is simply washing its hands of providing decent public services and using volunteers as a cut-price alternative."
Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, refused to board a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait on Monday and barricaded herself into her airport hotel room. She said she had renounced Islam, which is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. The UN's refugee agency has referred her case to Australia for possible resettlement. Thai immigration officials had initially said she should return to Kuwait, where her family were waiting. She then started a social media campaign, live-tweeting her case and attracting international attention. In a brief statement, Australia's Department of Home Affairs said it would "consider this referral in the usual way". Ms Mohammed al-Qunun posted a message on Twitter following the announcement, saying: "Don't let anyone break your wings, you're free. Fight and get your rights!" Refugee status is normally granted by governments, but the UNHCR can grant it where states are "unable or unwilling to do so", according to its website. The UNHCR says it does not comment on individual cases. Now that Ms Mohammed-al Qunun has been given this status, another country must agree to take her in. Officials in Australia have hinted that her request will be accepted. "If she is found to be a refugee, then we will give very, very, very serious consideration to a humanitarian visa," Health Minister Greg Hunt told the ABC network before the UN determination was made public. But Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton warned there would be "no special treatment" for Ms Mohammed al-Qunun. 'Rahaf is an inspiration' 'Sara', Saudi woman speaking to BBC OS on the World Service Rahaf is an inspiration. But she's not the first one who did this and definitely not the last one. What we are going through is awful. We think about this every day because us women here do not know what it feels like to go out. We don't know what freedom tastes like. Dad keeps my passport with him all the time, we go to hotels and he puts it next to him when he sleeps. Unfortunately it's not a revolution. Every girl that is tweeting about this, it's either that she has already escaped or she's using a fake account like me. Some people tweeted me or DMed me to tell me to use my real account, for me to be brave. We do not want the guardianship any more. I want to go out of the house and drink coffee from Starbucks. I don't have to take my whole family. This is just way too harsh on us. Living this life is exhausting. Why did she claim asylum? Renunciation of Islam is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. "My life is in danger," she told the Reuters news agency. "My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things." A spokesperson for her family told the BBC that they did not wish to comment and all they cared about was the young woman's safety. Campaign groups like Human Rights Watch (HRW) have expressed grave concerns for Ms Mohammed al-Qunun. Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director off HRW, told Reuters: "She said very clearly that she has suffered both physical and psychological abuse. She said she has made a decision to renounce Islam. And I knew once she said that, she is in serious trouble". On Tuesday morning she retweeted her original appeal for asylum, pleading for the UK, Canada, the US or Australia to take her in. How did the case unfold? Ms Mohammed al-Qunun says she was on a trip to Kuwait with her family when she fled on a flight on 4 January. She was trying to head to Australia via a connecting flight in Bangkok. Because she did not have a visa to enter Thailand, Thai police had denied her entry and were in the process of repatriating her, an official said. She began to live-tweet her ordeal, sharing her Twitter password with friends so they too could assist in spreading the message on social media. But some social media users in her own country strongly criticized her actions. A video showed how she resisted deportation efforts by hiding in an airport hotel room, putting a table against the door to stop people from entering. She told the BBC: "I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want." Ms Mohammed al-Qunun has been housed in a secure location in Bangkok since Monday night, when the Thai government allowed her to leave the airport. Her father and brother have arrived in Thailand but she is refusing to see them. Thailand's immigration chief Surachate Hakparn said the pair would remain there until it was clear where Ms Mohammed al-Qunun would receive asylum. Mr Surachate said the father had denied allegations that the family were abusing her physically and emotionally. "He wanted to make sure that his daughter was safe... he told me that he wanted to take her home," he said. What is Australia's policy on asylum seekers? Many asylum seekers have tried to reach Australia on boats from Indonesia, often paying large sums to people smugglers. Hundreds have died. In 2013, the government introduced tough new policies to "stop the boats". Military vessels patrol Australian waters and intercept migrant boats, often towing them back to Indonesia. This and other policies have significantly curbed the number of boat journeys. Hundreds of asylum seekers who reached Australian shores years ago are held in offshore processing centres, which rights groups say expose them to widespread psychological harm. But the country has taken 656 refugees per 100,000 people through UN refugee agency resettlement schemes, more than twice as many as the United States.
The deficit is more than treble 2015's loss of £2bn. It is the ninth year in a row RBS has failed to make a profit. The loss came as the bank set aside more money to deal with legal action in the US and its abandoned attempt to spin off its Williams & Glyn business. RBS plans to cut costs by £2bn over the next four years, which will mean job cuts and further branch closures. Chief executive Ross McEwan told the BBC the cost cuts were "huge, and unfortunately there will be job losses amongst that". "Branches have been closing and will continue to close. The shape of a branch is changing, and what people do in a branch is changing," he added. Simon Jack: Why is RBS still losing money? The bank - which is 72%-government owned - has racked up more than £50bn of losses since the £45.5bn taxpayer bailout during the financial crisis. In the bank's results statement, Mr McEwan said: "The bottom-line loss we have reported today is, of course, disappointing but, given the scale of the legacy issues we worked through in 2016, it should not come as a surprise. "These costs are a stark reminder of what happens to a bank when things go wrong and you lose focus on the customer, as this bank did before the financial crisis." A big chunk of RBS's loss in 2016 - which was more than triple the previous year's loss of £2bn - was down to it setting aside £5.9bn for fines and legal costs. The US Department of Justice is pursuing the bank over the sale of mortgage-backed securities prior to the 2008 financial crisis. RBS has also had to cover legal costs associated with payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling. The bank's 2016 losses included a £2.1bn charge for restructuring costs. It also paid £1.2bn to the Treasury in dividends. However, Mr McEwan said he expected RBS to return to profit by the end of 2018, and pointed out that when one-off charges were stripped out, the core business of the bank was making money. "We made good progress throughout 2016 against our strategy. Our core business generated £4.2bn in adjusted pre-tax operating profit for the year," he said. "This bank has great potential. We believe that by going further on cost reduction and faster on digital transformation we will deliver a simpler, safer and even more customer-focused bank." To get the bank into profitability, Mr McEwan told the BBC that the bank needed to resolve its US legal issues and the question of its Williams & Glyn unit, which lends to small and medium-sized businesses. The European Union ordered RBS to sell the unit by the end of 2017 to address competition concerns, but last year RBS failed to sell the business to Santander and talks with Clydesdale Bank failed. Instead, RBS and the government have suggested the bank gives £750m - which the bank has set aside - towards initiatives designed to boost competition in UK business banking. Richard Hunter, head of research at Wilson King Investment Management, said: "RBS remains the 'jam tomorrow' bank after revealing another set of ugly numbers which underline the scale of the issues it continues to face. "The eye-watering costs associated with the bank's ongoing litigation and conduct fines are the main culprit for the performance, whilst the uncertainty around the Williams & Glyn business, as well as the need for a radical change to the middle and back-office restructure, are further challenges." RBS in numbers Separately, Asian-focused bank Standard Chartered reported that it had swung back into profit in 2016. It recorded a pre-tax profit of $409m (£326m), compared with a $1.5bn loss the year before, after paring back costs following a restructuring programme which has led to thousands of job losses. However, Standard Chartered said it would not pay a dividend as its restructuring programme was not yet complete. "We have many challenges still, but we have the resources, the capability and the will to overcome them," said chief executive Bill Winters "Our financial returns are not yet where they need to be and do not reflect the earnings capability we believe we possess."
Relations between Gibraltar and Spain have deteriorated in recent weeks. But the Ministry of Defence said the visit was "long-planned" and one of many "regular and routine deployments". HMS Westminster, accompanied by two auxiliary ships, makes up part of a task force which is destined for the Middle East. 'Granted permission' Other warships in the task force will visit ports in Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and Malta. "Gibraltar is a strategic base for UK defence and as such Royal Navy ships visit its waters throughout the year as part of a range of regular and routine deployments," an MoD spokesman said. Spain's foreign ministry agreed that the visit was "routine", adding that the UK government had asked for permission to stop over at the Rota naval base, which is near the Strait of Gibraltar in south-west Spain. "They asked for permission for the operation and in our relationship as allies, we granted it," a Spanish foreign ministry spokesman told Reuters news agency. On Wednesday, a spokesman said UK Prime Minister David Cameron had raised "serious concerns" with his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy over deteriorating diplomatic relations between the two countries. The call followed concerns over increased vehicle checks at the border between Spain and Gibraltar causing major delays for tourists and residents. And the Spanish foreign minister has mooted bringing in a new 50 euro (£43) fee on every vehicle entering or leaving the British territory. The checks followed a decision by Gibraltar to drop 70 concrete blocks into the sea into disputed waters just off its coast, which Gibraltarian authorities said would create an artificial reef and encourage sea life to flourish. The Spanish government has accused Gibraltar of laying the blocks "without the necessary authorisation" in "waters that are not theirs", contravening environmental laws and damaging Spain's fishing industry.
The embassy in Sanaa will be closed on Sunday and Monday, as will the embassies of France and Germany. The US reportedly intercepted al-Qaeda messages and will shut at least 21 embassies and consulates on Sunday. Interpol issued a separate global security alert, citing jail breaks linked to al-Qaeda in nine countries. The international policing organisation said "hundreds of terrorists" had been freed during breakouts in countries including Iraq, Libya and Pakistan in the past month. Interpol said al-Qaeda was suspected of "involvement in several of the breakouts" and asked its 190 member states to help "determine whether any of these recent events are co-ordinated or linked". 'Viable plot' The British embassy in Yemen had already been operating with a reduced staff "due to increased security concerns". A Foreign Office spokesman said the closure was a "precautionary measure" and would not say if it was due to a specific threat, but a number of British embassies in the Middle East have been warned about increased risks. Security analyst Peter Bergen said militant group al-Qaeda had previously showed "strong interest in launching attacks" on the 27th day of Ramadan, which is on Sunday. Robin Simcox, a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society, which monitors threats from al-Qaeda, told the BBC he believed US authorities had intercepted communications "between senior al-Qaeda leaders talking about an operational and clearly viable plot against an embassy". The claim was reported by the New York Times. Mr Simcox said it was unclear which embassy was to be targeted, but Yemen is a high-risk country because al-Qaeda's "most active franchise" is based in the Arabian Peninsula and the US has stepped up drone attacks in Yemen in recent days. He said there had been a "lull" in the drone attacks in Yemen in the past two months, and said the sudden increase suggested the latest threat was "emanating from Yemen itself". Hundreds of Britons are thought to be living in the country. A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We keep travel advice and the security of our staff and missions under constant review. "Our travel advice advises particular vigilance during Ramadan, when tensions could be heightened. We are particularly concerned about the security situation in the final days of Ramadan and into Eid." The Islamic holy month ends next week. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: "The government must also now urgently review security at Britain's other postings in the region given moves by other countries to withdraw staff for their security." 'Leave now' Iona Craig, the Times' correspondent in Yemen, said very few British people now remain in the country, mostly working for the embassy, charities, UN organisations and oil companies. She said "the threat to foreigners here has definitely increased" in recent months. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme British embassy staff in Yemen now live on-site, following two attacks in 2010. On its website, the Foreign Office was already advising against all travel to Yemen and urging British nationals to "leave now". It says there is "a high threat from terrorism throughout Yemen" and "a very high threat of kidnap from armed tribes, criminals and terrorists". Unlike the US, the UK is keeping its embassies in Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Iraq open, but it has advised staff to "exercise extra vigilance". In a statement, the US state department said: "Current information suggests that al-Qaeda and affiliated organizations continue to plan terrorist attacks both in the region and beyond, and that they may focus efforts to conduct attacks in the period between now and the end of August." The US issued a global travel alert on Friday, saying al-Qaeda was planning attacks. BBC state department correspondent Kim Ghattas said it was "not unusual" for the US to issue travel warnings, but said "this one is both wide-ranging and somewhat specific".
Officials said the newly built Weizhou Grand Mosque in the Ningxia region had not been given proper building permits. But worshippers refused to back down. One resident said they would not "let the government touch the mosque". China has a Muslim minority of some 23 million, and Islam has been prominent in Ningxia for centuries. But human rights groups say there is increasing official hostility towards Muslims in China, and foreign religious influences in particular. The mosque, which has several soaring minarets and domes, is built in a Middle Eastern style. For centuries Hui Muslim mosques were built in a more Chinese style, and it appears that the new structure is viewed by the local government as an example of a growing Arabisation of Chinese Islam, the BBC's China correspondent, Stephen McDonell, reports. How did the protests begin? Officials had on 3 August posted a notice that the mosque would be "forcibly demolished" as it had not been granted the necessary planning and construction permits. The notice was shared online among the ethnic Hui Muslim community, according to Reuters news agency. Many questioned why the authorities had not stopped construction of the mosque, which took two years to complete, if it had not been granted relevant permits, according to the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post newspaper. Protests were held outside the mosque on Thursday and continued into Friday, say the reports. Pictures circulating on Chinese social media showed large crowds gathering outside the large white building. One resident said talks between the Hui community and the government had reached an impasse. "We're just in a standoff," the resident, who withheld his name, told the Post. "The public won't let the government touch the mosque, but the government is not backing down." However, an official from the local Islamic Association said that the mosque would not be demolished entirely. He told Reuters news agency the government only wanted the structure "renovated to reduce its scale". Later reports suggested that the authorities had agreed to remove eight domes. But one of the protesters was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying that this proposal was unacceptable to the Muslim community. The protester added that the mosque had been conducting prayers attended by thousands of people and had been built with donations from congregants. There has been no comment so far in Chinese state media. Can you freely practise religion in China? In theory, China's constitution guarantees religious freedom but in practice religious activities remain tightly controlled by the government. Christian churches, for example, have in the past been forced to remove crosses from their roofs, after the government said the symbol broke planning rules. In recent years, the atheistic Chinese Communist Party has become particularly wary of foreign religious influences and authorities have embarked on a campaign to "sinicise religion" - ie make it more Chinese. As part of that, they have targeted unofficial "house churches" connected to overseas missions where millions of Chinese Christians worship. While Hui Muslims have largely been well-integrated and left mostly free to practise their religion, they have watched as Uighur Muslims in the western Xinjiang region have faced growing government pressure. Rights groups say citizens in Xinjiang are subject to increasingly intrusive methods of government surveillance and control, with many punished for "extremist" behaviour like wearing veils in public places, or refusing to watch public TV programmes. Thousands of Uighurs are also believed to have been forcibly sent to "education camps". According to Human Rights Watch, detainees are forced to renounce their ethnic and religious identities. But the current move to demolish the Ningxia mosque is an indication that the government is now looking to extend control over other Muslim ethnic minorities, says rights group Amnesty International. Earlier this year, in neighbouring Gansu province, children under 16 in the region of Linxia were banned from religious activities, in a move that alarmed Hui imams. "It's clear that the Chinese government's hostility towards Muslims in China is not only limited to Uighurs," researcher Patrick Poon told the BBC. "Hui Muslims are generally considered less vulnerable to crackdowns, but this incident proves that the government is determined to use a holistic and heavy-handed approach towards all Muslim ethnic minorities in China."

By Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political reporter We know Scottish voters will be asked one question and that 16 and 17-year-olds will be allowed to take part. But a lot remains unanswered. It's unlikely to be uppermost in the minds of Scottish voters, but what happen to Wales if Scotland decides it's had enough of the United Kingdom? Former First Minister Rhodri Morgan says it would put Wales in an "impossible position". He has compared the UK to an English elephant and three Celtic fleas. So if Scotland buzzes off will it be more difficult for Wales to make its voice heard? Mr Morgan's successor, Carwyn Jones - no fan of Scottish independence - says these questions must be confronted before the Scots go to the ballot box. A House of Commons made up of 550 MPs, 510 of them English, would be "no good to us at all," Mr Jones has said. In a lecture last year he said that without Scotland, the UK would be a "very different thing" and its constitutional relationship with Wales "would require a much more radical reconsideration". Raised eyebrows This could mean more law-making powers are devolved from Westminster to Cardiff, he has suggested, or the creation of a new upper House of Parliament, modelled on the US Senate with equal representation for Wales, Northern Ireland and England. He has even raised eyebrows - and hackles - with a suggestion that Wales could take care of Britain's nuclear fleet if it wasn't welcomed in an independent Scotland. And what about the way Wales and Scotland are funded by the Treasury? Since the late 1970s both countries have received an annual block grant. Its size changes from year to year on the basis of the Barnett formula. There is a growing consensus in Wales that the formula should be replaced with something that better reflects an assessment of what Wales needs. The economist Gerry Holtham, an adviser to the Welsh government, says that under the formula, Scotland is "overfunded by about 15%". But even if Scotland's membership of the UK is a barrier to Barnett reform, that does not necessarily mean its departure from the UK would leave more money for Wales. Put bluntly, you get what you ask for. "On the whole, the Welsh have no cards, so they will get what they have always got, which is nothing," Prof Holtham told a House of Lords committee. Not everyone is as worried about Wales's role in the UK. Perhaps, because they think Wales shouldn't be in the UK at all. Plaid Cymru has become more vocal about its ambition for Welsh independence over the last year. Party leader Leanne Wood has predicted Wales will be independent within a generation. One of her former leadership rivals, Elin Jones, said Plaid would have a mandate for an independence referendum of its own if it wins the next two assembly elections. It is a minority point of view. While a majority of people think the assembly should acquire some influence over the amount of tax they pay, a BBC Wales poll in March showed support for full-blown independence remained weak, with 7% backing it. Would that number rise if Scotland votes yes? Perhaps we should add it to the growing list of questions about what this referendum means for Wales.
The 44-year-old aid worker was seized in Syria in 2013. He was being held by Islamic State militants who have already killed two US captives. The latest video also includes a threat to kill a second British hostage. The PM vowed to do everything possible to find the killers. Mr Haines's family said he would be "missed terribly". Born in Holderness, East Yorkshire, Mr Haines went to school in Perth and had been living in Croatia with his second wife, who is Croatian, and their four-year-old daughter. His parents live in Ayr. 'Despicable and appalling' In a statement released by the Foreign Office, Mike Haines said his brother, a father of two, "was and is loved by all his family". "David was most alive and enthusiastic in his humanitarian roles. His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair," he said. Mr Cameron, who chaired an emergency Cobra committee meeting on Sunday morning, said the murder of an innocent aid worker was "despicable and appalling". "It is an act of pure evil. My heart goes out to the family of David Haines who have shown extraordinary courage and fortitude throughout this ordeal. "We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes," the prime minister added. 'Grief and resolve' The Foreign Office is working to verify the video, which was released on Saturday night. It begins with a clip of Mr Cameron and then features a man who appears to be Mr Haines dressed in orange overalls, kneeling in front of a masked man holding a knife. The victim says: "My name is David Cawthorne Haines. I would like to declare that I hold you, David Cameron, entirely responsible for my execution." He says Mr Cameron had entered into a coalition with the US against the Islamic State "just as your predecessor Tony Blair did". "Unfortunately it is we the British public that in the end will pay the price for our parliament's selfish decisions," he said. The militant, who appears to have a British accent, is then recorded as saying: "This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the Peshmerga against the Islamic State." Islamic State is now in control of large parts of northern Iraq and Syria, and the CIA estimates that the group could have as many as 30,000 fighters in the region. The UK has donated heavy machine guns and ammunition to authorities in Iraq to help fight IS militants, the Ministry of Defence has previously said. Kurdish forces, known as the Peshmerga, have been involved in heavy fighting with IS. International condemnation Mr Haines's death has been condemned by international political leaders, including Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, French President Francois Hollande, Labour leader Ed Miliband and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond. US President Barack Obama said the US would work with the UK and other countries to "bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice". Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the government "will not rest" until Mr Haines's killers "face justice". Mr Alex Salmond said a resilience meeting - the Scottish government's version of the UK's Cobra security meeting - would be held on Sunday morning to discuss issues such as the privacy of Mr Haines's family. The leader of the Better Together campaign in Scotland, Alistair Darling, said Mr Haines's death "inexcusable, a barbaric act" that would "strengthen the resolve of the international community". Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said he would like to see the militant in the video "face justice in a British court - he's a British citizen and has been boasting of that". Analysis: Jim Muir, BBC News The beheadings of David Haines, and the two American journalists before him, are believed to have been filmed in the desert near Raqqa, a provincial capital in north-east Syria which has become the unofficial capital of the self-styled Islamic State. Far from being just a shadowy terror group, IS controls a large swathe of territory in the north and east of Syria, linked since June to almost all the mainly Sunni parts of Iraq. It controls a population of around 5 or 6 million people, including Iraq's second city, Mosul. In northern Iraq, the Kurds, helped by US air strikes, are slowly regaining the ground they lost to IS when it suddenly turned on them last month. That's the template the Americans and their allies want to apply to other parts of Iraq, and Syria, but the situation in both countries is complicated by the absence of clear-cut, cohesive local forces on the ground to work with. Elsewhere, religious leaders have also reacted to the killing, including the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who posted a call on Twitter for prayers for the family of Mr Haines, who was "evilly killed". Shuja Shafi of the Muslim Council of Britain said: "These extremists wish to draw attention and recruits to their cause by sowing division and fear between people here in Britain. Let us deny them that luxury." 'Criminals and villains' Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British forces in Afghanistan, said it was vital that Britain took some "serious action" against IS. "The key issue here is that we cannot rule out the use of large-scale ground forces. I don't mean the kind of thing that's happening now. I mean large-scale intervention forces," he told BBC Radio 5 live. Failure to do so would mean Britain would "just accept the fact that the Islamic State will continue to expand, continue to decapitate our citizens, continue to pose a threat to our country and countries in the region". But former military intelligence officer Frank Ledwidge said Britain "must be sober about this, and understand our national interests and equate what we do with those interests". He said IS's objective now is "to hold what it's got, and there's no better way of doing that than recruiting to it the millions of people in the area who'd be quite happy to fight yet another Western intervention in the area". Paul Rogers, professor of peace studies at Bradford University, said the UK's natural reaction would be to "go in hard" against IS, but that this presented a problem, because the extremists wanted to be attacked so as to "present itself as fighting the far enemy". Mr Rogers also said the "war" in the region was "at a much higher level than we suppose", with more than 2,000 sorties by the US in the last few weeks. The West was now moving into "what is essentially a third Iraq war" and that this time it would extend into Syria, he said. Mr Haines was taken hostage in the village of Atmeh, in the Idlib province of Syria, in March 2013. He had been helping French agency Acted deliver humanitarian aid, having previously helped local people in Libya and South Sudan. The release of the video came hours after his family made a direct appeal to IS to contact them. IS - also known as Isis or Isil - has seized large swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria and declared a new caliphate - or Islamic state. Militants from the extremist group have killed two US hostages in recent weeks, posting video evidence on the internet. They threatened to kill Mr Haines during a video posted online showing the killing of US journalist Steven Sotloff earlier this month. The extremist group also killed fellow US journalist James Foley last month.
He vowed to tackle the BBC's "meeting culture", which "hampers creativity". Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Lord Hall pledged to halve the number of pan-BBC boards and steering groups. He wrote: "This 'bonfire of the boards' should speed up decision-making and release some of the resources currently wasted on bureaucracy for programmes." He added: "A simpler BBC should mean a more creative BBC." In his five months as director general, Lord Hall has faced the fallout from the Jimmy Savile scandal, criticism over the size of management pay-offs and the collapse of the BBC's £98m Digital Media Initiative IT project. In his article, he said the BBC had a lot to learn from companies such as Google and Apple, which he visited on a recent trip to the US. "To launch an initiative, one of our colleagues at Google had to speak to two people," he wrote. "To get agreement to do the BBC's first ebook, someone at the BBC had to speak to more than two dozen." He hailed Silicon Valley's "fail fast culture", which meant it was "much better to kill off what had seemed like a good idea, and be upfront about it, than to work on, hoping it might come good". 'Failed idea' "At the BBC, we wasted nearly £100m on a computer project because no-one was prepared to call time on a failed idea," he wrote. The BBC must be "much clearer" on how decisions were made and who was accountable for them, he added. "We often spend far too long agonising over decisions that other organisations have learnt to make much more efficiently." In evidence to the Pollard Review of the Savile affair, BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten described the corporation's management culture as "dysfunctional" and "chaotic". Lord Hall also said he wanted to see more women on screen and in senior roles. The appointment of Mishal Husain to Radio 4's Today programme was "a good start", he wrote. The director general recently announced a plan to ensure half of all local radio breakfast shows have female presenters on their teams. He also pledged to recruit more people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds.
By Andrew BlackPolitical reporter, BBC Scotland He revealed the date as draft legislation on holding the vote was brought before the Scottish Parliament. Voters will be asked the yes/no question, "Should Scotland be an independent country?" The Scottish government said it was a historic day, but opposition parties accused the SNP of keeping voters in the dark for too long. Scots ministers previously only said the referendum would take place in autumn 2014. Announcing the date while speaking in the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, Mr Salmond said: "It's worth reflecting, just for a moment, on the privilege this nation and this generation will have - nothing less than choosing the future course of our country. "We have been on a journey since 1999, since the restoration of our parliament here in the heart of our ancient capital. We've witnessed a growing confidence, an increase in democratic accountability. "I'm honoured to announce that, on Thursday the 18th of September 2014, we will hold Scotland's referendum - a historic day when the people will decide Scotland's future." Scottish ministers - who will publish their substantive case for independence in a white paper later this year - said a "Yes" vote would allow Scotland to use its natural assets to build a better country. Scots opposition parties who support the Union - Labour, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, as well as the Westminster government - said Scotland was better off as part of the wider UK. Mr Salmond said: "People will be able to choose if they want a Scotland that is independent and able to make her own decisions - with a Scottish Parliament that is responsible for making the most of Scotland's rich resources to benefit its communities and safeguard the welfare of our most vulnerable citizens and accountable for how we engage other nations around the world." MSPs will need to approve the arrangements for the vote in the Scottish Independence Referendum Bill, although the SNP's parliamentary majority means the passage of the legislation is assured. The Scottish government said the bill would make sure that: Reacting to the date Johann Lamont, leader of Scottish Labour, said: "The truth is, Alex Salmond knows if he held the referendum now, he wouldn't just lose it, he would be routed. "All the self-aggrandizement of today isn't just a sign of the first minister's usual pomposity. "Making an occasion out of a delayed announcement is an attempt to con the people into believing that we have moved a step towards independence when we haven't." Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson welcomed the clarity provided by the date, adding: "I believe that, in September of next year, the people of Scotland will vote to stay within our United Kingdom. "Recognising that the autonomy the Scottish Parliament has in areas such as health, social care education and justice, allied with the strength of being part of a larger UK family, the safety and security of our intelligence services, the international standing from our diplomatic corps and the advantages of being one of the largest economies in the planet means Scotland can make a positive choice for devolution - the very best of both worlds - not opt for separation." Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, told MSPs: "I'm sure the first minister is excited by today's events, but after all the build up, this looks like one of those occasions where the trailer's more exciting than the movie. "It's taken the first minister almost 700 days to get the Cabinet to agree to the date of the referendum - why on earth does he think it will take him less time to break up the country?" Green MSP Patrick Harvie, whose party supports independence, said: "Now we have the date for our diaries, the effort to persuade those who are undecided must focus on the needs of real people and not just those with loud voices and deep pockets." Independent member Margo MacDonald, who also backs a "Yes" vote in 2014, said the level of debate must now be raised, telling the parliament: "This is about a country's soul - it's about your children and your grandchildren's standards and place in the world." For the UK government, Scottish secretary Michael Moore welcomed news of the date, adding: "The debate about Scotland's future has already begun and will only intensify, and that is something I look forward to. "I am confident when Scots go to the polls they will vote in favour of Scotland staying within a strong and secure UK family." A special Scottish Parliament cross-party committee is to begin scrutinising the referendum legislation, and has asked interested individuals and organisations to submit their views. The Scottish government has already introduced separate draft legislation to allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in the ballot.
By Callistasia Wijaya and Rebecca HenschkeBBC News Indonesia Sepri had never been to sea before, when he heard through a friend about the chance to work on a Chinese-owned fishing boat. The promised money on offer was beyond anything the 25-year-old could dream of earning in his village on the Indonesian island of Sumatra. "He was so enthusiastic about suddenly being able to earn such big money for us," his sister Rika Andri Pratama remembers. With the assurance of training and a $400 (£326) a month salary, he set sail with a group of 22 Indonesian men on the Long Xing 629 fishing vessel in February last year. "Before he left, he borrowed some money from me," says Rika. "He said it would be the last time because he would come home with loads more and we could finally afford to renovate the family home." But Sepri never came home. No money was sent. And Rika didn't speak to her brother again. In early January, she received a letter. He had died at sea, his body thrown overboard into the Pacific Ocean. "My heart was crushed when I heard he was thrown into the sea," she says holding back tears. She was filled with guilt. "Before our mum died, her last words were, 'you should take care of your little brother'." Two other Indonesian crew members died on the Long Xing 629. Sepri and another man died within days of each other in December, after just 10 months at sea. While Ari, who was from the same village as Sepri, died in March this year, shortly before the rest of the crew were rescued. Like Sepri, their bodies were wrapped in cloth and thrown over the side. Like Sepri's, their families would never get the chance to say goodbye either. A third desperately ill man, Efendi Pasaribu, would make it to shore alive - but only just. There was a chance this could have all gone unnoticed - simply a few more deaths at sea - had the unceremonious sea burial captured on a mobile not come to light, and caused a public outcry in Indonesia. Instead, the video sparked a renewed debate about the abuse of fishermen aboard foreign vessels in Southeast Asia. Shockingly, the stories of life aboard the Long Xing 629 are eerily familiar, and come just five years after about 4,000 foreign fishermen, mostly from Myanmar (Burma), were rescued and freed from remote islands in Indonesia; some had been exploited in slave-like conditions for years. At the time Indonesia vowed to fight to end unregulated fishing and the exploitation of fishermen on foreign vessels. As the Long Xing 629's survivors began to talk, it became clear little had changed. 'All we could do was wash them and pray' Fellow crew mates, who requested only to be identified by their initials, said they were often beaten and kicked. They couldn't understand what their Chinese bosses were saying and it led to confusion and frustration. One of the crew told BBC Indonesia his friends' bodies all swelled up before they died. Another said they were forced to work 18-hour days and only given fish bait to eat. "They [the Chinese crew] drank mineral water, while we were only given poorly distilled sea water," 20-year-old NA said. When it became clear how sick Sepri and the others had become, NA says they pleaded with the captain to bring them to land for treatment. After the three men died, the crew begged to keep the bodies in a cooler so their friends could be buried in line with their Islamic customs once they reached the shore. But the captain told them that no one would want them. "He argued that every country would reject their bodies anyway," NA says. "All we could do was wash their bodies according to the Islamic law, pray and then throw them in to the sea." The captain finally agreed to move the remaining Indonesian crew members to another Chinese vessel which landed in Busan, South Korea. Efendi Pasaribu was still critically ill, but he was alive. 'Leaving for a better future' His mother, Kelentina Silaban, was able to video call her son while he lay in a hospital bed in Busan. Efendi was almost unrecognisable from the healthy 21-year-old who had said goodbye to her just over a year ago. "I said please, please just come home, we will take care of you in the village." Instead, her son's body was returned to her. They were told he had died from kidney failure and pneumonia. Before he left his village he had posted a photo of himself on social media, proudly pulling a suitcase, with the caption: "I am leaving in order to carve out a better future." Efendi ended up being buried close to the family home in rural Sumatra. "We hope that our brother's death helps uncover the slavery on foreign fishing vessels. We are hoping that this will be fully investigated," said his brother Rohman. Answers - not money Migrant rights groups are calling on the government to do much more to protect their citizens from becoming "slaves". The Indonesian government says the Long Xing 269 survivors - none of whom received their full salaries - were part of a group of 49 fishermen, ranging from 19 to 24, who had been forced to work in poor conditions on at least four fishing boats owned by the same Chinese company, Dalian Ocean fishing Co Ltd. It declined to respond to the allegations when contacted by the BBC, saying it would issue a statement on its website. No response has been released. Both countries are promising the families answers. Jakarta described the sailors' treatment as "inhumane", while the Chinese embassy in Jakarta described it as an "unfortunate incident". It has said that they are now carrying out a "comprehensive investigation" in partnership with Indonesia. In Indonesia, three men have been arrested as part of the investigation into the recruitment firms that hired the young men. They could face up to 15 years in jail if found guilty under human trafficking laws. "We will ensure that the company has to fulfil our crews' rights," Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said in a video conference. "Based on the information from the crews, the company has violated human rights," she added. The Indonesian fisherman agency association (IFMA) told BBC Indonesia that there are numerous unregistered agencies hiring crews with no oversight from the government. "There are so many requests from foreign vessels, these agencies just make the needed documents and send the men on on their way. There is no filter from the Indonesia side," said the group's vice president Tikno. In response to public pressure, the government says they are now considering putting in place a six-month moratorium on Indonesian fishermen going to work on foreign vessels. "This would allow us to have time to improve our oversight, so we can put in place a one-channel system where we have all the data we need to be able to monitor and make sure the rights of our fishermen are protected," fisheries ministry official Zulficar Mochtar said. Meanwhile, the recruitment firm who hired Rika's brother, Sepri, has promised to pay her 250 million rupiah (£13,000) in compensation. But she wants answers, not just money. "We need to know what happened on that vessel," she said. "Let us be the last family which has to experience this." Additional reporting by BBC Indonesia's Affan Hedyer and Raja Eben Lumbanrau
Crimea's leader says he will apply to join Russia on Monday. Russia's Vladimir Putin has said he will respect the Crimean people's wishes. Many Crimeans loyal to Kiev boycotted the referendum, and the EU and US condemned it as illegal. Pro-Russian forces took control of Crimea in February. They moved in after Ukraine's pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted after street protests. Mr Putin and US President Barack Obama spoke over the phone earlier, with the Kremlin and the White House later releasing contrasting accounts of the conversation. The Kremlin said both men agreed to seek a way to stabilise Ukraine, and that Mr Putin had stressed that the Kiev government had failed to curb "rampant violence by ultra-nationalists". The White House said Mr Obama had insisted that the referendum was illegal and would never be accepted, and called for Moscow to support an international monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine. The EU said in a statement that the vote was "illegal and illegitimate and its outcome will not be recognised". EU foreign ministers are due to meet on Monday and are expected to consider imposing sanctions on Russian officials. Sergei Aksyonov, Crimea's leader installed last month after the Russian takeover, celebrated the referendum on stage in Simferopol. Backed by the Russian national anthem, Russian flags, and the personnel of Russia's Black Sea fleet, he told supporters that Crimea was "going home". Mr Aksyonov said Crimea's parliament, which was disbanded by the government in Kiev last week, would send a formal request to Moscow to join Russia on Monday. Some 58% of people in Crimea are ethnic Russian, with the rest made up of Ukrainians and Tatars. Most of the Tatars that the BBC spoke to said they had boycotted the vote, and felt that life under the Kremlin would be worse. Refat Chubarov, leader of the Tatars' unofficial parliament, said the referendum was illegal, and held in a hasty manner under the control of Russian troops. "The fate of our motherland cannot be decided in such a referendum under the shadows of the guns of soldiers," he told the BBC. The Tatars were deported to Central Asia by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. They were only able to return with the fall of the Soviet Union and many want to remain in Ukraine. But the referendum did not have an option for those who wanted the constitutional arrangements to remain unchanged. Voters were asked whether they wanted to join Russia, or have greater autonomy within Ukraine. Away from the Crimea region, unrest continued in the south-east Ukrainian city of Donetsk. Pro-Russian protesters stormed the prosecutor's building shouting "Donetsk is a Russian city", and then broke into the local security services headquarters for the second time in two days. They later dispersed but promised to return on Monday.
By Simon ReadBusiness reporter The average UK house price reached a record high of £252,000 in December 2020, the Office for National Statistics said. The North West had the highest growth of 11.2%, while London rose just 3.5%. The stamp duty holiday due to end this March contributed to the rise, the ONS said. Spending more time at home in the pandemic meant some people also decided they needed more space. That was reflected in the average price of detached properties climbing by twice as much as flats and maisonettes during 2020, up 10% and 5% respectively. Meanwhile Wales experienced the fastest price growth, with property values rising 10.7% to £184,000. In England, prices climbed 8.5% to £269,000, in Scotland, 8.4% to £163,000 and in Northern Ireland 5.3% to £148,000. "Recent price increases may reflect a range of factors including pent-up demand, some possible changes in housing preferences since the pandemic and a response to the changes made to property transaction taxes across the nations," the ONS said. Regional variations The UK housing market is made up of lots of local markets, with different factors affecting property prices such as the performance of schools and the availability of jobs. The ONS figures are based on sale completions. Although average London prices were up by 3.5%, over last year, prices fell in the capital by £5,000 between November and December, despite a UK-wide price increase of 1.2% over the month. But the city still has the highest average house price in the UK, at £496,000. The North East continued to have the lowest average house price at £141,000, and has become the final English region to surpass its pre-economic downturn peak of July 2007. Cheap debt "2020 was the year that fundamentals came home to roost," said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country. "There was no escaping a lack of space for households who suddenly found they were living on top of each other with little respite. That has powered annual growth that reached a six-year high." There were four major drivers of overall house price rises in 2020, said Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital. "The temporary stamp duty reduction and cheap debt as a result of very low interest rates, which give buyers a 'discount'; the release of pent-up supply and demand and desire to improve surroundings amongst existing homeowners; and the 'flight to safety', since in times of uncertainty, people want to keep their money in a stable asset with low volatility. "But looking to the future when the temporary stamp duty reduction ends, we're likely to see a slowdown in house price rises," she said. "However, there is still some life in the market as lockdown helps to concentrate many potential buyers and sellers' minds as far as moving is concerned," said north London estate agent Jeremy Leaf. "Intense speculation remains as to whether the 31 March stamp duty deadline will be extended and we can't help but have sympathy for many who have started the process several months ago who have been unavoidably delayed by a backlog in searches, surveys, conveyancing, or all three, to say nothing of problems in the new-build industry."
Rodman said Mr Kim, who was in the audience with his wife and other senior officials, was his "best friend". The former NBA star is on his fourth North Korean visit to mark Mr Kim's birthday with a basketball match. He has angrily defended his visit after criticism from rights groups. The US said he does not represent the country. The crowd of about 14,000 at the Pyongyang Indoor Stadium clapped and waved as Rodman sang Happy Birthday on Wednesday, the Associated Press news agency says. Rodman is with a team of former National Basketball Association (NBA) players who played an exhibition match. He said the match was to celebrate Kim Jong-un's birthday, although the leader's official birthday and age have not been confirmed. The celebration comes weeks after the execution of Mr Kim's uncle, Chang Song-thaek, once seen as a major power in North Korea. His rapid and brutal purge has sparked concern over stability inside the country. Meanwhile, state news agency KCNA has announced that elections for North Korea's rubber-stamp parliament will be held on 9 March - an event which could provide a hint of who the key players are in the wake of Mr Chang's execution. 'Take the abuse' Dennis Rodman has said that he was on a "basketball diplomacy" mission in North Korea. He remains the highest-profile American to have met the young Mr Kim. Rodman had been asked several times in the past whether he could use his relationship with Mr Kim to discuss Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American sentenced to 15 years' hard labour in May 2013. North Korea said that Mr Bae - described as both a tour operator and Christian missionary - had used his tourism business to plot sedition. Asked again in a CNN interview on Tuesday, Rodman appeared to lose his cool, saying: "If you understand what Kenneth Bae did... Do you understand what he did in this country? ... I would love to speak on this." His visit was about opening "the door a little bit", he said, even though the team would have "to go back to America and take the abuse". A White House spokesman declined to comment on Rodman's remarks, but reiterated a call for North Korea to release Mr Bae - who is suffering from ill health - on humanitarian grounds. Mr Bae's sister described Rodman's comments as appalling and said she was concerned they would hurt efforts to free her brother. "Clearly, he's uninformed and doesn't know anything about Kenneth or his detainment. I don't think he has any authority to speak or pass judgment on Kenneth," Terri Chung told US media. "This isn't some game. This is about a person's life," she said, adding her family had attempted to reach Rodman in the past without success. Another player, former NBA star Charles D Smith, meanwhile, told the Associated Press news agency that he felt "remorse" for participating in the trip amid the backlash in the US. "I feel a lot of remorse for the guys because we are doing something positive, but it's a lot bigger than us. We are not naive, we understand why things are being portrayed the way they are."
The koala, dubbed Lewis, had been taken to an animal hospital last week after a woman plucked him from a tree in burning bushland in New South Wales. Video of the rescue - which shows Toni Doherty using her shirt to wrap up the koala - was viewed globally. Vets said the marsupial was put down because his burns were not improving. "[Our] number one goal is animal welfare, so it was on those grounds that this decision was made," said Port Macquarie Koala Hospital. Six people have died and more than 500 homes have been lost since a bushfire crisis began ravaging Australia in September. 'It was just so heart-rending' In the video, Ms Doherty is seen pouring water over the distressed animal in an attempt to cool it. She told local news outlets she had been driving through the forest when she spotted the koala among the flames and heard its cries. "I didn't realise they could cry out. It was just so heart-rending and I knew I needed to get him out of there as quickly as possible," Ms Doherty told Nine News. The 14-year-old koala had significant burns to its chest, feet and other parts of its body, vets said. The hospital has treated dozens of koalas injured from the bushfires which have burnt through more than a million hectares in New South Wales alone. The blazes continue to burn and officials warn that the worst of Australia's season is still to come.
By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News The spoof awards that have become almost as famous as the real Nobels were handed out at their annual ceremony at Harvard University, US. Kiyoshi Mabuchi's Japanese team measured the friction of banana skin in the lab, and showed why apple and orange peel are not quite so hazardous. The Kitasato University group received the physics Ig for their insights. It is another classic of its type. The awards, which are run by the science humour magazine Annals of Improbable Research, can seem quite ridiculous at first. But when you delve deeper, you often see a serious intention beyond just the tongue in cheek. The Japanese scientists are interested in how friction and lubrication affect the movement of our limbs. The polysaccharide follicular gels that give banana skins their slippery properties are also found in the membranes where our bones meet. "This concept will help to design a joint prosthesis," Kiyoshi Mabuchi told BBC News. Another winner this year was the study that examined the brains of people who see the face of Jesus and other figures in slices of toast. The work won the neuroscience Ig. Kang Lee, from the University of Toronto, Canada, and colleagues showed their subjects pictures of "noise" - like the random speckles you used to get on old, out-of-tune TVs - to see what patterns the volunteers would identify. This tendency to see order in randomness - like a face in the charred areas of a piece of bread - is a well-established phenomenon called pareidolia. Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Lee and his team saw how the same parts of the brain light up when we see non-existent faces as when we see real ones. "Interestingly, when you superimpose all the noise images where these people say they see faces, and subtract all the noise images in which they told us they couldn't see faces - when we do this type of image processing, a face does actually show up," Prof Lee said. The Toronto scientist explained that this type of pattern recognition was hard-wired, and even chimps experienced it. "The face you are going to see is determined by your personal expectations or beliefs," he added. "So, for example, Buddhists might not see Jesus on toast, but they might see a Buddha on toast." This is the 24th year of the Ig Nobels, and they just get bigger and bigger. Marc Abrahams, the editor of Annals of Improbable Research, said scientists were clearly now doing studies with an eye to winning an Ig. "We're getting about 9,000 nominations a year. About 10% to 20% are self-nominations, but these entries hardly ever win," he told BBC News. "That's generally because they are just trying to be funny. Whereas, those who win perhaps don't start out that way, and only realise later on that what they are up to really is kind of funny." The full list of winners this year: PHYSICS: Kiyoshi Mabuchi, of Kitasato University, Japan, and colleagues, for measuring the amount of friction between a shoe and a banana skin, and between a banana skin and the floor, when a person steps on a banana skin that's on the floor. NEUROSCIENCE: Kang Lee, of the University of Toronto, Canada, and colleagues for trying to understand what happens in the brains of people who see the face of Jesus in a piece of toast. PSYCHOLOGY: Peter Jonason, of the University of Western Sydney, Australia, and colleagues for amassing evidence that people who habitually stay up late are, on average, more self-admiring, more manipulative, and more psychopathic than people who habitually arise early in the morning. PUBLIC HEALTH: Jaroslav Flegr, of Charles University, Czech Republic, and colleagues for investigating whether it is mentally hazardous for a human being to own a cat. BIOLOGY: Vlastimil Hart, of the Czech University of Life Sciences, and colleagues for carefully documenting that when dogs defecate and urinate, they prefer to align their body axis with Earth's north-south geomagnetic field lines. ART: Marina de Tommaso, of the University of Bari, Italy, and colleagues for measuring the relative pain people suffer while looking at an ugly painting, rather than a pretty painting, while being shot [in the hand] by a powerful laser beam. ECONOMICS: The Italian government's National Institute of Statistics, for proudly taking the lead in fulfilling the European Union mandate for each country to increase the official size of its national economy by including revenues from prostitution, illegal drug sales, smuggling, and all other unlawful financial transactions between willing participants. MEDICINE: Ian Humphreys, of Michigan State University, US, and colleagues, for treating "uncontrollable" nosebleeds, using the method of nasal-packing-with-strips-of-cured-pork. ARCTIC SCIENCE: Eigil Reimers, of the University of Oslo, Norway, and colleagues, for testing how reindeer react to seeing humans who are disguised as polar bears. NUTRITION: Raquel Rubio, of IRTA, Spain, and colleagues, for their study titled "Characterization of Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated from Infant Faeces as Potential Probiotic Starter Cultures for Fermented Sausages."

Hall, 84, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, will start the sentence after completing a 30-month term for similar offences. He admitted indecently assaulting the girl when she was 13 and was found guilty of one count in a majority jury verdict at Preston Crown Court. He was cleared of 15 rape charges and four indecent assaults. The charge Hall admitted involved an incident at a dinner party where he crept into his victim's bedroom and assaulted her. 'Vile bravado' Sentencing him, Mr Justice Turner, said there had been "an element of grooming" to his offences. Mr Justice Turner said there had been a "breach of trust" in relation to the assault on the girl when she was 13. He said that Hall had acted with "a sense of arrogance and immunity... vile bravado and horrible betrayal". He added that the 84-year-old had shown "a lack of candour or remorse" and criticised him for not admitting to these offences when he was convicted of other offences in 2013. Hall did not react to the sentence as he listened to the proceedings through headphones, while his victim, who was also in court, wiped away tears with a handkerchief as details of the offences were mentioned. The former broadcaster, who was accused of abusing two girls between 1976 and 1981, is already serving a 30-month jail term after he pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting 13 other girls, one as young as nine. His original 15-month sentence, for abuse that occurred between 1967 and 1985, was later doubled at the Court of Appeal. Speaking after the hearing, the Chief Crown Prosecutor for the North West, Nazir Afzal, said Hall's convictions "were only made possible by the courage of his victims". "I would like to thank them for coming forward and ensuring that he was brought to justice," he said.
By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter Data is like oil to Facebook - it is what brings advertisers to the platform, who in turn make it money. And there is no question that Facebook has the ability to build detailed and sophisticated profiles on users' likes, dislikes, lifestyles and political leanings. The bigger question becomes - what does it share with others and what can users do to regain control of their information? Want to see what you look like as a Hollywood star? Click here. We've all seen these quizzes - offering to test your IQ, reveal your inner personality, or show you what you'd look like if you were a glamorous actor. It was information from one such Facebook quiz - This is Your Digital Life - that Cambridge Analytica is alleged to have used to harvest the data of millions of people. Many such quizzes come with reassurances that your data is safe. These games and quizzes are designed to tempt users in but they are often just a shop front for mass data collection - and one that Facebook's terms and conditions allow. Privacy advocates Electronic Frontier Foundation said the way these quizzes collected data reflected "how Facebook's terms of service and API were structured at the time". Facebook has changed its terms and conditions to cut down on the information that third parties can collect, specifically stopping them from accessing data about users' friends. It is not yet clear exactly what information the firm got hold of - this is now subject to an investigation by the UK data protection authority, the ICO. What can users do to protect their information? This will mean that you won't be able to use third-party sites on Facebook and if that is is a step too far, there is a way of limiting the personal information accessible by apps while still using them: There are some others pieces of advice too. "Never click on a 'like' button on a product service page and if you want to play these games and quizzes, don't log in through Facebook but go directly to the site," said Paul Bernal, a lecturer in Information Technology, Intellectual Property and Media Law in the University of East Anglia School of Law. "Using Facebook Login is easy but doing so, grants the app's developer access to a range of information from their Facebook profiles," he added. How else can you protect your Facebook data? There really is only one way to make sure data we create on a daily basis remains entirely private, thinks Dr Bernal. "Leave Facebook." "The incentive Facebook will have to protect people more will only come if people start leaving. Currently it has very little incentive to change," he told the BBC. It seems he is not alone in his call - the hashtag #DeleteFacebook is now trending on Twitter in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. But Dr Bernal acknowledges that it is unlikely many will quit - especially those who see Facebook as "part of the infrastructure of their lives". The less drastic option is deactivation, which stops an account from appearing in search results but gives the user the option to bring it back. It would stop future tracking but means all the information already collected will still be kept. For those that decide deletion is the best option, users can head to the delete my account page, which explains that once gone, information cannot be retrieved. The page is not easy to find on the site and requires quite a few steps: Facebook advises users who delete their account to download a copy of their information before they delete it. They also warn users that the process can take up to 90 days, during which time the information is inaccessible to others using the platform. Can you find out what data on you is stored? Under current data protection rules, users can make a Subject Access Request to individual firms to find out how much information they have on them. When Austrian privacy advocate Max Schrems made such a request to Facebook in 2011, he was given a CD with 1,200 files stored on it. He found that the social network kept records of all the IP addresses of machines he used to access the site, a full history of messages and chats, his location and even items that he thought he had deleted, such as messages, status updates and wall posts. But in a world where Facebook information is shared more widely with third parties, making such a request gets harder. As Dr Bernal says: "How do you ask for your data when you don't know who to ask?" That is likely to change this summer with the introduction of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which aims to make it far easier for users to take back control of their data. The threat of big fines for firms that do not comply with such requests could make it more likely that they will share this information, which must be given to consumers "in a clear and readable form". How long is data kept? Data protection laws in Europe suggest that firms should only keep user data "as long as necessary" but the interpretation of this can be very flexible. In Facebook's case, this means that as long as the person posting something does not delete it, it will remain online indefinitely. Can you delete historic data?

It was her first address to the country about the violence in northern Rakhine state that has seen more than 400,000 Rohingya Muslims cross into Bangladesh. Ms Suu Kyi has faced heavy criticism for her response to the crisis. She said there had been no "clearance operations" for two weeks. In her speech in English to Myanmar's parliament, Aung San Suu Kyi said she felt "deeply" for the suffering of "all people" in the conflict, and that Myanmar was "committed to a sustainable solution… for all communities in this state". Ms Suu Kyi, who has decided not to attend the UN General Assembly in New York later this week, said she nevertheless wanted the international community to know what was being done by her government. Hours after her speech, the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva called for full access to the region so it can investigate the situation "with its own eyes". What is the crisis about? Rakhine has faced unrest and sporadic violence for years, but the current crisis began in August with an armed attack on police posts which killed 12 people. That was blamed on a newly emerged militant group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (Arsa). The Rohingya, a mostly Muslim minority, are denied citizenship and equal opportunities by the Myanmar government, which says they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. They are largely despised by the wider Burmese majority-Buddhist population. The attack led to a massive security crackdown by the military, which the UN's human rights chief later said seemed like a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing". Rohingya Muslims started leaving in vast numbers, crossing into Bangladesh with tales of their villages being burned and saying they were facing persecution at the hands of the military. Thousands of Rohingya had already fled to Bangladesh in recent years. Access is restricted to the area, but on a government-controlled trip for journalists the BBC found reason to question the official narrative that Muslims were setting fire to their own villages. What did Suu Kyi say in her speech? The Myanmar government does not use the term Rohingya - calling the group Bengali Muslims instead - and Ms Suu Kyi did not do so in her speech. Delivering her address in a tone of measured defiance, she said she and her government "condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence". Among the key points: How was the speech received? Ms Suu Kyi has overwhelming support in her home country, where she was a political prisoner for years before coming to power. But her speech has been criticised internationally for failing to address the allegations of abuse by the military. The BBC's Jonathan Head, who is in neighbouring Bangladesh, disputed the claim that there had been no clearance operations since 5 September, pointing out that he had seen villages being burned days after that date. Amnesty International said Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi was "burying her head in the sand" by ignoring the abuses by the army. "At times, her speech amounted to little more than a mix of untruths and victim blaming," the rights group's director for South East Asia and the Pacific, James Gomes, said in a statement. Blind to the realities? By Jonah Fisher, BBC News, Nay Pyi Taw Aung San Suu Kyi is either completely out of touch or wilfully blind to the realities of what her army is up to. It is simply not credible to say we don't know why more than 400,000 Rohingya have fled. The evidence is being gathered every day in the testimony of refugees. There were other moments that raised eyebrows. Like when she presented as good news the fact that more than half the Muslims in Rakhine haven't fled. Or when she said that there had been no clashes in Rakhine for the last two weeks. To say as she did that "all people in Rakhine state have access to education and healthcare without discrimination" is simply wrong. The Rohingya, particularly those in camps around Sittwe, have long been denied access to the most basic services, in particular healthcare. What is Myanmar's position? While Ms Suu Kyi is the de facto head of the government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, it is the military which holds real power in Rakhine state as it is in charge of internal security. The Burmese military says its operations in the northern Rakhine state are aimed at rooting out militants, and has repeatedly denied targeting civilians. Ms Suu Kyi has previously said the narrative was being distorted by a "huge iceberg of misinformation" and said tensions were being fanned by fake news promoting the interests of terrorist.
By Mark SavageBBC Music reporter Mars provided the night's big upset, taking the album of the year trophy that most critics assumed would go to Lamar's rap tour de force, Damn. In the end, voters found Mars's crowd-pleasing R&B more palatable, while Lamar dominated the rap categories. Alessia Cara won best new artist - making her the only female artist to win a major prize. Stars like Lady Gaga, Kesha, Lorde and SZA were overlooked, with only 17 awards (out of a total of 86) going to women or female-fronted bands. The imbalance was particularly incongruous on a night that highlighted the #TimesUp and #MeToo campaigns. Most performers arrived for the show wearing a white rose to symbolise their support for the movements, which tackle sexual harassment and inequality. Pop star Kesha also gave a powerful, stirring performance of her single Praying, which addresses her own experience of surviving abuse. She was backed by an all-star choir, including Cyndi Lauper and Camila Cabello, who were dressed in white to reflect the white rose campaign. "We come in peace but we mean business," said R&B star Janelle Monae, introducing the performance. "To those who would dare try to silence us, we offer two words: Time's Up. "We say Time's Up for pay inequality, discrimination or harassment of any kind, and the abuse of power." "Let's work together, women and men, as a united music industry committed to creating more safe work environments, equal pay, and access for all women." The night's other pivotal moment was a tribute to the music-loving victims of the tragedies in Manchester and Las Vegas. Handwritten notes bearing the names of the dead were projected on the stage as country music stars Maren Morris, Eric Church and Brothers Osborne performed Eric Clapton's Tears In Heaven. All three acts played at the Route 91 festival last October before a gunman opened fire on the audience, killing 58. "All of country music was reminded in the most tragic way the connection we share with fans and the loving power that music will always provide," said Eric Church, choking back tears. "We wanted to come together and honour the memory of the beautiful, music-loving souls so cruelly taken from us," added Morris. Grammys 2018 - key winners Album of the year: Bruno Mars - 24K Magic Record of the year: Bruno Mars - 24K Magic Song of the year: Bruno Mars - That's What I Like Best new artist: Alessia Cara Best pop album: Ed Sheeran - ÷ (Divide) Best rock album: The War On Drugs - A Deeper Understanding Best R&B album: Bruno Mars - 24k Magic Best rap album: Kendrick Lamar - Damn Mars left with six trophies in all, including the three biggest prizes: Album of the year, song of the year and record of the year. Speaking onstage, he paid tribute to his fellow nominees, saying: "You guys are the reason why I'm in the studio pulling my hair out". He also told the story of how, as a 15-year-old in Hawaii, he performed in a show called The Magic of Polynesia, singing songs by R&B writers Babyface, Jam & Lewis and Teddy Riley. "I'll be honest, I was incredible at 15," he laughed, before explaining how he'd wanted to recapture the sounds of those 80s and 90s hits on his latest album. "Those songs were written with nothing but joy... and that's all I wanted to bring with this album. Hopefully I could feel that again and see everybody dancing and everybody moving." As well as the star's own prizes, his recording engineers won a further award for their work on the album. His victory robbed Kendrick Lamar's more urgent, political album of the night's main prizes - but the Compton-born star still took home five trophies, including best rap album, best rap song and best rap performance. He also opened the ceremony, in New York's Madison Square Gardens, with a provocative, politically-charged performance that featured contributions from U2 and Dave Chapelle. "I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America," observed Chapelle in the middle of the segment. Lamar's victories came at the expense of rap veteran Jay-Z and his soul-baring album 4:44. Jay-Z won none of his eight nominations and chose not to perform at the three-hour show. But Lamar tipped his hat to the elder star, declaring "Jay for president!" as he collected the best rap album award. The night also saw performances from Lady Gaga, Sam Smith, Pink and Patti LuPone, who sang Evita's Don't Cry For Me Argentina as part of a tribute to Andrew Lloyd Webber. Ed Sheeran, who could not attend the ceremony, won two prizes - best pop vocal performance for Shape Of You and best pop album for Divide. There were also posthumous awards for Leonard Cohen and actress Carrie Fisher, who won best spoken word album for the audio version of her memoirs, The Princess Diarist.

Interior Minister Constantinos Petrides did not name the individuals involved. Reports say they include nine Russians, eight Cambodians and five Chinese. The EU says such schemes may mask fraud. Cyprus offers an EU passport for an investment of at least €2m (£1.7m). Malta and Bulgaria have similar schemes, now under EU scrutiny. Mr Petrides said "mistakes" had been made in processing some citizenship requests. "It was a mistake not to have criteria, for instance, for high-risk persons," he said. The other non-EU individuals among the 26 are reported to be from Malaysia, Kenya and Iran. In January the EU told member states to tighten checks on non-EU nationals seeking passports via investments. There is concern that the so-called "golden passports" may be a backdoor into the EU for criminal gangs or government officials to launder huge sums, or evade tax. Cyprus joined the EU in 2004. EU citizens can move easily throughout the 28-nation bloc, as well as live and work in another member state without the bureaucratic hurdles that non-EU nationals face. Other EU states including the UK offer "golden" residence visas in exchange for large investments. Wealthy suspects Mr Petrides said the decision to revoke 26 individuals' Cypriot passports stemmed from the examination of nine investment cases. He told the BBC that "we're looking at cases of naturalisation before 2018". "This is according to guidelines from the EU, that when the criteria change, there should be second checks." This year Cyprus introduced 11 categories of "high-risk individuals excluded from applying", Mr Petrides said. One category is "politically exposed persons (PEPs)" - that is, any holder of public office. PEPs are considered a corruption risk because of their prominence and influence. Cyprus also now excludes: anyone previously convicted or under investigation in their own country; anyone linked to an illegal entity; or anyone under international sanctions. The second checks involve about 2,000 Cyprus passport-holders, Mr Petrides said. The biggest groups of applicants are Russians and Chinese. The Malaysian is suspected to be businessman Jho Low, wanted in connection with a massive state investment scandal. On Tuesday, Cypriot newspaper Politis reported that he had acquired a Cypriot passport. Jho Low is a central figure in the 1MDB case - a global scandal that saw billions of dollars go missing from a Malaysian state fund. His whereabouts are not known. He has denied any wrongdoing. The Financial Times says he bought a €5m property in the Cypriot resort of Ayia Napa in 2015, according to an invoice seen by the FT. Last month the US Department of Justice struck a deal to recover more than $700m ($544m) in assets, including luxury US properties, allegedly acquired by Mr Low and his family. There was no admission of wrongdoing by him. Russia and Cambodia Russian government daily Rossiiskaya Gazeta, meanwhile, reports that billionaire Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska has also applied for a Cypriot passport. He is among senior Russian state officials and oligarchs blacklisted in the US for "advancing Russia's malign activities". The US Treasury says the industrialist has been investigated for money-laundering and some other alleged crimes. A Deripaska representative quoted by Rossiiskaya Gazeta said Cypriot citizenship would help Mr Deripaska's "broad range of business interests... which require constant travel worldwide". Cyprus launched its "golden passport" scheme to help its recovery from the 2013 financial crisis, when an EU bailout was organised for troubled Cypriot banks. The scheme has resulted in nearly 4,000 non-EU nationals getting Cypriot passports - investors and family members - and about €6bn in earnings for Cyprus. An investigation by Reuters news agency last month linked Cyprus to close associates and relatives of Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been in power since 1985. It listed wealthy Cambodian individuals who, it alleged, had benefited from the Cypriot citizenship scheme, including Hun Sen's niece Hun Kimleng and her husband - Cambodia's police chief Neth Savoeun. Hun Sen's security forces are accused of systematic persecution of political opponents.
By Dr Alex VinesChatham House The news that General Constantino Chiwenga had visited China only a few days before the military takeover in Zimbabwe was a coincidence that did not go unnoticed. There was also speculation after China said it was closely watching developments, but stopped short of condemning President Mugabe's apparent removal from power. China is Zimbabwe's fourth largest trading partner and its largest source of investment - with stakes worth many billions of pounds in everything from agriculture to construction. Zimbabwe is the dependent partner - with China providing the largest market for its exports and much needed support to its fragile economy. China's relations with Zimbabwe are deep, starting during the Rhodesian Bush War. Robert Mugabe failed in 1979 to get Soviet backing, so turned to China, which provided his guerrilla fighters with weapons and training. Both countries formally established diplomatic relations at Zimbabwean independence in 1980 and Robert Mugabe visited Beijing as prime minister the following year. He has been a regular visitor since. For years, Zimbabwe's officials have tried to play off China against the West, advocating the country's "Look East" strategy, particularly following the introduction of EU sanctions in 2002. Indeed, a decade ago, Mr Mugabe told a packed rally at the Chinese-built national sports stadium in Harare: 'We have turned east, where the sun rises, and given our back to the west, where the sun sets." China's military engagement also deepened during Zimbabwe's "Look East" era. Significant purchases were made, including Hongdu JL-8 jet aircraft, JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft, vehicles, radar and weapons. However, following a controversy about a shipment of arms in 2008, Beijing decided to list Zimbabwe for "limited level" military trading. Despite Zimbabwe's efforts, the "Look East" strategy did not bring the investment flood hoped for and a decade later, in August 2015, Mr Mugabe openly asked for Western re-engagement in his "state of the nation" address. Now, the reality is that increasingly Chinese and Western interests - particularly those of the UK - have become aligned. Not far from each other in the outer suburbs of Harare, two of the biggest embassies in Zimbabwe are the British and the Chinese. As other embassies scaled down or closed, Beijing's expanded. Whereas British diplomats were well connected with business, civil society and opposition figures, the Chinese invested in "technical support" of the party of government Zanu-PF, including state security and the presidency. When it came to Zanu-PF politics and factionalism, Chinese diplomats were well connected and insightful and, like their Western colleagues, concerned about stability, a better investment climate and adherence to the rule of law. President Xi Jinping visited Zimbabwe in 2015 and President Mugabe visited Beijing in January 2017. In public, the Chinese leader said his country is willing to encourage capable companies to invest in Zimbabwe. But in private, the message was that there would be no more loans until Zimbabwe stabilised its economy. In 2016 trade between the two countries amounted to $1.1bn (£0.8bn), with China the biggest buyer of Zimbabwean tobacco and also importing cotton and various minerals. In return Zimbabwe imported electronics, clothing and other finished products. Chinese state construction firms have also been active, building infrastructure including Zimbabwe's $100m (£75m) National Defence College. And last year China agreed to finance a new 650-seat parliament in Harare. But Chinese diplomats and many businesses are waiting for better days in Zimbabwe. Some companies have found the investment climate challenging - being burned on diamonds, for example - and have looked for alternative markets. A couple of weeks ago I was in China, attending a meeting on China-Africa relations and Zimbabwe was not mentioned once. Unlike Ethiopia, Sudan, or Angola that are strategic partners, or big markets like Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, Zimbabwe is far from being Beijing's new priority. So, Beijing's interest is in a better investment climate in Zimbabwe. A clear transitional arrangement resulting in elections for a legitimate government in Harare is as much in Beijing's interest as London's. The "Look East" and the "Re-engagement with the West" strategies have not brought about the confidence and investment that Zimbabwe needs. What Zimbabwe requires is stable and accountable government - then investors from Asia, America and Europe will seriously consider that Zimbabwe has an investment future. This was the message that Mr Mugabe received in Beijing in January. And the one which Zimbabwe's military chief also was given last week.

Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter Six months after agreeing it could have a limited role, ministers look set to exclude the Chinese company, with no new equipment installed from next year. The move is in part a result of pressure from Washington. However, the precise time frame and details of the phase-out will be crucial in determining how the decision is received. In January, after a lengthy delays and hard-fought battles, the government announced that Huawei would be kept out of the sensitive core of the 5G network and limited to 35% market share of its other parts. But now it finds itself revisiting that decision. A key reason is the Trump administration has continued what one UK official calls a campaign of "unrelenting pressure" on the company. US officials have claimed China could use the firm as a gateway to "spy, steal or attack" the UK - Huawei denies this and its founder has said he would rather shut the company down than do anything to damage its clients. New sanctions in May limited Huawei's access to US chip technology. That forced the UK's National Cyber Security Centre to launch a review to understand whether using alternative chips would reduce the level of assurance it could offer about Huawei's presence in the UK. But the decision will be as much about geopolitics and domestic politics as it is about technicalities. Attitudes to China have hardened in the last six months. The Coronavirus crisis - and Beijing's handling of it - have increased concerns about dependencies on China. And the growing tension over Hong Kong has heightened concerns about whether China is becoming more authoritarian. A significant Conservative backbench rebellion in March suggested there were already many wanting a tougher policy, and their confidence and numbers have been fuelled by events in the intervening months. But amid heavy lobbying from telecoms companies, which have warned of mobile coverage blackouts if they are forced to remove Huawei equipment fast, the government has been debating how quickly to move. A long lead time for Huawei kit to be removed of seven to 10 years would leave critics unhappy but cause less disruption. Three to five years would placate them, but impose many more costs because of the need to rip out existing Huawei equipment, which is sometimes integrated with 4G and older equipment. If the telecom networks fall behind with their 5G rollout as a result, it would make it harder for the government to deliver on its promises of increasing connectivity for the country in the coming years. China may also seek some way of punishing the UK, partly to discourage others from following its course. But equally, if the new policy is seen as not tough enough, then critics on the backbenches may continue their rebellion to push for a tighter time-frame when legislation is brought to parliament in the autumn. Whatever the case, a decision which has already been overturned once may still be fought over in the months ahead.
By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent Well, first inject some powerful neurotoxins directly into its brain. This will make the bug compliant; it won't try to fly away and will bend to your will. Second, slice off one of its antennae and drink the goo that comes out. For snack purposes, you understand. And then lead it off to your lair by the stump, like a dog on a leash. You're going to bury this zombie in a hole in the ground. But just before you close up the tomb, lay an egg on the bug. Your progeny can have the joy of eating it alive. Dr Gavin Broad relishes these stories about how wasps will parasitise other critters. He's the principal curator in charge of insect collections at London's Natural History Museum, which means he's got plenty of material to work with. He has drawer after drawer of wasps, gathered from all corners of the globe. Ok, I can already hear you saying, "I hate wasps even if they kill roaches". But spend just a few minutes with Gavin and I promise you your views will evolve. You'll marvel at their skill and in quite a few cases you'll be stunned (not stung) by their beauty. That destroyer of cockroaches, for example - Ampulex compressa - has an extraordinary iridescent exoskeleton. You can see why they sometimes call it the jewel wasp. "But every wasp is glorious," says Gavin, as he urges you to move beyond the PR spin that's got us to prefer beetles and bees instead ("Bees are just furry wasps that turned vegetarian"). Wasps have their role in Nature and it's not to pester humans in the autumn. Ignore those "yellow jackets" getting drunk on cider in September orchards; they'll soon be gone. No, wasps have very useful functions, one of which is to keep other insects in check. Every insect you can think of probably has some wasp that will attack it. If that wasn't the case, we'd almost certainly be using more pesticides than we already do on our farms. It's the parasitoid wasps that do this work for us and their methods - like those of Ampulex compressa - are often ingenious. I'm fascinated by a splendid European wasp - Rhyssa persuasoria (sabre wasp). In part, I think, because I can't ever recall actually seeing one in the wild. They frequent British forests. It has a remarkable ovipositor. That's the multi-function "hypodermic needle" at the end of the abdomen, and, in this instance, it doubles the length of the wasp to about 8cm. The Rhyssa hunts the larvae of sawflies hiding under the bark of trees. When it senses one, it uses the ovipositor to drill through the wood fibres, to sting the grub and then lay an egg on it. Again, the wasp doesn't immediately kill its target; it uses venom merely to immobilise its prey. "The key to success for parasitoid wasps is keeping your meat fresh," says Gavin. He calls me into the next room, a cavernous opening full of those floor-to-ceiling museum cabinets that move on wheels. Gavin knows exactly which drawer he's after. We don't really do "big" in the UK, so as you might expect there are even more impressive versions of Rhyssa from elsewhere in the world. Meet the aptly named Megarhyssa. Species in this group have ovipositors that can reach 15cm in length. They store them in a bag. Megarhyssa will spend a couple of hours drilling through wood to get to its victim. That's a lot of energy to expend, especially if you miss your target, or, as occasionally happens, another wasp comes along with a slightly narrower ovipositor and uses the exact same drill hole to replace the egg you've just laid. Hello to the group of wasps called Pseudoryhssa. Nature works like that sometimes. Species will use every trick in the book to survive and thrive. Constant warfare. Gavin closes the drawer. There's even a wasp that will lay its egg inside the larva of another wasp that's already inside a caterpillar, he tells me. That sounds a bit like an entomologist's Christmas dinner: a duck inside a turkey, inside a goose. So, what's the biggest wasp? Probably one of the tarantula hawks like Pepsis. When Gavin gives talks to schoolchildren, this is always their favourite. You know the routine by now: the wasp lands on the spider, stings it to a standstill, and then positions an egg where the hatched grub can burrow its way inside. What's so impressive is that the larva will make sure it doesn't consume too early those organs that keep the tarantula alive. And the smallest wasp? Well, that would be the fairyfly wasps. Creatures like Kikiki and Tinkerbella. Gavin is holding a card with some imperceptible dots on it. These wasps are about 0.2mm in length. Absolutely tiny - you need a microscope to see them. They're so small in fact, they're probably at the very limits of what's possible in terms of miniaturised flight. And yet fly they do, to find and parasitise the eggs of other species and single-celled organisms. My hour with Gavin is almost up but he won't let me go until he's shown me some of the most impressive nests in the NHM's collection. "Wasps probably gave us the idea for paper," he says. They chew up wood and build the most exquisite papier-mâché structures. Even your classic autumn annoyance, Vespula vulgaris, is an accomplished architect. The paper envelope that surrounds its comb nest will have intricate swirls and waves. The more diverse the wood sources, the more unusual the patterns. The NHM collection even has a 1940s wasp nest made partially from wool. The wasps had recycled a nearby scarf. Gavin's passion for his subjects is obvious and immense. So what does he say when people tell him they hate wasps. "I just cry." He laughs. "Why don't people already love wasps? They're the lions of the insect world."

From next year it will subsidise local governments already running or starting projects that use AI to pair people up. Last year the number of babies born in Japan fell below 865,000 - a record low. The fast-greying nation has long been searching for ways to reverse one of the world's lowest fertility rates. Boosting the use of AI tech is one of its latest efforts. Next year the government plans to allocate local authorities 2bn yen ($19m, £14m) to boost the birth rate, reported AFP news agency. Many already offer human-run matchmaking services and some have introduced AI systems in the hope they will perform a more sophisticated analysis of the standardised forms where people submit their details. A few of the existing systems are limited to considering criteria such as income and age, only producing a result if there is an exact match. Local media say that the funding aims to allow authorities to harness more costly advanced systems that take into account factors like hobbies and values. "We are especially planning to offer subsidies to local governments operating or starting up matchmaking projects that use AI," a cabinet official told AFP. "We hope this support will help reverse the decline in the nation's birthrate." Japan's population is projected to fall from a peak of 128 million in 2017 to less than 53 million by the end of the century. Policymakers are racing to ensure the country's contracting workforce can meet the expanding costs of welfare. Sachiko Horiguchi, a socio-cultural and medical anthropologist at Japan's Temple University, thinks there are better ways for the government to bump up the birth rate than subsidising AI matchmaking - such as helping young people earning low wages. She pointed to a recent report which suggests a link between lower income levels and the loss of interest in romantic relationships among young Japanese adults. "If they're not interested in dating, the matchmaking would likely be ineffective," Dr Horiguchi told the BBC. "If we are to rely on technologies, affordable AI robots taking over household or childcare tasks may be more effective." Analysts have long pointed towards the lack of support for working mothers in Japan, where there are strong expectations women will do all the housework and raise children alongside doing their jobs. The government has said it wants to encourage more women into full-time employment in recent years but the gender gap has grown. Japan ranked 121st out of 153 countries in a 2019 report on gender equality by the World Economic Forum, slipping down 11 places from the year before. You may also be interested in...
Beijing says the US is also guilty of spying on other countries, including China, and accuses the US of hypocrisy and "double standards". China has summoned the US ambassador in Beijing over the incident. It says relations will be damaged. US prosecutors say the officers stole trade secrets and internal documents from five companies and a labour union. The BBC's John Sudworth in Shanghai says it is extremely unlikely that any of the accused will ever be handed over to the US. China's defence ministry put out a strongly-worded statement on its website on Tuesday saying that China's government and its military "had never engaged in any cyber espionage activities". It also took aim at the US, saying: "For a long time, the US has possessed the technology and essential infrastructure needed to conduct large-scale systematic cyber thefts and surveillance on foreign government leaders, businesses and individuals. This is a fact which the whole world knows. "The US' deceitful nature and its practice of double standards when it comes to cyber security have long been exposed, from the Wikileaks incident to the Edward Snowden affair." Analysis: Carrie Gracie, BBC China editor China always insists it is a victim of hacking, not a perpetrator. And when US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden appeared in Hong Kong a year ago with evidence of US hacking into Chinese networks, Beijing felt vindicated. The US acknowledges that it conducts espionage but says unlike China it does not spy on foreign companies and pass what it finds to its own companies. Beijing typically shrugs this off as a smear motivated by those who find its growing technological might hard to bear. But to see five named officers of the People's Liberation Army indicted by a US grand jury is not something that can be brushed aside so easily. China has already announced the suspension of co-operation with the US on an internet working group. And once it has had time to digest this loss of face, it is likely to consider more serious retaliation. The defence ministry added that China's military had been the target of many online attacks, and "a fair number" of those had been launched from American IP addresses. It said the arrest of the five Chinese army officers had "severely damaged mutual trust". A Xinhua report on Tuesday stated that between March and May this year, a total of 1.18 million computers in China were directly controlled by 2,077 machines in the United States via Trojan horse or zombie malware. Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Zheng Zeguang lodged a "solemn representation" with US ambassador Max Baucus on Monday night, Xinhua reported. 'US losses' On Monday US Attorney General Eric Holder said a grand jury had laid hacking charges against the Chinese nationals, the first against "known state actors for infiltrating US commercial targets by cyber means". He identified the alleged victims as Westinghouse Electric, US Steel, Alcoa Inc, Allegheny Technologies, SolarWorld and the US Steelworkers Union. "The alleged hacking appears to have been conducted for no reason other than to advantage state-owned companies and other interests in China, at the expense of businesses here in the United States," Mr Holder said. In the indictment brought in the western district of Pennsylvania - the heart of the US steel industry - the US named Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu, Huang Zhenyu, and Gu Chunhui, all officers in Unit 61398 of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), as the alleged conspirators. FBI officials said the hacking - between 2006 and 2014 - caused "significant losses" at the companies and that there were likely to be many more victims. Last year, cyber-defence company Mandiant published a report on a Chinese military unit the firm said was behind the vast majority of significant attacks on American federal agencies and companies. In March, Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Pentagon planned to more than triple its cyber-security capabilities in the next few years to defend against such internet attacks. What is Unit 61398? •A unit of China's People's Liberation Army, to whose Shanghai address US cyber security firm Mandiant says it traced a prolific hacking team •The team was said to have hacked into 141 computers across 20 industries, stealing hundreds of terabytes of data •Mandiant says the team would have been staffed by hundreds, possibly thousands of proficient English speakers •China said Mandiant's report was flawed and lacked proof
In lengthy closing statements, Nuon Chea, 87, and Khieu Samphan, 82, distanced themselves from the deaths under the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. It is believed that up to two million people died in that time. A verdict is expected early next year, two years after the trial started. Nuon Chea, the regime's number two leader, and Khieu Samphan, its head of state, have defended themselves in the past by insisting that they believed they were acting in the best interests of the nation and had been unaware of the full extent of killings. "It is easy to say that I should have known everything, I should have understood everything, and thus I could have intervened or rectified the situation at the time,'' Khieu Samphan defiantly told the court on Thursday, the Associated Press news agency reports. "Do you really think that that was what I wanted to happen to my people?" "The reality was that I did not have any power," he said. Nuon Chea - also known as Brother Number Two - defended his actions, saying he never ordered Khmer Rouge cadres "to mistreat or kill people to deprive them of food or commit any genocide." But he accepted "moral responsibility" for the deaths, repeating previous efforts to distance himself from the actual crimes. "I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, the victims, the families, and all Cambodian people," he said. The frail former leader spoke steadily as he read from pages of notes, Associated Press reports. "I wish to show my remorse and pray for the lost souls that occurred by any means" during the Khmer Rouge rule he said. 'Worse than monsters' Responding to Nuon Chea's testimony, Bin Sivla, 55, who lost 11 relatives under the regime, said "we cannot accept his apology. He lied to us. He wanted to be acquitted. He did not care about others," Agency France-Presse reports If he did not give the order, his subordinates would not have dared to kill," she said, describing the Khmer Rouge leaders as "worse than monsters". "Monsters would kill only a few people, but they killed millions of people." Two other people also faced charges along with Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan. But Ieng Thirith, 80, formerly the social affairs minister, was released after the tribunal ruled that she was unfit to stand trial due to illness. Her husband, former senior Khmer Rouge leader Ieng Sary, who served as the regime's foreign minister, died while on trial at the age of 87. Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998. The tribunal, established in 2006, has sentenced only one defendant so far. Chief jailer Kaing Guek Eav, known as Duch, was sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in running the notorious Tuol Sleng prison, where thousands of inmates were killed. The tribunal has run into problems, including court workers going on strike over unpaid wages in September. Rights groups and campaigners have criticised the pace of the trial and voiced fears that the age of its remaining two defendants may mean that justice is not served.
She wrote on Instagram: "As many of you know, Kanye has bipolar disorder. "Anyone who has this or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand." He is a "brilliant but complicated person" whose "words sometimes do not align with his intentions", she said. The rapper is one of America's biggest music stars, and is currently attempting to run for US president. But his first campaign rally and a number of recent Twitter messages have sparked confusion and concern. Kim and Kanye married in 2014 and have four children together. In her message on Wednesday, the TV personality and model said she had not previously spoken publicly about how his mental health had affected the family "because I am very protective of our children and Kanye's right to privacy when it comes to his health". She wrote: "But today, I feel like I should comment on it because of the stigma and misconceptions about mental health. "Those that understand mental illness or even compulsive behaviour know that the family is powerless unless the member is a minor. "People who are unaware or far removed from this experience can be judgemental and not understand that the individual themselves have to engage in the process of getting help no matter how hard family and friends try." Kardashian West went on to say her husband was "subject to criticism because he is a public figure and his actions at times can cause strong opinions and emotions", but asked for greater empathy and understanding. "He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bipolar disorder," she added. "Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words sometimes do not align with his intentions. "Living with bipolar disorder does not diminish or invalidate his dreams and his creative ideas, no matter how big or unobtainable they may feel to some. "That is part of his genius and as we have all witnessed, many of his big dreams have come true. "We as a society talk about giving grace to the issue of mental health as a whole, however we should also give it to the individuals who are living with it in times when they need it the most. "I kindly ask that the media and public give us the compassion and empathy that is needed so that we can get through this." What is bipolar disorder?

Speaking to reporters on a flight back from Brazil, he reaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church's position that homosexual acts were sinful, but homosexual orientation was not. He was responding to questions about whether there was a "gay lobby" in the Vatican. "If a person is gay and seeks God and has good will, who am I to judge?" He also said he wanted a greater role for women in the Church, but insisted they could not be priests. The Pope arrived back in Rome on Monday after a week-long tour of Brazil - his first trip abroad as pontiff - which climaxed with a huge gathering on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana beach for a world Catholic youth festival. Festival organisers estimated it attracted more than three million people. His remarks on gay people are being seen as much less judgemental than his predecessor's position on the issue. Pope Benedict XVI signed a document in 2005 that said men with deep-rooted homosexual tendencies should not be priests. But Pope Francis said gay clergymen should be forgiven and their sins forgotten. "The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains this very well," Pope Francis said in a wide-ranging 80-minute long interview with Vatican journalists. "It says they should not be marginalised because of this but that they must be integrated into society." But he condemned what he described as lobbying by gay people. "The problem is not having this orientation," he said. "We must be brothers. The problem is lobbying by this orientation, or lobbies of greedy people, political lobbies, Masonic lobbies, so many lobbies. This is the worse problem." On the role of women in the Church, he said: "We cannot limit the role of women in the Church to altar girls or the president of a charity, there must be more. "But with regards to the ordination of women, the Church has spoken and says no... That door is closed." Answering questions about the troubled Vatican bank, he said the institution must become "honest and transparent" and that he would listen to advice on whether it could be reformed or should be shut down altogether. "I don't know what will become of the bank. Some say it is better that is a bank, others that it should be a charitable fund and others say close it," he said. 'Undisciplined' Before leaving Brazil, Pope Francis gave a highly unusual one-to-one interview to a Brazilian TV programme. The interview was shown on TV Globo's high-profile Sunday night documentary programme Fantastico, broadcast not long after the Pope departed for Rome. The Pope was asked about the moment on his visit when his driver took a wrong turn and his vehicle was surrounded by crowds. "I don't feel afraid," he answered. "I know that no-one dies before their time. "I don't want to see these people who have such a great heart from behind a glass box. The two security teams [from the Vatican and Brazil] worked very well. But I know that I am undisciplined in that respect." Asked about the recent protests by young people on the streets of Brazil, the Pope said: "The young person is essentially a non-conformist, and this is very beautiful. "It is necessary to listen to young people, give them places to express themselves and to be careful that they aren't manipulated." Asked about his simple lifestyle and use of a small car, he said it wasn't a good example when a priest had the latest model of a car or a top brand. "At this moment I believe God is asking us for more simplicity," he added.
They said they were investigating HSBC Private Bank (Suisse) and "persons unknown for suspected aggravated money laundering". The investigation could be extended to people suspected of committing or participating in money laundering. HSBC said it was "co-operating with the Swiss authorities." The raid comes more than a week after allegations first emerged that HSBC's Swiss private bank may have helped wealthy clients evade tax. HSBC published a full-page advert in several weekend papers containing an apology over the claims. The chief executive of HSBC's Swiss private bank, Franco Morra, said last week it had shut down accounts from clients who "did not meet our high standards". Mr Morra added the revelations about "historical business practices" were a reminder that the old business model of Swiss private banking was no longer acceptable. Criminal investigation HM Revenue & Customs was given the leaked data in 2010 and has identified 1,100 people who had not paid their taxes. Last week, HSBC admitted that it was "accountable for past control failures", but said it had now "fundamentally changed". "We acknowledge that the compliance culture and standards of due diligence in HSBC's Swiss private bank, as well as the industry in general, were significantly lower than they are today," it added. The bank faces criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina, but not in the UK, where HSBC is based. HSBC said it was "co-operating with relevant authorities". Political row Geneva's attorney general, Olivier Jornot, told reporters the investigation could be extended to individuals suspected of money laundering or tax fraud. "The goal of this investigation is precisely to verify if the information that has been made public are well-founded and if de facto reproaches can be made, whether it be towards the bank, or towards physical persons, like collaborators or clients," he said. Offshore accounts are not illegal, but many people use them to hide cash from the tax authorities. And while tax avoidance is perfectly legal, deliberately hiding money to evade tax is not. The allegations have caused a political storm in the UK over who knew what and when. The leaked data was not received by the government until 2010 by which time the coalition had taken power, but refers to tax evasion that took place under the last Labour government between 2005 and 2007. The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative peer and appointed to the government. Lord Green was made a minister eight months after HMRC had been given the leaked documents from his bank. He served as a minister of trade and investment until 2013. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls has written to the chancellor accusing him of keeping quiet about the HSBC revelations. But Treasury sources said George Osborne had given several interviews in the last few days on the matter, and that there was nothing new in Labour's letter.
By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent Policy Exchange warns that UK digital firms are at risk of being starved of the highly-skilled staff they need to expand, because of visa restrictions. It argues the US gains an advantage by hiring from a global talent pool. Report author Chris Yiu says skilled graduates are in "short supply". The report is published as London Metropolitan University is taking legal action to overturn a decision to stop them recruiting overseas students. Borderless industries The Policy Exchange report highlights tensions in trying to maintain tight national migration rules while at the same time trying to nurture fast-moving industries which rely upon a highly-mobile, internationalised workforce. It calls for a more sophisticated differentiation between attracting talent and maintaining borders. It raises concerns that the next generation of digital entrepreneurs are more likely to be drawn to places such as California. "Start-ups need to be able to take on the right people fast, not spend months trying to expand their technology teams. That's why we need to make it easier for UK start-ups to take on highly-skilled foreign graduates," says report author, Mr Yiu. "Companies like Intel, Yahoo!, Google, eBay and YouTube were all co-founded by immigrant entrepreneurs. They are now major global businesses. We need to create the right conditions to ensure that the UK lives up to its potential to be a world leader in the digital economy." The report suggests that employers need to have more flexibility over employing overseas graduates and allowing them to act as sponsors. It also calls for changes to the "post-study" visa regulations for graduates when they finish at a UK university - to make it easier for science and technology graduates to continue working in the UK's digital industries. These rules had been tightened after fears that this time after graduation had become an immigration loophole. Without creating a more effective channel to recruit from overseas, the report argues that digital start-ups will not have access to sufficient numbers of high quality staff. A spokeswoman for the Home Office said: "Latest visa stats show that around 40% of those coming here to work are joining the IT sector and we have made sure innovative student entrepreneurs who are creating wealth are able to stay in the UK to pursue their ideas. "Our immigration reforms have brought in a more selective system which attracts the brightest and the best from across the world whilst bringing net migration down to sustainable levels." Technology hubs A report from Oxford University earlier this year produced a map of digital economies - and showed how "technology hubs" grew up in clusters, often around universities and research centres, and depended on a supply of suitably-qualified graduates. These technology hubs - such as Silicon Valley or around Boston in the US - had a high concentration of innovation and competed for talent on an international basis. In the longer term, the report argues that the education system in the UK will need to generate more home-grown talent - but there needs to be a more immediate response for industries which otherwise might re-locate. "In the near-term, making it easier to tap into the global pool of digital talent would help ensure that today's digital start-ups are still around to employ our school leavers and graduates of the future," says the report.
The authorities say the evictions are needed to deal with an outbreak of scabies in the camps, where numbers have swelled in recent months. The migrants have been trying to get to Britain, and say they have nowhere else to go after the camps are destroyed. Police moved into the site after a deadline for people to leave expired. Several busloads of police in riot gear arrived at the camps early on Wednesday. After a stand-off with local activists, the officers moved in and told migrants to pack their bags. Paul Adams, BBC News, Calais The camps are cleared, but what happens next? Having failed to explain their plan until after the appearance of riot police, the Calais authorities should not be surprised that no-one seems to trust their intentions. The buses stand empty. Repeated efforts by local officials to explain their proposals are met with disbelief. This is just the latest episode in a long-running saga. The migrants complain that they live like animals, with minimal shelter, appalling sanitation and little food. Now the authorities are offering to provide a shower, clean clothes and a better place to live. But the migrants, urged on by local activists, are refusing to co-operate. Even as their camps are bulldozed and the migrants find themselves dispersed once more, they are bound to return to this place to risk their lives again and again. An Eritrean man said he had tried to cross the English Channel by boarding lorries but was stopped by police several times. "I will try again and again," he told the BBC. Local officials say the migrants will be transported to new accommodation somewhere in the region, but initial attempts to persuade them to board buses were unsuccessful. Most people at the camps believe the UK will be a more welcoming place if only they can get there, our correspondent says. In 2002 the French government closed the main Red Cross centre at Sangatte near Calais, but insanitary illegal camps have sprung up in its place. The migrants have been sheltering under plastic bags and sheets, without water, power or even enough food. The camps are a few hundred metres from a terminal where ferries take passengers and goods back and forth between France and the UK.
Authorities said the redesign was to stop confusion between its nationals and citizens of China. The island is for all practical purposes an independent state but China sees it as a breakaway province. A Beijing foreign ministry spokeswoman said this would not change Taiwan being an "inalienable part of China". Officials unveiled the new passports at a ceremony on Wednesday. The English words Republic of China - Taiwan's official name - will be moved from the top of the cover to instead wrap around the national emblem in a smaller font, and the English word Taiwan will be larger and in bold. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic "our people have kept hoping that we can give more prominence to Taiwan's visibility, avoiding people mistakenly thinking they are from China", Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters. As countries have imposed travel bans in a bid to combat the outbreak they have imposed the same restrictions on travellers from Taiwan as from China, authorities have said. The spread of Covid-19 has brought the Taiwan dispute back to prominence. While it has won international praise for its handling of the health crisis, it is not a member of the World Health Organization (WHO). China has not allowed it to attend any WHO meetings since 2016. Taiwan has governed itself since 1949, when the mainland government fled to the island after its defeat by the Communist Party in China's civil war. It has its own democratically elected government, its own army and its own currency. But under the One China policy, the government in Beijing insists it is the legitimate ruler of Taiwan. It says the territory will one day come under its leadership again - by force if necessary. Few countries diplomatically recognise Taiwan as a sovereign nation, and China has reacted furiously when countries, dignitaries or businesses have suggested as much. Milos Vystrcil, Senate speaker in the Czech Republic, visited Taiwan on Tuesday. He gave a speech to its parliament announcing his support and declaring "I am Taiwanese" - a reference to US President John F Kennedy's famous "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech in 1963. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi denounced the move, saying Mr Vystrcil had "crossed a red line" and said he would "pay a heavy price". It came just weeks after US cabinet member Alex Azar travelled to Taiwan and met President Tsai Ing-wen. The health and human services secretary was the highest-ranking US politician to hold meetings on the island for decades. “China firmly opposes any official interactions between the US and Taiwan,” a foreign ministry spokesman said when the visit was announced. “We urge the US… not to send any wrong signals to ‘Taiwan independence’ elements to avoid severe damage to China-US relations.”
The WTO said the US did not provide evidence that its claims of China's unfair technology theft and state aid justified the border taxes. Chinese officials welcomed the ruling. But the US said it showed that the WTO was "completely inadequate" to the task of confronting China. Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, America's top trade negotiator, said the US "must be allowed to defend itself against unfair trade practices". "This panel report confirms what the Trump Administration has been saying for four years: The WTO is completely inadequate to stop China's harmful technology practices," he said. "Although the panel did not dispute the extensive evidence submitted by the US of intellectual property theft by China, its decision shows that the WTO provides no remedy for such misconduct." US-China trade war China brought the case to the WTO in 2018, as the Trump administration started preparing the first rounds of tariffs on what would eventually become more than $300bn worth of products. The complaint challenged tariffs enacted in June and September of 2018 on goods estimated at more than $200bn in annual trade. The US said the duties were a response to China's state-sanctioned technology theft, subsidies and other "unfair practices" and allowed under 1970s-era trade rules. But China said the taxes violated trade regulations because they were higher than US commitments and targeted only one country. A panel of WTO experts agreed with those claims. It added that the US had not proved its case that the tariffs were justified on moral grounds because it did not show how the products affected by the duties had benefited from the unfair practices. "The panel found, accordingly, that the US had not met its burden of demonstrating that the measures are provisionally justified," it said. 'Unprecedented global trade tensions' The panel added that it had only looked into the US measures and not China's retaliation, which Washington has not challenged at the WTO. Noting "unprecedented global trade tensions", the three-person panel encouraged the two sides to work to resolve the overall dispute. In a statement on Tuesday, China's Commerce Ministry said it hoped the US would respect the rulings of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and take practical action to maintain the multilateral trading system. The Trump administration, which has repeatedly criticised the WTO, may appeal the decision. But the case could then enter a legal paralysis because Washington has blocked the appointment of judges to the appellate body, preventing it from convening the minimum number required to hear cases.
Cabbies gathered at Trafalgar Square at 14:00 BST for the hour-long protest. The drivers are angry about what they regard as a lack of regulation of the use of apps such as Uber. The app works out the cost of journeys and cab drivers say it is the same as using a taxi meter, which only black cabs are legally entitled to use. The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) also said part of the demonstration was about highlighting the length of training - between four and seven years - that taxi drivers undergo before being licensed. During the protest, roads were gridlocked around Parliament Square, Whitehall and Trafalgar Square. Steve McNamara, from the LTDA, said: "We did not set out to cause disruption to Londoners. "It is nothing to do with technology, some of the taxis have been using apps for years. The difference is all taxis have to operate legally, they [Uber] should have to apply for the same rules as everyone else." He added that two drivers had been arrested and 10,000 drivers had attended the protest. But Scotland Yard denied any arrests had been made and Transport for London estimated that about 4,000 drivers had taken part. Despite the protest, Uber said it had seen the number of people downloading its app increase by 850% compared to last Wednesday. The Metropolitan Police had imposed strict conditions on protesters, including limiting the protest to an hour, after they failed to meet officers to discuss their plans. Ch Sup Pippa Mills said, "Those who took part in today's protest complied with the timings set by police. "However, we would always encourage organisers to meet with us to discuss their plans in advance so that they can achieve their aims around protest and we can ensure that disruption to the broader community is minimised." Steve Garelick of the GMB union said: "I can categorically refute the claim that police have contacted me about this protest." BBC London 94.9's Anna O'Neill said Haymarket was brought to a standstill and at one point cabs were prevented from accessing Trafalgar Square. Some motorists sat on the pavements as they waited for the protest to end. David Batist, 28, said although he had received an email alert from TfL warning him about the potential disruption it had been worse that expected. "I didn't expect this. I would've taken a different route, had I known. It's caused me quite a lot of disruption. I've had to cancel a meeting." Black cab driver Bernie Doyle, 68, said: "If Paris, Milan and Berlin don't accept it why should we? I've been driving 42 years and I'm not about to see my trade go down the pan." Stewart Rose, who has been been driving since 1971, said: "It's the beginning of the end for us. If Uber can do it what's going to stop other companies from getting this app? "Why did they award them the licence before it went to court, they've done it the wrong way round." Organisations including the Rail and Maritime Transport union, London Cab Drivers Club and Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) were represented at the protest. Some in Trafalgar Square were heard chanting "Boris, Boris, Boris, out, out, out", while others beeped horns and held placards. Uber launched in 2009 and operates in more than 70 cities across 37 countries. While those opposed to it are concerned unlicensed drivers are being contacted via the app, with no checks on whether they are legitimate, Uber said "every driver meets all local regulations" and is vetted with insurance and background checks. TfL is seeking a High Court ruling on whether the use of such an app is legal. The protests in London follow similar demonstrations in Paris, Madrid, Rome, Milan and Berlin.
Manuel Valls said about 15,000 people were being monitored for radicalisation as the country continues its drive against jihadist militants. Previously the authorities said about 10,000 were identified as high-risk. A boy of 15 was arrested at his home in Paris on Saturday on suspicion of planning an attack over the weekend. Investigators said he had been under surveillance since April and he had been in touch with a French member of so-called Islamic State (IS), Rachid Kassim. France has been under a state of emergency since IS attacks on Paris in November killed 130 people in what President Francois Hollande called an "act of war". However, a recent commission of inquiry found the state of emergency was only having a "limited impact" on improving security. It questioned the deployment of between 6,000 and 7,000 soldiers to protect schools, synagogues, department stores and other sensitive sites. 'There will be new attacks' "Today the threat is at a maximum, and we are a target," Mr Valls told French media. "Every day intelligence services, police, foil attacks, dismantle networks, track terrorists. There are about 15,000 people in France who are monitored, because these people are in the process of radicalisation." In a sombre interview, the Socialist prime minister said: "There will be new attacks. There will be innocent victims." Security is a central issue in the run-up to next year's presidential election but Mr Valls said proposals by the former French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, to set up special courts and detention centres were not the answer. Mr Sarkozy, who announced in August he would run again for the presidency, gave an interview to the Sunday newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche (in French). "Every Frenchman suspected of being linked to terrorism, because he regularly consults a jihadist website, or his behaviour shows signs of radicalisation or because is in close contact with radicalised people, must by preventively placed in a detention centre," he said. Meanwhile, prosecutors charged one of the women arrested over a foiled attack near Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Ornella G, 29, was charged with alleged involvement in a terrorist act and attempted murder. Three other women were questioned by police, after a car packed with gas cylinders was found last Sunday close to the cathedral. They are alleged to have been planning other "imminent and violent" attacks. Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said on Friday that Ornella G's fingerprints had been found inside the car. She was known to intelligence agents as someone who was considering going to Syria. She was arrested in southern France on Tuesday with her boyfriend, who has since been released.
By Jonathan MarcusDiplomatic analyst Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg was one of the first to respond, tweeting "shocking scenes in Washington DC. The outcome of this democratic election must be respected". Who could ever have imagined such a comment, coming from the alliance's top official addressed to its leading member state? It is the sort of thing you would expect Mr Stoltenberg to be sending to a Belarus or a Venezuela. The episode says much about Washington's standing in the world after four years of the Donald Trump presidency. The US has haemorrhaged both influence and soft power. It has pulled out of arms control agreements, the Iran nuclear deal, and a major climate accord. It has sought to reduce its military engagements overseas while offering little in the way of diplomatic alternatives. Countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have all, to an extent, sought to provide for their own security, mindful that the US president's attention span is limited. Indeed Donald Trump often appears to regard authoritarian leaders as more convivial hosts than the heads of government of many of his democratic allies. The forces of attraction that made the country a model for aspiring democrats everywhere are tarnished, its fissures are there for all to see. Today, as analyst Ian Bremmer notes: "The US is by far the most politically dysfunctional and divided of all the world's advanced industrial democracies." This matters because, over recent years, the international system has clearly suffered from Mr Trump's decision to pursue an America First policy. Authoritarians are on the march. China and Russia both feel their influence has been bolstered during the Trump years. The institutions of the liberal order - like Nato, the UN and many of its agencies - face varying degrees of crisis. Cyber-attacks and so-called grey-zone operations - just short of the threshold of war - are becoming commonplace. The world faces acute crises like the pandemic and climate change and under Mr Trump's watch, the US has simply not turned up for duty. Let's be clear here. This is not a call for US dominion over the globe. Often an expansive US foreign policy has been as much a part of the problem as part of any solution. But US defence and security policy is not in a good place. The whole fabric of arms control agreements inherited from the Cold War years, from the INF treaty to Open Skies, is crumbling. Indeed a last-ditch effort to renew the last accord constraining the US and Russian arsenals of strategic nuclear weapons - the New Start treaty - will be an early item on President-elect Joe Biden's agenda. Arms control is gaining greater importance as deadly new weapons systems like high-speed hypersonic missiles are developed, not to mention the growing militarisation of space. The west has to contend with the rise of a more assertive China and the return of a more aggressive Russia. So US involvement, leadership, call it what you will, is essential to even start grappling with the underlying issues involved. This all poses huge problems for the incoming Biden administration. Washington's enemies are on a high after the storming of the Capitol. The new president arrives in power with China's economy already rebounding from the pandemic whilst America's Covid response is failing badly with massive death rates and uncertainty about the effectiveness of the vaccine roll-out. Indeed the pandemic is an issue that President Trump has largely ignored since his election defeat. No wonder then that the Chinese President Xi Jinping is convinced that the crisis has demonstrated the superiority of his system. Russia may be more of an irritant than a strategic competitor for Washington, but the disinformation and hacking operations that book-ended the Trump years are something radically new in scale and impact. Joe Biden will be at the helm of an administration where many of its agencies are using computer systems that have been penetrated by the Russians. Nobody yet knows how deep or how permanent this intrusion might be. Even among America's friends the new administration's course is unlikely to all be plain sailing. Of course the new president will be warmly welcomed by Washington's allies abroad, especially within the EU and the G7 groupings. Others like the Saudis, the Turks and the Israelis are rapidly triangulating or re-adjusting their policies, seeking to enable a new dialogue with the Biden team. But don't expect any honeymoon for the new US administration to last long. The divisions within the Atlantic alliance for example may be papered over fairly quickly. But Mr Biden is going to place demands on his European partners just as the Trump administration did. He will also want more defence spending and in addition concerted and tough policies towards Iran, China and Russia. Creating these new policy coalitions is not going to be as easy as it might first appear. Look at the recent investment treaty between the European Union and Beijing, something many in the incoming Biden team hoped could be delayed. Is such a trade deal, they ask, really the way to respond to China's suppression of democracy in Hong Kong, its hounding of the Uighurs, or its economic blackmail directed against Australia? It's not exactly an auspicious start. Policy differences, commercial ties and Europe's own desire for a greater degree of strategic autonomy will all complicate relations with Washington. But beyond this there is another potent factor contributing to tension. It's all very well the Biden administration putting the rebuilding of alliances near the top of its foreign policy agenda but many of those allies are uncertain that Trumpism has gone for good. It is not just shock at the storming of the Capitol. They fear that Mr Biden may provide only a four-year pause, after which a new form of Trumpism might return to power. Will some of Washington's allies hedge their bets just in case? This is a moment where US domestic policy has become perhaps the most critical element helping to guide its approach abroad. Indeed you might even say that all policy now in Biden's America is domestic. This is true in two critical senses. Rebuilding American democracy, making it a more equal and less febrile society, is essential to rebuilding "brand America" abroad. Only if its allies (and enemies) can be sure that the US is truly back on a different and consistent track can they have confidence in Washington's leadership for the future. But this centrality of domestic policy works both ways. If President-elect Biden is to have success abroad, he needs to win over his divided country to rally behind his foreign policy. Take China for example. Mr Biden wants both to compete but also co-operate with Beijing where possible. Commercial policy here is almost more important than the traditional currency of strategy - warships or overseas bases. And the foundation of a successful commercial policy towards China can only be one that ordinary Americans see as serving their interests, that brings back jobs and a level playing field in international trade. Restoring the state of the union may be the most important factor underpinning any success Mr Biden might have abroad. Jonathan Marcus is a former BBC diplomatic and defence correspondent
Home Secretary Priti Patel said the UK was still at "a high level of threat" and an attack could "occur without further warning". The terrorism threat is now at its lowest since August 2014. Substantial is the third of five ratings at which the threat level can stand. The separate terrorism threat level for Northern Ireland remains "severe". Ms Patel said in a statement on Monday that terrorism remained a "direct and immediate" risk to the UK's national security. Assessments determining the country's threat level are taken by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) - part of MI5 - which makes its recommendations independently from the government. "Government, police and intelligence agencies will continue to work tirelessly to address the threat posed by terrorism in all its forms," Ms Patel said. The threat level is kept under "constant review", she added. Neil Basu, head of counter terrorism policing, said there had been "positive developments" in the fight against terrorism but it was "vital that we all maintain a high level of vigilance". He said the UK's counter terrorism policing team had about 800 live counter terrorism investigations - while 24 attack plots had been thwarted since the Westminster attack in March 2017. This is a significant change in the only official public measure of the threat posed by terrorism to the UK - but it's not a sign that there are suddenly fewer people with aspirations to do us harm. The security services are still monitoring thousands of "subjects of interest" - the top-tier of would-be plotters from jihadist groups to the far-right. Many of these people are very dangerous because, in the jargon, they are "lone actors" bent on DIY violence. But what appears to have changed is the resources and capability available to IS-supporting plotters who need help. Quite simply, a huge number of the foreign fighters who played a key role linking these followers to resources and support died on the battlefields of the militant group's last stand. Continuing propaganda from the survivors, portraying IS as a force to be reckoned with, also has less credibility for would-be recruits. And so it has become harder - for now at least - for some of those with intent to get the help they need to carry out their aspirations. The UK's terrorism threat level was raised to the highest rating, "critical", in the days following the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017. It last reached this level again briefly in September that year, after a bomb partially exploded on a Tube train at Parsons Green. The threat level had remained at the second highest rating, "severe", until Monday. The Northern Ireland threat level specifically refers to threat to the country from Northern Ireland-related terrorism. It remains at severe - the second-highest level. The five levels of threat set by the JTAC are:
By Yvette TanBBC News On paper it seemed like a straightforward cultural exchange, so why has this prized masterpiece created 1,200 years ago caused so much anger today? A household name in China The calligraphy, titled Requiem to My Nephew, was painted by Yan Zhenqing - considered to be one of the greatest calligraphers in China. He lived between 709 to 785 AD. Yan Zhenqing wrote the piece in 759 AD, after he found that his nephew had died. "He's a household name in China," Fine Arts professor Tong Kam Tang of the Chinese University of Hong Kong told the BBC. "When you're young and you study Chinese art, you'll learn [about him]." Mr Tong said the piece of work was a draft by Yan Zhenqing, and so carried markings and scribbles written by the author, making it even more prized. The final piece has long been lost. The artwork was preserved in China for centuries until it was taken to Taiwan in the 1940s - along with other Chinese antiquities - when Chinese nationalists defeated by communist forces fled to the island. It's been since kept securely in Taiwan's National Palace Museum - this is only the second time the work has been loaned overseas. It was lent in 1997 to the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC, but has remained in Taiwan ever since. The work is now being displayed in Tokyo as part of an exhibition titled "Unrivalled Calligraphy: Yan Zhengqing and His Legacy". The museum says Yan "reflected the changing consciousness of the times to brilliant effect in his calligraphy" and that the piece in question is "infused with grief". A nation's anger News of the loan shocked many users on Chinese social media site Weibo, many of whom reacted with anger. As of Tuesday, the hashtag "Requiem to My Nephew" has been read more than 260 million times on Weibo. Many people mentioned Japan and China's wartime history and the Japanese occupation, which remain raw subjects in China. "Has Taiwan forgotten what Japan did to us? Do they know what the Nanjing massacre is?" said one user on Weibo, referencing one hugely sensitive issue. In 1937, Japanese troops invaded the eastern city of Nanjing. China says more than 300,000 of its people were massacred - while some Japanese nationalists deny any killings took place. "This is humiliating. This piece represents the heart and soul of China... and they are sending it to Japan. This is an insult to our ancestors," said another. Others expressed more anger towards Taiwan. "That's it. Let's force Taiwan to reunify," said a Weibo comment. "Taiwan would rather loan our national treasure to Japan rather than give it back to us. Taiwan is crazy," another added. Social media in China is heavily controlled. Comments on sensitive issues are often censored, and conversely, comments on issues that align with government policy are often used to its advantage. Chinese state media outlet the Global Times did not directly address any political concerns, but instead spoke to an expert who said that the relic was "in jeopardy while being transported", saying that sunlight would harm the ancient paper. A statement released by the National Palace Museum stated that the item was "stable and suitable for overseas exhibitions". 'A random spark' It's clear that a lot of the anger is political. "Japan's very brutal invasion of several parts of China during the 1930-40s still elicit very bad memories in China. Part of this is mainly due to the fact that the Chinese side has continually stressed this memory," said Prof Ian Chong of the National University of Singapore. "The fact that this work - that I suppose many in China are attached [to] - is going to Japan [is why] you see a lot of this angst being demonstrated." Taiwan is a self-governed democracy and for all practical purposes has acted as an independent nation since 1949. China however considers the island to be a breakaway province which will one day be fully reunited with the mainland. Earlier this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping had urged Taiwan to accept that it "must and will be" reunited with China. He also warned that China reserved the right to use force, causing Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen to say that the island would "never" accept reunification under the terms offered by Beijing. "The recent effort by Xi insisting on reunification has also sort of heightened tensions," said Dr Chong. "The loan of this artwork, which seems like a straightforward issue, has kind of found itself wrapped up in the middle of this." According to the Global Times, Chinese law also does not allow "valuable cultural relics, especially paintings and calligraphy" to leave the country. The loan, says Dr Chong, could then also be interpreted as another move by Taiwan to show that it "doesn't abide by [Chinese] laws." "So you have all these layers, what is Taiwan's place in relation to China, the Sino-Japanese tensions, all these sore points. And all it takes is a random spark to reignite everything."
By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent Well, first inject some powerful neurotoxins directly into its brain. This will make the bug compliant; it won't try to fly away and will bend to your will. Second, slice off one of its antennae and drink the goo that comes out. For snack purposes, you understand. And then lead it off to your lair by the stump, like a dog on a leash. You're going to bury this zombie in a hole in the ground. But just before you close up the tomb, lay an egg on the bug. Your progeny can have the joy of eating it alive. Dr Gavin Broad relishes these stories about how wasps will parasitise other critters. He's the principal curator in charge of insect collections at London's Natural History Museum, which means he's got plenty of material to work with. He has drawer after drawer of wasps, gathered from all corners of the globe. Ok, I can already hear you saying, "I hate wasps even if they kill roaches". But spend just a few minutes with Gavin and I promise you your views will evolve. You'll marvel at their skill and in quite a few cases you'll be stunned (not stung) by their beauty. That destroyer of cockroaches, for example - Ampulex compressa - has an extraordinary iridescent exoskeleton. You can see why they sometimes call it the jewel wasp. "But every wasp is glorious," says Gavin, as he urges you to move beyond the PR spin that's got us to prefer beetles and bees instead ("Bees are just furry wasps that turned vegetarian"). Wasps have their role in Nature and it's not to pester humans in the autumn. Ignore those "yellow jackets" getting drunk on cider in September orchards; they'll soon be gone. No, wasps have very useful functions, one of which is to keep other insects in check. Every insect you can think of probably has some wasp that will attack it. If that wasn't the case, we'd almost certainly be using more pesticides than we already do on our farms. It's the parasitoid wasps that do this work for us and their methods - like those of Ampulex compressa - are often ingenious. I'm fascinated by a splendid European wasp - Rhyssa persuasoria (sabre wasp). In part, I think, because I can't ever recall actually seeing one in the wild. They frequent British forests. It has a remarkable ovipositor. That's the multi-function "hypodermic needle" at the end of the abdomen, and, in this instance, it doubles the length of the wasp to about 8cm. The Rhyssa hunts the larvae of sawflies hiding under the bark of trees. When it senses one, it uses the ovipositor to drill through the wood fibres, to sting the grub and then lay an egg on it. Again, the wasp doesn't immediately kill its target; it uses venom merely to immobilise its prey. "The key to success for parasitoid wasps is keeping your meat fresh," says Gavin. He calls me into the next room, a cavernous opening full of those floor-to-ceiling museum cabinets that move on wheels. Gavin knows exactly which drawer he's after. We don't really do "big" in the UK, so as you might expect there are even more impressive versions of Rhyssa from elsewhere in the world. Meet the aptly named Megarhyssa. Species in this group have ovipositors that can reach 15cm in length. They store them in a bag. Megarhyssa will spend a couple of hours drilling through wood to get to its victim. That's a lot of energy to expend, especially if you miss your target, or, as occasionally happens, another wasp comes along with a slightly narrower ovipositor and uses the exact same drill hole to replace the egg you've just laid. Hello to the group of wasps called Pseudoryhssa. Nature works like that sometimes. Species will use every trick in the book to survive and thrive. Constant warfare. Gavin closes the drawer. There's even a wasp that will lay its egg inside the larva of another wasp that's already inside a caterpillar, he tells me. That sounds a bit like an entomologist's Christmas dinner: a duck inside a turkey, inside a goose. So, what's the biggest wasp? Probably one of the tarantula hawks like Pepsis. When Gavin gives talks to schoolchildren, this is always their favourite. You know the routine by now: the wasp lands on the spider, stings it to a standstill, and then positions an egg where the hatched grub can burrow its way inside. What's so impressive is that the larva will make sure it doesn't consume too early those organs that keep the tarantula alive. And the smallest wasp? Well, that would be the fairyfly wasps. Creatures like Kikiki and Tinkerbella. Gavin is holding a card with some imperceptible dots on it. These wasps are about 0.2mm in length. Absolutely tiny - you need a microscope to see them. They're so small in fact, they're probably at the very limits of what's possible in terms of miniaturised flight. And yet fly they do, to find and parasitise the eggs of other species and single-celled organisms. My hour with Gavin is almost up but he won't let me go until he's shown me some of the most impressive nests in the NHM's collection. "Wasps probably gave us the idea for paper," he says. They chew up wood and build the most exquisite papier-mâché structures. Even your classic autumn annoyance, Vespula vulgaris, is an accomplished architect. The paper envelope that surrounds its comb nest will have intricate swirls and waves. The more diverse the wood sources, the more unusual the patterns. The NHM collection even has a 1940s wasp nest made partially from wool. The wasps had recycled a nearby scarf. Gavin's passion for his subjects is obvious and immense. So what does he say when people tell him they hate wasps. "I just cry." He laughs. "Why don't people already love wasps? They're the lions of the insect world."

By Chi Chi IzunduNewsbeat reporter in Madrid The Desperate Housewives actress says she loves being a host and is looking forward to the awards. The 34-year-old revealed she hasn't given much thought to her wardrobe for the show yet. Apart from knowing she wants to wear a VB dress: "She's definitely sending over some things." She added: "I definitely want to wear one of Victoria's dresses. I just absolutely love her dresses and I think structurally they're just absolutely beautiful and form fitting. "That's the only dress I am sure of as of right now. One of Victoria's." The MTV Europe Awards take place in Madrid on Sunday ( November 7). Bon Jovi will receive the Global Icon honour. Katy Perry and Lady Gaga lead the nominations with five apiece, Eminem follows with four, while teen sensation Justin Bieber has three nods. Eva Longoria Parker also had to rap in an advert for the awards but admitted she was terrified. Artist drama So can fans expect to see Eva spitting some lyrics live at the weekend? "I don't know, because I haven't seen a script," she said. "But that would be, definitely, something." And as for any possible artist drama on stage, the star says she won't be getting involved in trying to control anyone. She said: "Award shows, you never know what's going to happen with performances, with speeches, with fashion. "That's what makes it so amazing to watch, because you are waiting for something to happen."
Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin, citing information from the "black box" voice recorder, said the co-pilot was alone in the cockpit. He intentionally started a descent while the pilot was locked out. Mr Robin said there was "absolute silence in the cockpit" as the pilot fought to re-enter it. He said air traffic controllers made repeated attempts to contact the aircraft, but to no avail. Passengers could be heard screaming just before the crash, he added. Details are emerging of the German co-pilot's past - although his apparent motives for causing the crash remain a mystery. Live updates from the day What happened in the final half hour? Mr Lubitz, 27, had undergone intensive training and "was 100% fit to fly without any caveats", according to Carsten Spohr, the head of Lufthansa, the German carrier that owns Germanwings. Mr Spohr said Mr Lubitz's training had been interrupted for several months six years ago, but did not say why. The training was resumed after "the suitability of the candidate was re-established", he said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters that the co-pilot's apparent actions had given the tragedy a "new, simply incomprehensible dimension". Police have been searching the co-pilot's home in Montabaur, near Frankfurt, as well as a flat he kept in Duesseldorf. The Airbus 320 from Barcelona to Duesseldorf hit a mountain, killing all 144 passengers and six crew, after an eight-minute descent. Andreas Lubitz: Germanwings co-pilot under scrutiny Who was Andreas Lubitz? "We hear the pilot ask the co-pilot to take control of the plane and we hear at the same time the sound of a seat moving backwards and the sound of a door closing," Mr Robin told reporters. He said the pilot, named in the German media as Patrick S, had probably gone to the toilet. "At that moment, the co-pilot is controlling the plane by himself. While he is alone, the co-pilot presses the buttons of the flight monitoring system to put into action the descent of the aeroplane. Crash site close-ups "He operated this button for a reason we don't know yet, but it appears that the reason was to destroy this plane." Meanwhile, online tracking service Flightradar24 said satellite data it had analysed found that someone had changed the plane's altitude from 38,000ft (11,582m) to 100ft - the minimum setting possible. "Between 09:30:52 and 09:30:55 you can see that the autopilot was manually changed from 38,000ft to 100ft and nine seconds later the aircraft started to descend, probably with the 'open descent' autopilot setting," Flightradar24 chief Fredrik Lindahl was quoted as saying by Reuters. Mr Lubitz was alive until the final impact, Mr Robin said. The prosecutor added that "the most plausible interpretation" was that the co-pilot had deliberately barred the pilot from re-entering the cockpit. He added that the co-pilot was "not known by us" to have any links to extremism or terrorism. Analysis: Richard Westcott, BBC transport correspondent The focus now moves from the mechanics to the man flying the plane. An accident expert has told me the investigators will pore over the co-pilot's background and that of his family too. Did he owe money? Was there a grudge? They'll look at his religion, whether he was in trouble with the law, whether he had a stable love life. This kind of event is rare but it has happened before, although the reasons vary widely. After 9/11, they made cockpits impregnable. It keeps the terrorists out, but in the end it also allows someone to keep their colleagues out too. Airlines have to make a call. Which is the bigger threat - terrorism or suicide? Passengers were not aware of the impending crash "until the very last moment" when screams could be heard, Mr Robin said, adding that they died instantly. After Thursday's revelations, several airlines have pledged to change their rules to ensure at least two crew members are present in the cockpit at all times. Meanwhile, relatives and friends of the victims travelled to the Alpine region where the plane came down, near the town of Seyne-les-Alpes. The disclosure of the likely cause of the crash has provoked anger. "One person can't have the right to end the lives of hundreds of people and families," Esteban Rodriguez, a Spanish factory worker who lost two friends aboard the aircraft, told the Associated Press news agency. The principal of a German high school that lost 16 pupils and two teachers in the crash said the latest news was "much, much worse than we had thought". The second "black box" - that records flight data - has still not been found. Other incidents thought to be caused by deliberate pilot action Source: Aviation Safety Network
The boat was seized on Saturday near Japan's Kagoshima Prefecture, China's Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Chinese consulate in Fukuoka, Japan. The captain had admitted entering Japanese waters, Xinhua said. The incident comes months after anti-Japanese protests in Chinese cities over disputed islands near Taiwan. The captain and two crew members have been taken to Kagoshima for questioning while six other sailors remained on board the boat, which comes from Fujian province in south-east China, Xinhua said. A Chinese consulate official has been sent to Kagoshima to visit the crew members, the report added. Relations between Japan and China have been strained over the disputed islands, known as the Diaoyu in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese. Japan controls the islands, which are also claimed by Taiwan. Close to strategically important shipping lanes, the waters around the islands also offer rich fishing grounds and are thought to contain oil deposits.
The president tweeted to say he would allow the release "subject to receipt of further information". The files are scheduled to be opened by the US National Archives on 26 October, but the president is entitled to extend their classified status. Kennedy was shot dead by a sniper on 22 November 1963 in Dallas, Texas. The National Archives has already released most documents related to the assassination but a final batch remains under lock and key. "Subject to the receipt of further information, I will be allowing, as President, the long blocked and classified JFK FILES to be opened," Trump said in a tweet. Congress ruled in 1992 that all JFK documents should be released within 25 years, unless the president decided the release would harm national security. The archive contains more than 3,000 previously unreleased documents, and more than 30,000 that have been released before but with redactions. It is unclear whether Mr Trump intends to allow the release in full or with redactions. Kennedy assassination experts do not think the last batch of papers contains any bombshells, according to a Washington Post report. But the files may shed more light on Lee Harvey Oswald's activities in Mexico City just months before the assassination. Oswald was arrested in Dallas on the day of the shooting and charged with the president's murder. He denied the charges, claiming he was a "just a patsy". He was gunned down by nightclub owner Jack Ruby while in police custody two days later, and the plot to kill Kennedy became the most powerful conspiracy theory in American history. "The American public deserves to know the facts, or at least they deserve to know what the government has kept hidden from them for all these years," Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics and author of a book about Kennedy, told the Associated Press news agency.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Tokyo "cannot accept" China's development near the area. The construction is in China's area, but Japan is concerned China would be able to siphon gas from its side. A co-operation agreement between the countries had broken down amid confrontation over disputed territory. The economic zones of both countries overlap at the gas field which the two countries claim exclusive excavation rights to. They had agreed in 2008 that Japanese companies would invest in the area, but the agreement eventually stalled. Tokyo now says a vessel has been spotted drilling a platform on the Chinese side about 26km (16 miles) from the disputed gas field. "Our position remains that we cannot accept China's unilateral development in this region where Japan's and China's claims overlap, while delimitation in East China Sea remains undefined," Mr Suga said. "We have conveyed to China our serious concern about the activities of the crane vessel. We told them, through diplomatic channels, we cannot accept it," he said. China has yet to respond to Japan's concerns. The two countries have been locked in an ongoing row over disputed territories and waters, especially over islands known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China. Japan controls the islands and sparked anger in China when it bought three of them from their private Japanese owner late last year.
By Alex Strangwayes-BoothReligious affairs reporter, BBC News And a quarter of 358 local authorities responding to the BBC said they would have no more room for burials within a decade. Cemetery experts warned of a looming "crisis", while managers called for a change in law to allow graves that are more than 75-years-old to be reused. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said the issue was "under constant review". BBC Local Radio approached 699 local authorities - 358 of which responded. Many of the councils surveyed, including those in Gosport, Mole Valley, Crawley and Rother, said they had five years or less before they ran out of room. Other areas - such as Tandridge district council in the South East - said they had already run out of space. Some 44% said they had 20 years or less before burial space ran out. About 74% of people who died in 2012 in the UK were cremated, but the cremation rates have levelled off - and there is still a demand for full burial and burial of ashes. 'Critical situation' Although local authorities in larger areas such as Sheffield and Oxford expressed concern about dwindling cemetery space, some of the worst-hit areas were small rural councils. Among them was the town of Bicester in Oxfordshire, which is due to double in size over the next 10 years with the development of 12,000 houses. Bicester's cemetery manager Chris Johnson said: "The situation is critical now. We're getting to two years of burials remaining so we are desperate to find other means - other land for a new cemetery ground". He said officials faced having to encroach on a nearby sports field to make room. Elsewhere in the area, cemeteries have had to dig up their car parks and paths to cope with demand. The BBC's religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott said pressure on cemetery space meant people faced having to buy plots away from their home towns and families. Bereaved relatives in Tandridge in Surrey have had problems with burial space for a long time. Peter Wyre, from Caterham, lost his wife Susan nearly three years ago and was initially told he would not be able to bury her in the local graveyard. Speaking to the BBC, he said he had been devastated by the news: "I was gutted, absolutely distraught. I mean if I wasn't upset already I was completely on the floor at that point. Just pure desperation because I knew that that's what she wanted." However, he was able to bury his wife locally in the end: "They clearly understood that I was upset. And right on the 11th hour of Christmas Eve I had a call from the undertakers to say, 'look, we've called in a favour and spoken to various individuals and we have a place.'" No decisions Dr Julie Rugg, of the University of York's cemetery research unit, said the situation was "desperate" and called on the government to intervene. She said the findings of the survey suggested "for the first time how desperate the problem is right across the country". "It's not just a London or a big town problem. Even small parish councils are wondering how they are going to cope when land runs out," she said. "I don't know how much more evidence there needs to be on the table before the Ministry of Justice appreciates that this is a crisis." The MoJ is responsible for burial law. Local authorities are not legally bound to carry out burials but they are required to dispose of the dead. In response to the findings, a spokesman for the MoJ said: "Any changes in the way in which graves and cemeteries might be managed need to be considered carefully and sensitively. "We keep this area under constant review and no decisions have yet been taken." Grave re-use However, some have called for a change in grave use policy. Tim Morris, from the Institute of Cemetery and Crematoria Management, said: "Money needed to build new cemeteries could be saved, and spent on the living, through the re-use of graves," he said. He said such a move would involve lifting out remains from graves that are more than 75-years-old, burying them deeper in the same grave and then re-using the space on top. A 2007 law permits this in London cemeteries but does not yet apply to the rest of England. The City of London Cemetery, which is run by the City of London Corporation, is the only cemetery preparing to "lift and deepen". Gary Burks, superintendent of the cemetery, said: "I believe that is achievable and acceptable. And I feel that it's appropriate for the world we live in.
Mr Varoufakis said Greece was subject to a programme that will "go down in history as the greatest disaster of macroeconomic management ever". The German parliament approved the opening of negotiations on Friday. The bailout could total €86bn (£60bn) in exchange for austerity measures. In a damning assessment, Mr Varoufakis told the BBC's Mark Lobel: "This programme is going to fail whoever undertakes its implementation." Asked how long that would take, he replied: "It has failed already." Mr Varoufakis resigned earlier this month, in what was widely seen as a conciliatory gesture towards the eurozone finance ministers with whom he had clashed frequently. He said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has admitted that he does not believe in the bailout, had little option but to sign. "We were given a choice between being executed and capitulating. And he decided that capitulation was the optimal strategy." Mr Tsipras has announced a cabinet reshuffle, sacking several ministers who voted against the reforms in parliament this week. But he opted not to bring in technocrats or opposition politicians as replacements. As a result, our correspondent says, Mr Tsipras will preside over ministers who, like himself, harbour serious doubts about the reform programme. Greece must pass further reforms on Wednesday next week to secure the bailout. Germany was the last of the eurozone countries needing parliamentary approval to begin the talks. But the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has warned that the process will not be easy, saying he expected the negotiations to take four weeks. On Saturday, the Greek government ordered banks to open on Monday following three weeks of closures. But the decree stated that the weekly withdrawal limit should be a maximum €420. Separately, the European Council approved the €7bn bridging loan for Greece from an EU-wide emergency fund. The loan was approved in principle by eurozone ministers on Thursday and now has the go-ahead from all non-euro states. It means Greece will now be able to repay debts to two of its creditors, the ECB and International Monetary Fund (IMF), due on Monday.
Luxury items worth more than £1m were stolen by the thieves, who targeted hundreds of homes then shipped some of the goods out of the country. Police disrupted the gang by tracking vehicles used in several burglaries. The Met has arrested 36 men in the past eight months, while another 39 have been held by other forces. The investigation, known as Operation Genie, started following a spate of burglaries in south-west London and Surrey in 2017. Handbags, jewellery and watches Detectives tracked vehicles used by the suspects and found burglars would normally commit offences within a week of flying into the country. The gang carefully selected the homes they targeted, picking properties which were often empty and on the edges of parks or golf courses. The burglars would climb into the first floor using low roofs or garden furniture, avoiding alarms on the ground floor and then take items including designer clothes, handbags, jewellery and watches. Of the men held in London, 16 have been convicted of burglary-related offences, and of the remaining 20, eight have been deported. Twelve of the others left the UK after being released under investigation. Other suspects were also held in Hertfordshire, Surrey and Sussex. Det Insp Tim Court, who co-ordinated the investigation, said offenders had "come to London with the intention of carrying out burglaries". "I would like to thank the Chilean Embassy, which has provided a great deal of support in helping to identify the people responsible for these crimes," he added.
The celebrated singer, who died in January aged 69, is joined by Adele, Calvin Harris, Coldplay and Jess Glynne on the five-strong shortlist. Adele was named British artist of the year in 2015, one of the two awards she won at last year's event. This year's awards, to be broadcast live on BBC One, will be held at the ExCel in London on 12 December. Bowie's nomination follows his surprise omission from the album of the year shortlist announced last month. Blackstar, his final release, had been tipped for inclusion but was shut out by Rick Astley's 50, Adele's 25 and three other titles. Kaiser Chiefs, Craig David, John Legend and Robbie Williams are among the performers at this year's ceremony. It was announced last week that pop singer Izzy Bizu will be crowned BBC Introducing artist of the year at the event. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

A prolific author, Mo has published dozens of short stories, with his first work published in 1981. The Swedish Academy praised his work which "with hallucinatory realism merges folk tales, history and the contemporary". The 57-year-old is the first Chinese resident to win the prize. Chinese-born Gao Xingjian was honoured in 2000, but is a French citizen. Mo is the 109th recipient of the prestigious prize, won last year by Swedish poet Tomas Transtroemer. Presented by the Nobel Foundation, the award - only given to living writers - is worth 8 million kronor (£741,000). "He has such a unique way of writing. If you read half a page of Mo Yan you immediately recognise it as him," said Peter Englund, head of the Academy. He said Mo had been told of the award, adding: "He was at home with his dad. He said he was overjoyed and terrified." Born Guan Moye, the author writes under the pen name Mo Yan, which means "don't speak" in Chinese. He began writing while a soldier in the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and received international fame in 1987 for Red Sorghum: A Novel of China. Made into a film which won the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival in 1988, the novella was a tale of the brutal violence in the eastern China countryside, where he grew up, during the 1920s and 1930s. Favouring to write about China's past rather than contemporary issues, the settings for Mo's works range from the 1911 revolution, Japan's wartime invasion and Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. "He has a very impressive oeuvre," Michel Hockx, Professor of Chinese at the University of London, said. "He has a large readership and he addresses the human condition in a way in which the Nobel Committee likes to see." Mo's other acclaimed works include Republic of Wine, Life And Death Are Wearing Me Out and Big Breasts and Wide Hips. The latter book caused controversy when it was published in 1995 for its sexual content and depicting a class struggle contrary to the Chinese Communist Party line. The author was forced by the PLA to withdraw it from publication although it was pirated many times. After it was translated into English a decade later, the book won him a nomination for the Man Asian Literary Prize. Despite his social criticism Mo is seen in his homeland as one of the foremost contemporary authors, however critics have accused him of being too close to the Communist Party. "A writer should express criticism and indignation at the dark side of society and the ugliness of human nature," the author said in a speech at the Frankfurt Book Fair in 2009. "Some may want to shout on the street, but we should tolerate those who hide in their rooms and use literature to voice their opinions." His latest novel, Frog, about China's "one child" population control policy, won the Mao Dun Literature Prize - one of his country's most prestigious literature prizes - last year. Mo and the other Nobel laureates for medicine, physics, chemistry and peace, will receive their prizes at formal ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo on 10 December - the anniversary of the death of prize creator Alfred Nobel in 1896.
By Joe MillerBusiness reporter Data from IHS Markit's Purchasing Managers' Index, or PMI, shows a fall to 47.7 in July, the lowest level since April in 2009. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. Both manufacturing and service sectors saw a decline in output and orders. However, exports picked up, driven by the weakening of the pound. The report surveyed more than 650 services companies, from sectors including transport, business services, computing and restaurants. It asked them: "Is the level of business activity at your company higher, the same or lower than one month ago?" It also asked manufacturers whether production had gone up or down. The PMI is the first significant set of data measuring business reaction to the result of the UK referendum. Business Live: Pound tumbles Chancellor may 'reset' economic policy 'Record slump' Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit, said the downturn had been "most commonly attributed in one way or another to 'Brexit'." He added that the economy could contract by 0.4% in the third quarter of this year, but that would depend on whether the current slump continued. "The only other times we have seen this index fall to these low levels, was the global financial crisis in 2008/9, the bursting of the dot com bubble, and the 1998 Asian financial crisis," Mr Williamson told the BBC. "The difference this time is that it is entirely home-grown, which suggest the impact could be greater on the UK economy than before. "This is exactly what most economists were saying would happen." A subset of the PMI figures, shows that service companies, such as insurance or advertising, are feeling less positive about the future than at any time since the height of the recession. Analysis: Andrew Walker, BBC World Service economics correspondent The figures in PMI surveys are taken seriously by economists as early warning signs of what is in the pipeline. When there is a downturn, the PMIs generally tell the same story. So this is a troubling set of results. But it is just one month's worth. It is possible that this is a "shock-induced nadir", as the chief economist at the firm who conducted the survey put it, and that the economy will right itself in the coming months. In addition, the financial markets have stabilised and in some areas rebounded, in an adjustment after the vote that was described by the IMF as severe but generally orderly. That said, the survey results do increase the chances of some action from the Bank of England, perhaps an interest rate cut in August, or perhaps even some additional spending plans in the chancellor's Autumn Statement. 'Heading for recession' Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures provided the "first major evidence that the UK is entering a sharp downturn". Although he added that the "confidence shock from the Leave vote might wear off over the coming months". Neil Wilson, markets analyst at ETX Capital, said he thought the UK was "heading for a recession again", and that the data would almost certainly prompt the Bank of England to roll out further stimulus. The pound has fallen in response to the publication of the data. The UK's new chancellor, Philip Hammond, urged caution. "Let's be clear, the PMI data is a measure of sentiment, it's not a measure of any hard activity in the economy. "What it tells us is businesses confidence has been dented, they're not sure, they're in a period of uncertainty now." Earlier on Friday, Mr Hammond said that he might "reset" Britain's fiscal policy. 'No surprise' While IHS Markit's reading on the UK economy was worse than most analysts expected, its verdict on the wider eurozone economy was more cheery. Although business confidence dropped to an 18-month low, the overall pace of economic growth was in line with pre-Brexit trends, and employment across the eurozone rose. The optimistic outlook is in line with comments made by the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Mario Draghi, who said on Thursday that Europe's financial markets had "weathered" the uncertainty caused by the vote. Europe Economics' Andrew Lilico, who argued during the referendum campaign that leaving the EU would be beneficial for the UK in the long term, told the BBC the PMI data was "no surprise", and that it "doesn't tell us much about what Brexit's longer term impact will be". Mr Lilico said he always expected a short-term reaction, and those who voted to leave, "expected a short-term slowdown too". The downturn, he added, was "associated with risks in the global economy," as well as Brexit.
Michel Barnier said he was "not in the frame of mind to make concessions or ask for concessions". UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said talks got off to a "promising start". The UK appears to have conceded to the EU's preferred order for the talks which will mean trade negotiations do not begin immediately. Mr Davis and Mr Barnier gave a joint press conference after day one of the talks in Brussels. The initial focus will be on expat rights, a financial settlement and "other separation issues". Discussions aimed at preserving the Good Friday Agreement and common travel area in Ireland will also begin, although Mr Davis suggested these issues may not be settled until the end of the process, when the UK's trade relationship with the EU is settled. The UK had wanted talks on its future relationship with the EU to be considered from the outset, but Mr Barnier said this would only happen once the European Council decided "sufficient progress has been made" on the other issues. Mr Davis - who had predicted this would be the "row of the summer" - denied suggestions the agreed timetable showed Britain's "weakness" and insisted it was "completely consistent" with the government's aim of parallel trade and exit talks. "It's not when it starts it's how it finishes that matters," he said. Asked whether he had made any concessions to the UK in return, Mr Barnier said the UK had decided to leave the EU - not the other way around, and each side had to "assume our responsibility and the consequences of our decisions". "I am not in a frame of mind to make concessions, or ask for concessions," he said. "It's not about punishment, it is not about revenge. "Basically, we are implementing the decision taken by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and unravel 43 years of patiently-built relations. "I will do all I can to put emotion to one side and stick to the facts, the figures, and the legal basis, and work with the United Kingdom to find an agreement in that frame of mind." Who is in charge? Laura Kuennsberg, BBC political editor It's often compared to a divorce - the UK wanted to talk about who gets the house and the CD collection at the same time as settling who pays for the kids' weddings in 20 years' time. The EU on the other hand have been firm all along that the future arrangements could only be discussed once the terms of the initial split have been agreed. The debate was called "parallelism versus sequentialism" and from this afternoon's press conference and the announcement of the procedure it is clear that the UK has lost. Ministers believed they would be able to persuade the EU - the failure to do so has been described as a "total cave-in". The discussion was even predicted by Mr Davis as likely to be the "row of the summer". The row won't happen because it seems the UK has already given in. Read more from Laura Mr Barnier said a "fair deal" was possible "and far better than no deal". He promised to work with, not against, the UK. "We must lift the uncertainty caused by Brexit," he said. The two men - who exchanged gifts at the start of the talks - set out the structure for the initial negotiations. There will be one week of negotiations every month. Working groups of "senior experts" will be set up to focus on the three main areas. On citizens' rights, which the UK has said should be an immediate priority, Mr Davis said there was "much common ground". The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote. Prior to the start of talks, Mr Davis gave his counterpart a first edition of a mountaineering book - a French-language version of Regards vers Annapurna - while Mr Barnier reciprocated with a traditional, hand-carved walking stick from Savoie, complete with leather wrist strap. Who's who in the UK delegation? After holding talks with Theresa May in Downing Street, new Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said there must be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and economic borders must be "invisible". While he said he regretted Mrs May's decision to leave the single market and customs union, he said the two had a shared objective to minimise disruption to trade after the UK's exit. Earlier former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose, who chaired the Stronger In campaign last year, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was reassured that economic considerations were "top of the pile" but ministers needed to be realistic with the public. Speaking on the same programme, JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin - one of the leading pro-Leave business voices - said negotiators had to be open to possible compromises but also prepared to walk away and to default to World Trade Organization rules if necessary. "I don't think many people feel that staying in the single market and customs union and being subject to EU laws is Brexit. "I think Brexit is parliamentary sovereignty and an assertion of democracy. Outside that, I think there is a quite a lot of scope," Mr Martin said. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said there was "real confusion" about the government's mandate after the general election result.
Relations with Iran have been shaky since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. 20 August 2015 The British embassy in Tehran is expected to be reopened within days, during a visit to Iran by Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond and a delegation of business leaders. The move follows a deal agreed by Iran with six world powers on curbing its nuclear programme. The reopening of the embassy was first publicly proposed by the UK government last year, but had been held up by problems including Iran's reluctance to relax import laws which slowed the replacement of equipment taken out when the post was abandoned. 17 June 2014 British Foreign Secretary William Hague says the circumstances are right to reopen Britain's embassy in the Iranian capital Tehran. It follows an improvement in relations in recent months following the election of a more moderate president, Hassan Rouhani, in June 2013 and an agreement on how to deal with Iran's nuclear programme. It also comes as Iraqi forces are engaged in heavy clashes with Sunni Islamist militants across the country, amid reports that Iran is providing military assistance to its historic rival. 30 November 2011 Britain demands the immediate closure of the Iranian embassy in London, saying also that all Iranian diplomats must leave the country within 48 hours. Foreign Secretary William Hague also reveals that all UK diplomatic employees have already left Iran. 29 November 2011 Iranian protesters storm the UK embassy in Tehran, throwing stones, petrol bombs, and burning documents. They attempt to occupy it before being dispersed by riot police. The UK Foreign Office says it is "outraged" by the incident. 27 November 2011 The Iranian parliament votes to expel the British ambassador in Tehran, Dominick Chilcott. Economic and trade links with the UK are weakened. 21 November 2011 British Chancellor George Osborne announces financial sanctions against Iran as a result of a report by the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), into its nuclear programme. Britain ceases all ties with Iranian banks. November 2010 Four people said by Iran to be terrorists with links to Britain are arrested according to the country's English language television station Press TV. The Foreign Office denied the men had ties to Britain and said this was "another in a long line of slurs against the United Kingdom from the government of Iran". September 2009 Iran admits it is building a uranium enrichment plant near Qom, but insists it is for peaceful purposes. British intelligence services played a key role in the unveiling of the site. 19 June 2009 Mass protests are held after the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The opposition says the election was fraud. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says "arrogant powers" in the US and European countries tried to encourage protests. He adds that the "most evil of those powers was Britain". The British media was also criticised. January 2009 The British Council, which has been operating intermittently in Iran since 1961, says it has suspended operations in Tehran, claiming Iranian officials "pressurised" their staff. December 2008 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad delivers Channel 4's alternative Christmas message to Britain. July 2008 In a speech to the Israeli parliament, Gordon Brown says: "Iran has a clear choice to make: suspend its nuclear programme and accept our offer of negotiations or face growing isolation and the collective response not of one nation but of many nations." March 2007 Iran detains 15 British navy personnel who were patrolling the Shatt al-Arab waterway separating Iran and Iraq. Tehran says that the boat entered Iranian waters. A diplomatic row ensues and they are released on 4 April. June 2004 The UK, Germany and France draft a resolution for the IAEA criticising Iran's lack of co-operation with inspections of its nuclear programme. Later in the month, eight British sailors are held for three days in Iran after their ship reportedly strays into Iranian waters near the border with Iraq. May 2004 Demonstrations take place outside the UK embassy in Tehran, as people criticise the UK and US military for fighting near the Shia holy cities of Iraq. September 2003 The IAEA reports for the first time on Iran's 18-year nuclear programme. Iran insists it is for civilian purposes only but some parts of the international community, particularly the US and UK, believe that Iran is intent on building a nuclear weapon. In November 2003, Tehran agrees to more extensive inspection of its nuclear facilities by the IAEA. February 2002 Iran rejects David Reddaway as the UK's ambassador to Tehran, calling him a spy. 21 September 2001 Jack Straw becomes the first UK foreign secretary to travel to Iran since the Islamic revolution. It is part of a wider effort to forge a coalition against the Afghan Taliban. February 2001 Cabinet minister Mo Mowlam visits Iran and pledges UK assistance in Iran's fight against narco-trafficking from Afghanistan, which supplies 90% of the heroin sold in the UK. 1999 UK and Iran exchange ambassadors for the first time since the revolution in 1979. September 1998 Relations with Britain are restored to ambassador level after Tehran officially distances itself from the Salman Rushdie affair whereby it called the British author's book the Satanic Verses blasphemous against Islam and said Muslims had a duty to kill Mr Rushdie. It now says it would not carry out the fatwa nor encourage anyone else to do so. 1992 An Iranian diplomat is expelled in retaliation for Tehran's expulsion of a UK diplomat. Later, three Iranians are expelled from London (two embassy officials and a student) after an alleged plot to kill Mr Rushdie. 1991 Diplomatic relations with the UK improve with the release of Terry Waite, who was held hostage by an Iranian-backed militant group in Lebanon for almost five years. Iran is perceived to have been instrumental in securing Mr Waite's release. February 1989 Iran declares a fatwa on Mr Rushdie. Bilateral diplomatic ties are broken, and Mr Rushdie goes into hiding. 1988 British embassy in Tehran reopens. 30 April - 5 May 1980 Six anti-Khomeini Iranian gunmen take over the Iranian embassy in London and take 22 people hostage. The siege ends when British special forces soldiers storm the building, killing five of the gunmen. Nineteen hostages are set free but one dies and two are injured after the gunmen open fire on them during the assault. 1979 Britain closes its embassy in Tehran, following the Islamic revolution. 1955 CENTO, the Central Treaty Organisation, is formed under the Baghdad Pact by the UK, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and Turkey to offset Soviet influence in the region. Like Nato, it pledges mutual co-operation and non-interference in each others' internal affairs. The US joins the pact in 1958. CENTO is a largely symbolic body and disbands in 1979. 1953 Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh is ousted in a coup sponsored by US and British intelligence agencies. He serves a three year jail sentence for treason and spends the remainder of his life under house arrest until his death in 1967. 1950 Mossadegh is appointed prime minister after Ali Razamara is assassinated. In 1951 he tries to nationalise the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, but Britain imposes an embargo and appeals to the US for help. 1941 Iran says it will remain neutral in World War II but Reza Shah, the first Pahlavi king, had also expanded trade and links with Nazi Germany in the 1930s. Fearful of the outcome, especially after German incursion into the Soviet Union in 1941, the UK and Russia jointly occupy Iran and force Reza Shah to abdicate. He later dies in exile. UK and Russian troops leave Iran in 1946 after US officials cite clauses in the 1942 Atlantic Charter prohibiting colonial expansion on the back of wartime efforts.
By Danny VincentBBC News, Hong Kong "No matter what happens I don't want to take the sickness back to Africa," he said from his university dormitory, where he is now under a 14-day quarantine. He was suffering from a fever, a dry cough, and flu-like symptoms. When he became ill he thought of his time as a child in Cameroon when he contracted malaria. He feared the worse. "When I was going to the hospital for the first time I was thinking about my death and how I thought it was going to happen," he said. For 13 days he remained in isolation in a local Chinese hospital. He was treated with antibiotics and drugs typically used to treat HIV patients. After two weeks of care he began to show signs of recovery. The CT scan showed no trace of the illness. He became the first African person known to be infected with the deadly coronavirus and the first to recover. His medical care was covered by the Chinese state. Egypt has become the first country in Africa to confirm a case of the coronavirus. Health professionals warn that countries with weaker health systems may struggle to cope with a potential outbreak of the illness, which has led to more than 1,770 deaths and infected more than 72,000 people, mostly in China. "I don't want to go home before finishing studying. I think there is no need to return home because all hospital fees were taken care of by the Chinese government," says Mr Senou. To evacuate or not? Since late January governments around the world, led by the US, began evacuating their citizens out of Wuhan and neighbouring cities. But thousands of African students, workers and families, remain in lockdown across the central Hubei province - the outbreak began in the provincial capital Wuhan - and some think their governments should do more to help them. "We are sons and daughters of Africa but Africa is not willing to come to our rescue when we need it the most," says Tisiliyani Salima, a medical student at Tongji Medical University and president of the Zambian Wuhan student association. Learn more about the new virus For close to a month Ms Salima has been living in self-quarantine. Time has begun to lose meaning for the 24-year old student. She spends her days sleeping and checking updates on Chinese social media apps. She acts as the liaison between her embassy and the 186 Zambian students living under quarantine in Wuhan. Many worry about food safety, supplies, and lack information in a city that this week has seen an average of 100 deaths a day. She watched other international classmates evacuated from the city while her countrymen and women were left behind. "South of the Sahara most African countries have had a similar response," says one student who agreed to talk under the condition of anonymity. "Publicly or privately African countries say that China can handle the situation. But the situation is not under control. When you listen to the official response it tells you that the African countries do not want to offend China. We don't have the bargaining power," the student says. China is currently Africa's largest trading partner and the ties between the two have blossomed in recent years. In the process China has become home to 80,000 African students, many attracted to the middle kingdom by scholarship programmes. But community leaders say families, young and old are stranded in Hubei province with little aid or assistance from their governments. "People are saying: 'Don't bring us back because Nigeria can't handle us.' I feel conflicted but at the end of the day I am also human," says Angela, a recent graduate from Nigeria, who only gave her first name. "I would appreciate if they would recognise that there are Nigerians here but we don't seem to be a priority. We didn't get any response from our government," she says. Last week, for the first time in 22 days in lockdown, dwindling supplies forced Angela to venture out of her apartment to buy some essentials. "The city is like a ghost town. When I left my complex I didn't know if I would even be allowed back in. People are checking temperatures outside the gate," she says in a phone interview from her apartment. On 30 January the Cameroonian community penned an open letter to the president urging their government to evacuate citizens stuck in the epicentre of the outbreak. Weeks on Dr Pisso Scott Nseke, a community leader in Wuhan, says Cameroonians are still waiting for a response. He accepts that the community is not united in the desire to be evacuated but says they are disappointed by the lack of assistance from the government. As of mid-February, Egypt, Algeria, Mauritius, Morocco and Seychelles had moved their citizens out of Hubei province. Other nations such as Ghana and Kenya are reportedly considering evacuating. 'We feel abandoned' Some nations have sent financial support to their citizens. According to the head of the Ivory Coast student association in Wuhan $490 ($380) was given to the 77 Ivoirians in the city following weeks of discussions with their government. But many are growing increasingly frustrated by their government's stance. Ghana has reportedly sent financial assistance to its nationals as well. "Staying here doesn't guarantee our safety. We are just in a country that has better medical facilities," says Ms Salima. "We feel abandoned. The Chinese clearly were angered by the Americans pulling their people out as they felt it caused panic," said one student who agreed to talk on the condition of anonymity. "There is a lot of distrust here of the authorities," he added. Some are calling for a continent-wide strategy to help African nationals in China. "The decision to evacuate is not a question of 'solidarity' with China or the lack of it. It is the responsibility of every country to ultimately look after the health of their citizens wherever they are, including in China," says Hannah Ryder from Development Reimagined, a Beijing-based international development consultancy. As for Mr Senou, he says has no plans to return to Cameroon. "It would be a bad and dangerous idea. The biggest fear I had from the virus was psychological and emotional. Going back home is not an option now."
If confirmed by the Senate, she would be the first woman ever to hold the post. She was among several women chosen for top economic positions. The Biden transition team said others were set to break racial barriers if confirmed. Mr Biden has pledged to build a diverse administration. He earlier appointed an all-female senior press team. His transition team said his picks for senior economic roles would help "lift America out of the current economic downturn and build back better". Mr Biden has also announced the formation of a Presidential Inaugural Committee ahead of his swearing-in on 20 January. The committee will be responsible for organising inauguration-related activities. Also on Monday, Mr Biden got his first look at the daily presidential intelligence briefing as president-elect. The overview of national security threats to the US is usually offered as a courtesy to incoming White House administrations, but was initially withheld as Mr Trump refused to concede victory. Who is Janet Yellen? Ms Yellen had been widely tipped for the nomination in media reports prior to Monday's announcement. The 74-year-old economist has served as head of America's central bank and as a top economics adviser to former President Bill Clinton. She is credited with helping steer the economic recovery after the 2007 financial crisis and ensuing recession. As chair of the US Federal Reserve, Ms Yellen was known for focusing more attention on the impact of the bank's policies on workers and the costs of America's rising inequality. Mr Trump bucked Washington tradition when he opted not to appoint Ms Yellen to a second four-year term at the Fed. Starting with Bill Clinton in the 1990s, presidents kept on bank leaders appointed by their predecessors in an effort to de-politicise the bank. Since leaving the bank in 2018, Ms Yellen has spoken out about climate change and the need for Washington to do more to shield the US economy from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In a tweet following Monday's announcement, Ms Yellen said: "We face great challenges as a country right now. To recover, we must restore the American dream - a society where each person can rise to their potential and dream even bigger for their children. "As Treasury Secretary, I will work every day towards rebuilding that dream for all." President of the European Central Bank Christine Lagarde praised Mr Biden's choice, writing in a tweet: "Her intelligence, tenacity and calm approach make Janet a trailblazer for women everywhere." Republican Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee Chuck Grassley said that he expects Ms Yellen to "get a favourable view" during confirmation hearings before his committee. What about the other names? Biden transition officials said the senior economic team is set to include "several historic trailblazers". Picks include former Obama administration official Wally Adeyemo as deputy treasury secretary and economist Cecilia Rouse as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. If confirmed, Mr Biden's team said both would be the first African Americans in those roles. Mr Biden will nominate Neera Tanden, who worked with the Obama administration on the creation of Obamacare, to head the Office of Management and Budget. If confirmed, she would be the first woman of colour and first South Asian American to lead the agency. But she is likely to be at the centre of the hardest confirmation fight in the Senate. Critics have found tweets by her from four years ago, in which she appeared to stoke debunked conspiracy theories that Russian hackers changed votes in the 2016 election in favour of Mr Trump. On Monday, the Biden campaign also trumpeted its all-female press team, prompting the Trump White House to point out that its press team has been led by women since 2017, even if some of the lower-level aides are men. Neera Tanden pick draws controversy Joe Biden might have his first big presidential appointment fight on his hands. The president-elect's choice of Neera Tanden, a longtime Democratic operative, to be his White House budget office director - which requires Senate confirmation - is getting sharp attacks from the left and the right. Grass-roots liberals don't like Tanden because of her outspoken criticism of the party's progressive movement and its standard-bearer, former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders. Conservatives don't like her because of her personal jabs at their leaders. And Tanden's views are well-documented, given that some of her most incendiary comments came on social media. Concern about problematic tweets might seem quaint after four years of Donald Trump's presidency, of course. And the Senate's 2018 confirmation of Ric Grenell - a notorious Twitter provocateur - to be Trump's ambassador to Germany suggests that inflammatory social media posts are not by themselves disqualifying. Grenell, however, had a Republican majority supporting his nomination. Pending the outcome of Georgia's Senate races, Biden could face a chamber controlled by the opposition - and a left flank disinclined to help. Biden has touted his ability to work with the Senate to get things done. If he wants Tanden, this will be an early test of his skills. What's the latest with the election aftermath? Monday's nominations came as Arizona and Wisconsin officially certified Mr Biden's victory. President Donald Trump is expected to issue legal challenges to the vote in both states. At the Trump campaign's request, a second recount is due to be completed by Wednesday in another state where Mr Biden was declared the winner, Georgia. On Monday, Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said those trying to overturn the election results in the state were "dishonest actors" spreading "massive amounts of disinformation". He added: "There are those who are exploiting the emotions of many Trump supporters with fantastic claims, half-truths, misinformation and, frankly, they're misleading the president as well, apparently." The Trump campaign is also mounting legal challenges to Mr Biden's victories in Michigan and Nevada. The campaign has seen other lawsuits it filed dismissed in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Arizona and Michigan. You might be interested in:
"We no longer have a position with Apple," he told CNBC. Reports say Mr Icahn made $2bn (£1.4bn) from selling his stake in Apple. At one point last year, he owned 53 million shares worth $6.5bn. He blamed China's economic slowdown and worries over government interference for selling out of Apple. In March China passed a law that required all content shown in China to be stored on servers based on the Chinese mainland. As a result Apple's iBooks and iTunes movies service were shut down in the country. Apple said it hoped access to the services would be restored soon. Earlier this week, Apple reported in a 13% drop in its second quarter revenue as sales of iPhones slipped. Mr Icahn started buying Apple shares in the third quarter of 2013 when they were trading at about $68 a share. Shares closed down 3% to $94.83 on Thursday and have shed 27% in the past 12 months. Cook 'sorry' Mr Icahn said he spoke to Apple chief executive Tim Cook to tell him about the share sale. "I called him this morning to tell him that, and he was a little sorry, obviously. But I told him it's a great company," he said. The stock sale has not been disclosed in a filing to the stock regulator. Mr Icahn is the majority shareholder in Icahn Enterprises - a holding company with a range of investments, with interests ranging from mining to automotive to real estate and food packaging.
The London schoolgirls were smuggled into Syria from Turkey four or five days ago, the BBC understands. Sources suggest the girls entered Syria near the Kilis border crossing. Bethnal Green Academy pupils Shamima Begum and Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, travelled to Istanbul on 17 February. They flew from Gatwick to Turkey after telling their parents they were going out for the day. The Metropolitan Police said it "now had reason to believe that they are no longer in Turkey and have crossed into Syria". "Officers continue to work closely with the Turkish authorities on this investigation," the force said in a statement. 'Out of reach' Sources inside Syria suggest three girls who were identified as British - including one said to be wearing glasses - crossed the border with the help of people smugglers. The news comes after the girls' families made a number of emotional appeals for them to return. BBC correspondent James Reynolds said it was "not clear what - if anything - British or Turkish authorities are now able to do". He said the fear was that once inside Syria, the missing schoolgirls would be "out of reach". Ross Frenett, from the think tank the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said the girls' long-term prospects were concerning. "It seems likely they're going to get married pretty quickly and then probably settle into some kind of domestic life," he said. "The worry is more what happens in the long term, because as [Islamic State] tends to lose territory, this idea of just settling down and helping it from the back end won't necessarily work any more. Turkish criticism "We could see women taking a more active role in this conflict and that's a real worry here." Earlier, Scotland Yard denied it had taken three days to inform officials in Turkey about the schoolgirls travelling to Syria. Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said officials would have taken "necessary measures" had they known earlier. But the Met has said it began working with Turkish authorities a day after the girls went missing. Mr Arinc said: "It is a condemnable act for Britain to let three girls... come to Istanbul and then let us know three days later. "They haven't taken the necessary measures. The search is ongoing. "It would be great if we can find them. But if we can't, it is not us who will be responsible, but the British." 'Great assistance' Scotland Yard said officers made contact with the foreign liaison officer at the Turkish Embassy in London on 18 February - the day after the girls left the UK. "Since then we have been working closely with the Turkish authorities who are providing great assistance and support to our investigation," a spokesman added. A public appeal for information about the missing girls was launched by police on Friday, three days after the girls boarded their flight to Turkey. UK police officers have also travelled to Turkey - although their role in the country has not been confirmed. The three girls had been studying for their GCSEs at the school in Tower Hamlets, east London - where they have been described as "straight-A students". A fourth girl from the school is believed to have travelled to Syria in December. Bethnal Green Academy principal Mark Keary said there was no evidence they had been radicalised at school.
By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter It was no ordinary crime. The hitchhiker in question was a little robot called Hitchbot. The "death" raised an interesting question about human-robot relationship - not so much whether we can trust robots but whether the robots can trust us. The answer, it seems, was no. Hitchbot has now been rebuilt, at Ryerson University, in Toronto, where it was conceived. Its story is perhaps the ultimate tale of robot destruction, made all the more poignant by the fact that it was designed to be childlike and entirely non-threatening. With pool noodles for arms and legs, a transparent cake container for a head, a white bucket as a body, and resting on a child's car seat to allow anyone picking it up to be able to transport it safely, it was cartoon-like. If a child designed a robot, it would probably look like Hitchbot. The team deliberately made it on the cheap - describing its look as "yard-sale chic". They were aware that it may come to harm. In order to qualify as a robot, it had to have some basic electronics - including a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver to track its journey, movements in its arms, and software to allow it to communicate when asked questions. It could also smile and wink. And, of course, it could move its thumb into a hitch position. "It was extremely important that people would trust it and want to help it out which is why we made it the size of a child," said Dr Frauke Zeller, who led the team with her husband, Prof David Smith. The adventure started well, with Hitchbot being picked up by an elderly couple and taken on a camping trip in Halifax, Nova Scotia, followed by a sightseeing tour with a group of young men. Next, it was a guest of honour at a First Nation powwow, where it was given a name that translates to "Iron Woman", assigning it a gender. The robot picked up thousands of fans along the way, many travelling miles to be the next person to give it a lift. Sometimes, the robot's GPS location had to be disabled so that those who took it home wouldn't be mobbed outside their houses. The robot certainly appealed and the team behind it were swamped with international press enquiries from the outset. Hitchbot was given its own social media accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and became an instant hit, gaining thousands of followers. "People began to decorate Hitchbot with bracelets and other jewellery. This little robot with its simple design triggered so much creativity in people. And that was one of the biggest takeaways of the experiment, that we should stop telling people what to do with technology," Dr Zeller said. But Hitchbot's adventure was about to come to an abrupt end. "One day we received images of Hitchbot lying in the street with its arms and legs ripped off and its head missing," Dr Zeller said. "It affected thousands of people worldwide. Hitchbot had become an important symbol of trust. It was very sad and it hit us and the whole team more than I would have expected." Now, the team behind it - from Ryerson and McMaster Universities - and have rebuilt Hitchbot, even though its head was never found. They missed having it around and had been inundated with requests for Hitchbot 2.0, although they have no plans for another road trip. BBC News joined Prof Smith and Dr Zeller to take Hitchbot 2.0 on one of its first outings, to the safety of a cafe next to the university. The robot was instantly recognised by passers-by, many of whom stopped to chat and take a Hitchbot selfie. All of them seemed overjoyed to see the robot back in one piece. The Ryerson/McMaster team is also working with Softbank's Pepper, an archetypal big-eyed childlike robot, on another test of the trust relationship with humans. Pepper will be used to talk with patients about skin cancer prevention. The theory is that patients will communicate more openly with Pepper than they would to a human carer and the robot is part of an experiment to see if robots can be used for the promotion of healthy behaviour. Beating up bots Hitchbot is not the first robot to meet a violent end. Dr Kate Darling, of Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), encouraged people to hit dinosaur robots with a mallet, in an workshop designed to test just how nasty we could be to a machine. She also conducted an experiment with small bug-like robots. Most people struggled to hurt the bots, found Dr Darling. "There was a correlation between how empathetic people were and how long it took them to hit a robot," she told BBC News, at her lab in Boston. "What does it say about you as a person if you are willing to be cruel to a robot. Is it morally disturbing to beat up something that reacts in a very lifelike way?" she asked. The reaction of most people was to protect and care for the robots. "One woman was so distressed that she removed the robot's batteries so that it couldn't feel pain," Dr Darling said. Prof Rosalind Picard, who heads up the Affective Computing Lab, also based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, thinks it comes down to human nature. "We are made for relationships, even us engineers, and that is such a powerful thing that we fit machines into that," she said. But while it is important that robots understand human emotions because it will be their job to serve us, it might not be a good idea to anthropomorphise the machines. "We are at a pivotal point where we can choose as a society that we are not going to mislead people into thinking these machines are more human than they are," Prof Picard told BBC News, at her lab. "We know that these machines are nowhere near the capabilities of humans. They can fake it for the moment of an interview and they can look lifelike and say the right thing in particular situations." "A robot can be shown a picture of a face that is smiling but it doesn't know what it feels like to be happy. "It can be given examples of situations that make people smile but it doesn't understand that it might be a smile of pain." But Prof Picard admitted it was hard not to develop feelings for the machines we surrounded ourselves with and confessed that even she had fallen into that trap, treating her first car "as if it had a personality". "I blinked back a tear when I sold it, which was ridiculous," she said. At her lab, engineers design robots that can help humans but do not necessarily look human. One project is looking at robots that could work in hospitals as a companion to children when their parents or a nurse is not available. And they are working on a robot that will be able to teach children but also show them how to cope with not knowing things. We may have to limit our emotional response to robots but it is important that the robots understand ours, according to Prof Picard. "If the robot does something that annoys you, then the machine should see that you are irritated and - like your dog - do the equivalent of putting down its tail, put its ears back and look like it made a mistake," she said. Killer robots Roboticist Prof Noel Sharkey also thinks that we need to get over our obsession with treating machines as if they were human. "People perceive robots as something between an animate and an inanimate object and it has to do with our in-built anthropomorphism," he told BBC News. "If objects move in a certain way, we think that they are thinking. "What I try and do is stop people using these dumb analogies and human words for everything. "It is about time we developed our own scientific language." To prove his point, at one conference he attended recently he picked up an extremely cute robotic seal, designed for elderly care, and started banging its head against a table. "People were calling me a monster," he said. Actually, Prof Sharkey is much more of a pacifist - and leads the campaign to ban killer robots, something he thinks is a far more pressing ethical issue in modern-day robotics. "These are not human-looking robots," he said. "I'm not talking about Terminators with a machine gun. "These weapons look like conventional weapons but are designed so that the machine selects its own target, which to me is against human dignity." Prof Sharkey listed some of the current projects he thought were crossing the line into unethical territory: And he has been working at the UN for the past five years to get a new international treaty signed that either bans the use of them or states that they can never be used without "meaningful human control" - 26 nations are currently signed up, including China.

The official is said to have acted as a CIA contact at the US embassy, reports say, in a scandal that has infuriated German politicians. A German intelligence official was arrested last week on suspicion of spying. An inquiry has also begun into a German defence ministry worker, reports said. "The representative of the US intelligence services at the embassy of the United States of America has been told to leave Germany," government spokesman Steffen Seibert said. Analysis by Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Washington Earlier this week the White House described the partnership between the US and Germany as one built on respect. But no-one likes to be spied on, especially when it's your friend doing the spying. This latest episode is yet another reminder of how American surveillance programmes are causing friction with allies. It's angered many in Germany, where the issue of snooping is historically a very sensitive one, and many are asking: "What? Again?" It wasn't too long ago, after all, that we heard the National Security Agency was spying on Chancellor Merkel's mobile phone. After a review into the surveillance programmes, President Obama promised the US wouldn't spy on its friends overseas. But despite requests to be included, Germany isn't part of a non-spying pact the US has with Britain, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. The White House will want to do all it can to repair any trust issues over this latest incident, so they can work together in other areas - for example, it needs German support for tougher sanctions against Russia over Ukraine. Analysis by Stephen Evans, BBC News, Berlin The request by the German government follows increasing frustration that it has failed to get US assurances that spying would cease on German citizens from Chancellor Merkel down. She was shocked to learn that her mobile phone conversations were secretly being monitored while President Obama was greeting her as a friend on his visit to Berlin. Chancellor Merkel has tried to maintain a balance between condemning America's actions but also maintaining cordial relations. Each revelation has made that balance harder to achieve. This matters because America needs German help on a range of issues from trying to get the world economy out of its difficulties, to finding united Western action on Russia, to dealing with the revelations emanating from Edward Snowden who is currently in Moscow but whom some German lawmakers want to invite to Berlin. The chairman of the Bundestag (parliament) committee overseeing the secret service said the action had been taken because of America's spying on German politicians and its failure to co-operate and provide adequate responses. The US has not denied allegations that a German intelligence agency employee arrested last week was passing secret documents to the US National Security Agency (NSA). However, the latest reports that an employee within the defence ministry was also spying for the US were considered more serious. Although no arrest was made, searches were carried out on Wednesday at the ministry and elsewhere. The US and Germany have been close allies for decades but relations were hit last year when it emerged that Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone had been monitored by the NSA. The White House declined to comment on the matter but said the security and intelligence relationship with Germany "is a very important one and keeps Germans and Americans safe". "It is essential that co-operation continue in all areas and we will continue to be in touch with the German government in appropriate channels," spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said. Timeline: Germany spy scandal October 2013: German Chancellor Angela Merkel calls US President Barack Obama after revelations that the US may have spied on her mobile phone June 2014: Germany announces an investigation into the claims 4 July 2014: A suspected US spy said to be working for the German intelligence agency is arrested 9 July 2014: A second case emerges as searches are carried out at the defence ministry 10 July 2014: German government orders expulsion of CIA official On Thursday, Mrs Merkel said spying on allies was a "waste of energy". "We have so many problems, we should focus on the important things," she said. "In the Cold War maybe there was general mistrust. Today we are living in the 21st Century. Today there are completely new threats." German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the information that the US appeared to have gained from the suspected espionage was "laughable" but the political damage was "disproportionate and serious". The scale of the US agency's surveillance was revealed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who fled the US and is now a fugitive in Russia. The German intelligence official arrested last week was alleged to have been trying to gather details about a German parliamentary committee investigating the NSA spying scandal. When Mrs Merkel visited the White House in May, President Barack Obama sought to assure her and the German people they were not subject to "continual surveillance" by the US. He said "complicated issues" were involved but he anticipated that the matter would be resolved to the satisfaction of both countries.
By Judith BurnsBBC News education reporter The pay gap persists even between men and women from the same types of university who studied the same subjects, suggests the study. Researchers for the Higher Education Careers Services Unit (Hecsu) analysed how much students who applied to higher education in 2006, earned last year. Jane Artess, of Hecsu, said pay distribution was "strikingly uneven". This was despite laws designed to ensure equal access to jobs and pay, said Ms Artess, The researchers analysed data from a longitudinal study of 17,000 recent graduates called Futuretrack. They found that the take-home pay of more than half of female graduates ranged between £15,000 and £23,999. Male lead Men were more likely to take home £24,000 and above, they found. The analysis did not include part-time workers or the unemployed. The data, published in the Hecsu journal Graduate Market Trends, suggested men earned more than women across all degree subject areas, even if more women took those subjects than men. "When graduate earnings are examined by subject, it is clear that women earned less than men who studied the same subject," says the article. The authors add this is the case across all subject areas, "even where women's participation is greater than men's". "Equal opportunity to access jobs and pay has been enshrined in legislation for 40 years, yet Futuretrack found that being female can make a difference to a graduate's earning power", said Ms Artess. "It is difficult to see why this is, for example, female graduates of media-related subjects are no more or less numerous than their male counterparts yet their earnings are typically lower. "Of the Futuretrack respondents, there were fewer men than women in law, yet there is an even greater male lead on earnings. "Since it would be unlawful for employers to pay males and females doing the same job differently, something else must be happening to female graduate earnings. "If we look at wages by sector, the male lead is persistent in the public and private sectors, in graduate workplaces and also in graduate and non-graduate job roles. "The only area where female pay is equal to males is in the not-for-profit sector," said Ms Artess. Trades Union Congress (TUC) general secretary Frances O'Grady described the findings as "very alarming." Motherhood penalty "We know that women pay a huge motherhood penalty, but this data suggests earnings disparities may be starting earlier. "More women are going to university and are better educated than ever before but are not getting the same reward when they leave as male graduates. "This research shows they are getting a raw deal for their talent." Heather Jackson, a businesswoman and author who advocates a better gender balance among senior managers, said the results were disappointing but unsurprising. Managers should take note that "a raft of research published over the last decade has shown that gender diversity and the right balance of talent can be a contributing factor to business performance, so there is a strong business case to ensure that we nurture female talent from the very start of their careers", said Ms Jackson. A government spokeswoman said that although the gender gap was closing, "it is still too large". "We have already made good progress towards ending pay discrimination," she said. "Measures in the Equality Act to make pay secrecy clauses unlawful have already been implemented. "We are also encouraging companies to sign up to Think, Act, Report, a voluntary initiative to improve gender equality at work, including reporting on pay and other work-place issues. "More than 70 companies have signed up, covering 1.3 million employees. "But for all this, pay inequality remains a stubborn obstacle to real fairness in the work-place. "We will continue to work with businesses to ensure that we do all we can to help them make the most of women's talents, and unlock their full potential." The Futuretrack project is carried out for Hecsu by Warwick University's Institute for Employment Research.
A number of people were injured, a spokesman for Eurotunnel said, without elaborating. Eurotunnel is facing a daily struggle with migrants who attempt to smuggle themselves into Britain, sometimes with fatal consequences. The latest incident caused serious delays to Eurotunnel train services. Passengers were held up for about an hour on the British side and 30 minutes on the French side on Tuesday, French news agency AFP reported. Meanwhile, the UK has agreed to provide an extra £7m ($10.9m) towards efforts to step up security at the Channel Tunnel railhead in Calais, Home Secretary Theresa May has announced. A spokesman for Eurotunnel said the migrants were trying to enter the site "between midnight and 6am", adding: "It was the biggest incursion effort in the past month and a half. "All our security personnel, that is nearly 200 people, as well as police were called in." Another Eurotunnel spokesman said: "There was some damage to our fences - which we'll have to repair - as they tried to board shuttles. Fortunately, there wasn't any damage to shuttles. Unfortunately, a number of people were injured. "It is an almost nightly occurrence - we're trying to run a travel business here." 'Human misery' Eight migrants have died this summer trying to reach Britain through the Channel Tunnel. There were delays to services last week when the body of a suspected migrant was found on the roof of a Eurotunnel train at the terminal in Folkestone, southern England. AFP says an official count at the beginning of July found that about 3,000 migrants - mainly from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Sudan and Afghanistan - were camping in Calais and trying to get across the Channel. French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve held talks in London on Tuesday with the UK home secretary on the migrant issue. Speaking after their meeting, Ms May said: "The French and UK governments are working in close collaboration and co-operation on this issue which affects us both. "We are both clear that we need to ensure we are dealing with the terrible criminal gangs, the people smugglers, who are making a profit out of the human misery of many people." Eurotunnel is seeking compensation from the British and French governments for disruption caused by illegal migrants.
By Preeti JhaBBC News When demonstrators in Bangkok held up umbrellas to shield themselves from tear gas fired for the first time last Friday, it was strikingly reminiscent of the anti-government protests that shook the Chinese territory last year. From helmets and gas masks to flashmobs and hand signals, Thailand’s student-led movement is drawing on the experience of Hong Kong’s young activists in its own fight for change. Here are three echoes of the Hong Kong protests in Thailand. Leaderless movement: 'We are all leaders today’ After the arrest of many of Thailand’s protest leaders last week, activists have changed tack. “They think arresting the leaders will stop us,” Pla, a 24-year-old demonstrator, told thousands of protesters at Bangkok’s Victory Monument on Sunday. “It’s no use. We are all leaders today.” The absence of a centralised leadership was a defining feature of the seven straight months of protests that rocked Hong Kong - and what many say sustained the movement for so long. While there were figureheads, decision-making was devolved with protesters commonly using online forums and the secure messaging app Telegram to organise - and gather in large numbers quickly. In Thailand the use of Telegram has skyrocketed in recent days. Protesters have used it to co-ordinate rallies since the government ban on political gatherings of more than four people was implemented last week. A group started by Free Youth, a key protest collective, reached the maximum 200,000 subscribers soon after it launched. Thai authorities have responded by ordering internet providers to block the app. While many Thais are joining Telegram as non-protesting observers, active members use the groups to strategise - from where protests should take place to updates on police whereabouts. Like the Hong Kong protesters, Thai activists have been putting decisions to a vote. On Monday the main Free Youth Facebook page asked supporters if they should take a break by hitting the “care” emoticon to pick a rest and the “wow” emoticon to protest. They decided to keep going. Thai protesters are now trying to "remain as flat as possible, making leadership open and replaceable", says Aim Sinpeng, a political scientist at the University of Sydney. "This is very different from past protests in Thailand that tended to be personalised around leaders who are often influential people." The use of the hashtag #everybodyisaleader has been growing on social media in recent days, an attempt to "re-pivot the movement... to protect itself from state persecution", says Dr Aim, whose research focuses on digital politics in South East Asia. A new language of protest: Hand signs and a 'jungle phone' Over the weekend a new language evolved on the streets of Bangkok. The building blocks were borrowed from Hong Kong. To signal they needed helmets, activists raised their hands in a triangle above their heads. By crossing their fingers they showed someone was injured. Swirling an index finger in an anti-clockwise direction was a warning to disperse. The savvy use of hand signals was first observed in Hong Kong where they became indispensable for protesters communicating across huge crowds. Thai activists have incorporated this language of signs as well as sprouting homegrown signals shared through infographics on social media. Since their loudspeakers were confiscated activists have also resorted to other innovative communication methods, says Wasana Wongsurawat, an associate professor of history at Chulalongkorn University. At a protest in Bangkok on Saturday she watched activists deploy what she describes as “a jungle telephone” to signal police arrivals or request equipment such as umbrellas for those on the protest frontlines. “Someone would shout ‘the water canons are coming’. Then people in the crowd started repeating the phrase. Within two minutes the message travelled from one end of the demonstration to the other,” Dr Wasana tells the BBC, adding the rally disbanded before the suspected equipment arrived. Beyond borders: #StandWithThailand While the Thai and Hong Kong protests are both rooted in unique local grievances, their activists see commonalities in their situations. In Thailand demonstrators are demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former coup leader who became premier last year after disputed elections. They are also urging reform of the country’s powerful monarchy, an unprecedented challenge to an institution shielded from criticism by law. In Hong Kong, activists have also sought the resignation of their leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, as they demand universal suffrage and protest against the rising influence of Beijing in the semi-autonomous territory’s affairs. In both places democracy campaigners have come to see their political struggles as shared in a new era of protests. Earlier this year they dubbed themselves the Milk Tea Alliance - a loose online coalition of activists from Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan - referring to the classic drink popular in all three places. Thai protest leaders have often said the Hong Kong movement has inspired them. And Hong Kong activists have expressed their solidarity, offering tips on protective protest wear, internet security and first aid. Prominent Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong regularly tweets in support of the Thai movement with the hashtag #StandWithThailand. Last week he wrote: “People should not be afraid of their governments. Only governments should be afraid of their people.” The new generation of protesters in Thailand and Hong Kong have stood out both for their youth and also their skill at harnessing modern technology. “The culture of protest in Thailand in 2020 is the culture of protest of internet natives,” says Dr Wasana, pointing to how adept the activists are at spreading their messages on social media. By borrowing from the Hong Kong playbook activists hope to sustain their movement. "There's no other example of high school and college kids fighting water cannons and tear gas for such a long period of time," the historian adds. The whole nature of protest is shifting across South East Asia, says Bridget Welsh, an honorary research associate at the University of Nottingham in Malaysia. Democracy activists in Thailand and Hong Kong, as well as countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia, are "adapting to growing authoritarianism in a globalised world" with fast-changing tactics that harness the power of technology and visual representation.

By Jen CopestakeTechnology reporter The Intercept, which revealed the existence of Project Dragonfly in August, says Google has been "forced to shut down a data analysis system it was using" to feed the project. And access to data "integral to Dragonfly... has been suspended for now, which has stopped progress". Google said it had no immediate plans to launch a Chinese search engine. What is The Intercept reporting? Citing internal Google documents and inside sources, the Intercept says Project Dragonfly began in the spring of 2017 and accelerated in December after Google's chief executive, Sundar Pichai, met a Chinese government official. An Android app with versions called Maotai and Longfei were developed and could be launched within nine months if Chinese government approved, it says. Using a tool called BeaconTower to check if users' search queries on Beijing-based website 265.com would fall foul of China's censors, Google engineers came up with a list of thousands of banned websites, including the BBC and Wikipedia, which could then be purged from the Dragonfly search engine. But members of Google's privacy team confronted the Dragonfly project managers, saying the system had "been kept secret from them". And after several discussions, "Google engineers were told that they were no longer permitted to continue using the 265.com data to help develop Dragonfly, which has since had severe consequences for the project". What are the issues with launching a search engine in China? The so-called great firewall of China is notorious for not allowing its citizens free access to all the content available on the internet. China has in the past two years imposed increasingly strict rules on foreign companies, including new censorship restrictions. Some Western sites are blocked outright, including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Certain topics such as the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989 are also completely blocked. References to political opposition, dissidents and anti-Communist activity are also banned as are those to free speech and sex. Any search engine in China would have to comply with the Chinese government's strict rules on censorship. Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter Even with this news today, I don't think Google's ambitions in China are over - just stalled. Sundar Pichai has clearly decided that China is too important (and lucrative) a market to pass up and so, while Dragonfly has met a significant bump in the road - thanks to its own privacy team, the company will almost certainly find a new approach to serving the Chinese market. But in doing so it might do serious harm to its brand. Now more than ever, US technology companies are under pressure to act in the interests of both America and Americans. Bowing to Beijing's demands with whatever Project Dragonfly morphs into will be a stain on Google's principles and its reputation. How advanced were the plans? We learned from Mr Pichai's recent appearance on Capitol Hill that more than 100 engineers had been working on the project at one point in time. When quizzed by lawmakers on the plans, he said: "Right now, we have no plans to launch in China." He said all efforts were "internal" and did not currently involve discussions with the Chinese government. In response to further questions, Mr Pichai said the company would be "fully transparent" with politicians if it released a search service in China. The BBC understands Project Dragonfly never reached the point of having a full and final privacy review by Google. A letter from more than 300 Google employees in November, co-signed by Amnesty International, asked the company to halt the project entirely. Why does Google want to get back into China? Quite simply, China is the biggest internet market in the world. Google launched a search engine in the authoritarian state in 2006, google.cn. Google was compliant with the Chinese government's censorship requirements at the time but the search company pulled the plug in 2010, citing increasing concerns about cyber-attacks on activists. Despite its main search engine and YouTube video platform being blocked, Google still has more than 700 employees and three offices in China and has been developing alternative projects. Its Google Translate app for smartphones was approved in China last year. It also invested in Chinese live-stream game platform Chushou in January and has launched an artificial intelligence game on the social media app WeChat.
The 21-year-old hanged his daughter, and then himself, at a deserted hotel in Phuket on Monday, reportedly after an argument with his wife. Facebook sent condolences to the family for the "appalling" incident and said that the content had now been removed. The company pledged a review of its processes after footage of a US killing stayed online for hours this month. The footage of the Thai killing had also been available on video sharing website YouTube, but the company took it down after the BBC alerted it to its presence. Social media anger Relatives of the Thai man, Wuttisan Wongtalay, saw the distressing footage and alerted the police - but the authorities arrived too late to save him and his daughter. In a statement, a Facebook spokesperson said: "This is an appalling incident and our hearts go out to the family of the victim. There is absolutely no place for content of this kind on Facebook and it has now been removed." Read more: Reuters said two videos were posted, at 16:50 (09:50 GMT) and 16:57 on Monday, and were taken down at about 17:00 on Tuesday, roughly 24 hours later. Facebook has yet to confirm the times to the BBC. Thailand's ministry of digital economy said it had contacted Facebook on Tuesday afternoon about removing the videos. Ministry spokesman Somsak Khaosuwan told Reuters: "We will not be able to press charges against Facebook, because Facebook is the service provider and they acted according to their protocol when we sent our request. They co-operated very well." YouTube said it had taken down the video within 15 minutes of being told of its presence by the BBC. Its statement read: "YouTube has clear policies that outline what's acceptable to post and we quickly remove videos that break our rules when they're flagged." Shortly before the BBC alerted YouTube, the video was showing 2,351 views. Thai social media users reacted with anger to the footage, while offering condolences to the family of the girl, BBC Thai editor Nopporn Wong-Anan says. Devastated relatives of the child, including the mother, picked up the body of the girl and her father from hospital on Tuesday. Following the US killing, Facebook said it was "constantly exploring ways that new technologies can help us make sure Facebook is a safe environment". "We prioritise reports with serious safety implications for our community, and are working on making that review process go even faster," blogged one of its executives last week. Separately on Tuesday, a court in Sweden jailed three men over the gang-rape of a woman in the city of Uppsala, 80km (50 miles) north of Stockholm, earlier this year and its live-streaming on Facebook. One man was jailed for two years and four months, and another for one year, both for rape. The third was jailed for six months for posting the rape on Facebook and failing to report it. Analysis: Leo Kelion, BBC technology desk editor This latest atrocity comes less than a fortnight after a US man bragged on Facebook Live about his murder of a 74-year-old man in Cleveland, having also posted a video of the killing to the social network. The platform's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, subsequently acknowledged he had "a lot of work" to do after it emerged the murder clip had remained online for more than two hours despite Facebook having received complaints in the meantime. Prior to that, Facebook Live broadcast the death of a Chicago man who was shot in the neck and head last June, and then in July a woman streamed the death of her boyfriend after he was shot by police in Minneapolis. There have also been reports of sexual assaults, animal abuse and teenage suicide having been shown. For its part, Facebook is trying to find ways for its review team - which employs thousands of people - to react to such content more quickly. In addition, the firm has developed software to prevent such footage being reshared in full on its service at a later point. And it is also exploring the use of artificial intelligence to automatically flag videos and photos that need to be reviewed rather than waiting for other users to report them. What it hasn't discussed is the idea of scrapping Facebook Live altogether. With Twitter and YouTube, among others, offering rival live-streaming products, doing so could put it at a disadvantage. But as a result, there will inevitably be further outrages and criticism because Facebook Live's popularity makes it all but impossible for the firm to keep a human eye over each broadcast.
By Mike HillsVisual journalist Fast forward four months and the virus has spread across all 50 states, leaving a death toll of 100,000 from more than 1.6 million confirmed cases. We've taken a look at how those figures compare to other countries around the world and how the situation could develop over the next few months. How does the situation in the US compare? The death toll in the US became the highest in the world in early April and has risen dramatically since then. President Donald Trump initially said "50 to 60,000" people could die during the outbreak but in May he said he was hopeful the toll would be lower than 100,000. That benchmark has now been hit though and there are still about 1,000 deaths a day on average. Rather than focus on deaths, Mr Trump has preferred to cite the mortality rate - that is the number of people that have died relative to the country's population - as evidence that the US has dealt with the virus more effectively than some other nations. The chart below shows the countries with the highest death tolls and, to the right, their mortality rate. You can see that by that measure there are several countries where a greater proportion of the population has died during the coronavirus outbreak. Belgium, with a population of 11.5 million, has seen 82 people in every 100,000 die during its coronavirus outbreak while the US, with a population of around 330 million, has seen nearly 30 people in every 100,000 die. But if you look at New York - the worst-hit state in the US - the mortality rate there is close to 150 people in every 100,000, which shows that there is a lot of variation across the US. One of the problems with comparing countries is that many of them report deaths in different ways. Belgium, for instance, includes deaths where coronavirus was suspected of being present but was never confirmed with a test. Some US states record deaths this way, but not all. There have also been questions over whether official data from some countries can be trusted. Critics of China in particular have accused it of under-reporting the scale of its outbreak. Another issue is that countries could be at different stages of an outbreak. In many European countries it's clear that daily cases numbers are coming down significantly and they are past the peak. But you can't say the same for the US at the moment. New York over the worst, but is the US? Several countries in Europe had outbreaks around the same time as the US and all of them have seen the number of deaths grow quickly, peak and then fall away. The US has not. One of the reasons the number of daily deaths in the US has plateaued rather than fallen is the sheer size of the country - rather than one large outbreak, there have been multiple centres of infection that developed at different times and spread at different rates. In New York, the virus struck early, spread quickly and peaked in early April. In the rest of the US, however, the number of daily deaths has been slow to fall. Some other states that were badly affected early on, like Louisiana and Michigan, have also seen a substantial drop in the number of daily deaths like that in New York. But as the situation in those states has improved, others have worsened. About a third of all states saw more deaths last week compared to the week before, with Rhode Island, Mississippi and Ohio seeing some of the largest percentage increases. US leads the way in testing, but only now In recent weeks, President Trump has been keen to talk about the number of tests being done in the US. The most recent data says the US has carried out about 15 million so far. That figure puts the US way ahead of other countries, but when it comes to using testing to try to control the virus, there is more to it than the total number you've conducted. Countries that did a lot of testing early in the pandemic, and followed it up by tracing the contacts of anyone who was infected, have been most successful in slowing the spread. In South Korea, for example, they ramped up testing early on in the outbreak and managed to contain the virus. Less than 300 people have died with coronavirus in the country, which has a population of about 50 million. But as the chart above shows, it wasn't until several weeks after the first death in the US that officials really stepped up testing. The top US health official for infectious diseases, Anthony Fauci, admitted in early March that the testing system was "currently failing" and that the US was not able to supply tests "easily, the way people in other countries are doing it". The number of daily tests shows the US is well past those initial problems, but progress can still be made. If the 15m figure is accurate, that would still only be 4.5% of the population. So what happens next in the US? The death toll is still rising, albeit at a slower rate, and one model that has been cited by the White House predicts it could be at nearly 150,000 by August - although its projections have come in low in the past. One of the issues with making projections is that no one is quite sure what effect the gradual reopening of the US economy will have on the spread of the virus. At one point, more than 90% of the US population was under mandatory lockdown orders, but the majority of states have now begun to loosen their stay-at-home restrictions. The White House has outlined a set of criteria for states to meet before they begin reopening, including seeing a downward trajectory of case numbers for two weeks. But a group of public health experts say only a couple of states are hitting the targets. Dr Fauci has warned states that they will see "little spikes that might turn into outbreaks" if they reopen before getting the virus under control. But his advice has contradicted that of President Trump, who is keen to get the US economy restarted ahead of his re-election campaign. The latest figures show that nearly a quarter of the American workforce have lost their jobs since the outbreak began. Asked earlier this month whether lives would be lost to reopen the country, Mr Trump said: "Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country opened and we have to get it open soon." Even if states continue to ease restrictions, it's unclear whether the American public will be eager to return to shops and restaurants just yet. A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that 70% of Americans were concerned that states would reopen too quickly.
The alleged scheme involved helping students cheat on entrance exams, as well as getting non-athletic students admitted on fake athletic scholarships. Elite schools Yale, Stanford and Georgetown were among the destination universities. There was no suggestion that the schools were involved in wrongdoing. Who was a part of the alleged scam? The defendants are largely wealthy and also include CEOs of major companies. "These parents are a catalogue of wealth and privilege," said US Attorney Andrew Lelling at a news conference about the investigation known as Operation Varsity Blues on Tuesday. According to the charging documents, Ms Huffman made a "charitable contribution" of $15,000 (£11,500) to participate in the scheme on behalf of her eldest daughter. She allegedly arranged to use the scheme a second time, for her younger daughter, before deciding not to do so. Ms Huffman was charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. She was secretly recorded discussing the scheme with a co-operating witness. The papers said the co-operating witness met Ms Huffman and her husband, the actor William H Macy, at their Los Angeles home and explained the scam to them. The witness said the pair "agreed to the plan". Mr Macy was not indicted. Ms Huffman appeared in a Los Angeles court later on Tuesday and was released on $250,000 bail. The judge ordered the actress to restrict her travel to the continental US. Mr Macy also attended court. The actress Lori Loughlin, best known for starring in the US sitcom Full House, was also among those indicted. Ms Loughlin and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli - who was also indicted - "agreed to pay bribes totalling $500,000 in exchange for having their two daughters designated as recruits" to the University of Southern California (USC) rowing team, the documents said. Both their daughters are currently studying at USC. Federal prosecutors in Boston charged William "Rick" Singer, 58, with running the alleged scheme through his company Edge College & Career Network. Mr Singer pleaded guilty on Tuesday in Boston federal court to charges including racketeering, money laundering, and obstruction of justice. He could receive a maximum of 65 years in prison and more than $1m in fines. He told the court: "I am responsible. I put all the people in place," local news site Mass Live reported. Mr Singer will be sentenced in June. According to the FBI, athletics coaches at various institutions were also involved in the scheme - recommending the fraudulent applicants internally and pocketing bribes in return. The head women's football coach at Yale University was allegedly paid $400,000 to accept a student who did not even play the sport - and those parents gave Mr Singer $1.2m for arranging the bribe. "This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions through the steady application of wealth, combined with fraud," Mr Lelling said. "There can be no separate college admission for wealthy, and I will add there will not be a separate criminal justice system either." In all, 33 parents were charged as well as 13 athletics coaches and associates of Mr Singer's business. How did the alleged scheme work? The documents detailed two alleged scams run by Mr Singer's firm, Edge College & Career Network: cheating on college entrance exams and using connections with coaches at top schools to organise bribes while faking athletic credentials for students. "Some parents took advantage of one... some took advantage of the other, and some took advantage of both," Mr Lelling said. Parents including Ms Huffman and Ms Loughlin paid somewhere between several thousand dollars and $6.5m to Edge for its services, authorities said, earning Singer about $25m between roughly 2011 and 2018. The firm reportedly instructed parents to claim their child had a disability which required that they be given extra time to complete exams. The FBI said parents were then told to invent an excuse - such as a family wedding - for their students to sit the entrance exams at specific facilities, where staff had been bribed to turn a blind eye to cheating. Someone working for the firm involved in the scandal either sat the exam for the students, gave students the answers, or corrected their answer papers, the FBI said. The Edge staff member who assisted in the cheating was briefed on exactly how well to perform, in order not to raise suspicion that a child's scores had improved too much, the FBI said. In most cases, the students did not know their admissions had been paid for with bribes, but in several the students were involved, officials added. The firm also allegedly created detailed fake athletics profiles for students - including photo-shopping the faces of potential students on to pictures of athletes found online - allowing students to be recruited on athletic scholarships. Mr Lelling said the case arose after authorities were tipped off by the "target of an entirely different investigation". What's the reaction? USC said it had fired two employees who were indicted in the alleged bribery case: senior associate athletic director Donna Heinel and water polo coach Jovan Vavic. Court documents say Mr Vavic placed two students on his water polo team to help them get into the university, and was paid $250,000. Ms Heinel also allegedly accepted bribes to facilitate admissions. "USC is in the process of identifying any funds received by the university in connection with this alleged scheme. Additionally, the university is reviewing its admissions processes broadly to ensure that such actions do not occur going forward." Georgetown, Yale, UCLA, Wake Forest and the University of Texas released similar statements acknowledging the investigation. On social media, many have expressed outrage over the alleged scam, pointing out that the US college system is already biased in favour of wealthier, white Americans. And others have noted that for the mega-rich, it's easy to legally donate money to a school in order to receive admission. Exam cheating around the world
The star, who launched his career with Wham! in the 1980s and had huge success as a solo performer, "passed away peacefully" on Christmas Day in Goring, Oxfordshire, his publicist said. His manager, Michael Lippman, said he had died of heart failure. Former Wham! bandmate Andrew Ridgeley said he was "heartbroken at the loss of my beloved friend". Writing on Twitter and referring to Michael by his family nickname of "Yog", he added: "Me, his loved ones, his friends, the world of music, the world at large. 4ever loved. A xx" On Instagram, Sir Elton John posted a photograph of himself with Michael, writing: "I am in deep shock. I have lost a beloved friend - the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist. My heart goes out to his family and all of his fans." Obituary: George Michael George Michael: A life in pictures How the world reacted George Michael: Six songs that defined his life Michael's family announced news of his death in a statement issued through the singer's publicist. "It is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period," it said. "The family would ask that their privacy be respected at this difficult and emotional time. There will be no further comment at this stage." South Central Ambulance Service were called to Michael's property at 13:42 GMT. Thames Valley Police also attended and Michael was confirmed dead at the scene. They added: "At this stage the death is being treated as unexplained but not suspicious. A post-mortem will be undertaken in due course. " Home village mourns George Michael A small heart wreath and a rose are among the tributes left outside the front door of Michael's home, a detached property by the River Thames. Court battle Michael, who was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou in north London, sold more than 100 million albums throughout a career spanning almost four decades. He first found fame with schoolfriend Ridgeley in duo Wham! - reaching number one in the UK singles charts on four occasions. One of the band's most enduring songs Last Christmas, is currently number 16 in the UK singles chart. The song was originally released in 1984 and is the biggest selling single not to reach number one. It was kept off the chart's top spot by Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas, which actually featured Michael. Solo albums followed, including the multi-million selling Faith in 1987. The follow-up Listen Without Prejudice Vol. 1 outsold Faith in the UK but led to Michael losing a court case with record label Sony over his frustration at how the album has been marketed. From teen idol to long-term stardom His talents as a singer, songwriter and music producer made George Michael one of the world's biggest-selling artists. Blessed with good looks and a fine singing voice, his stage presence made him a favourite on the live concert circuit as he matured from teen idol to long term stardom. But there were times when his battle with drugs and encounters with the police made lurid headlines that threatened to eclipse his musical talents. Read more in George Michael's obituary As a solo artist, Michael scored a further seven number one singles in the UK with songs including Careless Whisper and Fastlove, collaborated with the likes of Aretha Franklin and Elton John, and won three Brit Awards and two Grammys. The Grammy organisers said Michael's "extraordinary talent had a profound impact on countless entertainers worldwide, and his creative contributions will live on forever". Troubled artist Michael later began facing headlines for reasons other than his music. After years of refusing to be drawn on speculation about his sexuality, Michael disclosed he was gay in 1998 after being arrested in a public toilet in Beverly Hills, California, for engaging in a lewd act. The music video for the single that followed, Outside, featured a men's bathroom transformed into a disco and policemen kissing. In October 2006 he pleaded guilty to driving while unfit through drugs, and in 2008 was cautioned for possession of class A drugs, including crack cocaine. In September 2010, Michael received an eight-week prison sentence following an incident in which he crashed his Range Rover into a shop in north London. He admitted driving under the influence of drugs and possessing cannabis. Pop stars from Michael's heyday were joined by contemporary names in paying tribute on Twitter. ABC's Martin Fry said: "Absolutely devastated to hear of the loss of @GeorgeMichael Truly brilliant talent #sad #sad #sad." Duran Duran referred to the the so-called curse of 2016 - following the deaths of David Bowie, Prince and Rick Parfitt - posting on their official Twitter account: "2016 - loss of another talented soul. All our love and sympathy to @GeorgeMichael's family." The band included a picture of Michael with its frontman Simon Le Bon, Sting and Bob Geldof. Madonna posted a video from 1989 on Twitter and Instagram of herself presenting Michael with an award, and wrote: "Another Great Artist leaves us". Robbie Williams, whose first solo single was a cover of Michael's song Freedom, wrote: "Oh God no …I love you George …Rest In Peace x". DJ Tony Blackburn said: "Unbelievable, George Michael has died at the age of 53. RIP. This dreadful year goes on and on. So sad, a real talent." Speaking to the BBC, Paul Young recalled an impromptu duet with Michael at a Prince's Trust event in 1986. He said his voice "cuts straight through your heart". Boy George wrote: "He was so loved and I hope he knew it because the sadness today is beyond words. Devastating. "What a beautiful voice he had and his music will live on as a testament to his talent. I can't believe he is gone. I hope the Buddha will hold him in his arms." See more reaction to Michael's death How I featured on a George Michael song George Michael's UK number one singles In 2011, Michael postponed a series of concerts after being taken to hospital for treatment for pneumonia. After treatment in a Vienna hospital, he made a tearful appearance outside his London home and said it had been "touch and go" whether he lived. The experience inspired the single White Light which was his last Top 40 hit in 2012 and which he performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London. Earlier this month it was announced that producer and songwriter Naughty Boy was working with Michael on a new album. Michael had also recently been working on a documentary chronicling his rise to fame with Wham! and made a direct appeal on Twitter to his fans, asking them to send in their own videos and photographs dating from 1988 to 1996. The documentary film entitled Freedom was originally expected to be released this year but was recently delayed until next March. How George Michael inspired Carpool Karaoke phenomenon In 2011, George Michael joined James Corden for a Comic Relief sketch on BBC One which went on to inspire the hugely successful Carpool Karaoke segments on Corden's Late Late Show on CBS. The feature is now a staple of the American chat show, with stars such as Madonna and Michelle Obama having appeared, and attracts huge online audiences. The original sketch began with Corden poking fun at Michael and ended with the pair singing along to Wham!'s I'm Your Man. Corden said: "I've loved George Michael for as long as I can remember. He was an absolute inspiration. Always ahead of his time."
By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent, BBC News, Berlin There must be a "massive shift" to renewable energy, says the study released in Berlin. It has been finalised after a week of negotiations between scientists and government officials. Natural gas is seen as a key bridge to move energy production away from oil and coal. But there have been battles between participants over who will pay for this energy transition. The report is the work of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which was set up to provide a clear scientific view on climate change and its impacts. The Summary for Policymakers on mitigation paints a picture of a world with carbon emissions rising rapidly. "The high speed mitigation train needs to leave the station very soon, and all of global society will have to get on board," the IPCC's chair Rajendra Pachauri told journalists in Berlin at the launch of the report. Dr Youba Sokono, a co-chair of the IPCC's working group 3, which drew up the report, said science has spoken. He added that policy makers were "the navigators, they have to make decisions, scientists are the map makers". The UK's Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey said global warming needed to be tackled using "all technologies". He told BBC News: "We can do this, we have to because it's so challenging and threatening to our economies and societies, our health, our food security. The report today shows we can do it if we have the political will." He added that the UK government was a leader on the use of renewable energy sources, saying: "We've, for example, doubled the amount of renewable electricity in the last few years. We're likely to do better than our targets in increasing renewable electricity. But we've got to do more." About half of all the carbon that humans have pumped into the atmosphere since 1750 has been emitted in the last 40 years. Rates have been rising fast since 2000, despite the global economic crash. The report points to an increased use of coal in the decade from the turn of the millennium , "reversing the longstanding trend of decarbonisation of the world's energy supply". Driven by a global increase in population and economic activity, global surface temperature increases will be between 3.7C and 4.8C in 2100 if no new action is taken. This is way above the 2 degree level, regarded as the point beyond which dangerous impacts of climate change will be felt. However, the scientists involved in the report say this situation can be turned around. "It needs a big change in the energy sector, that is undoubtedly true," said Prof Jim Skea, vice-chair of working group 3. "One of the biggest areas that's important is getting the carbon out of electricity, so renewable energy, nuclear, fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage, that's all part of the menu if we are going to make the transition to stay under the 2 degree target." It is not a simple task. To be sure of staying below 2 degrees, the amount of carbon in the air needs to be around 450 parts per million by 2100. To get there, emissions in 2050 need to be 40-70% lower than they were in 2010. The IPCC says that renewables are a critical part of that pathway. Since the last report in 2007, the scientists say that renewable energy has come on in leaps and bounds. In 2012, renewables accounted for just over half of the new electricity generation added around the world. The scientists stress that renewables are becoming economically competitive with fossil fuels and also offer a range of other benefits, including clean air and energy security. "It certainly is the end for carbon intensive fuels that's for sure," said Jennifer Morgan from the World Resources Institute, who was a review editor on one of the chapters of the IPCC report. "There needs to be a massive shift away from fossil fuels and investment needs to shift to going 100% clean as fast as possible." Prof Ottmar Edenhofer, co-chair of working group 3, said: "Mitigation does not mean the world has to sacrifice economic growth." He explained that the report added "modest hope", but added: "Climate policy is not a free lunch." One of the surprising endorsements in the report is natural gas. "Emissions from energy supply can be reduced significantly by replacing current world average coal-fired power plants with modern, highly efficient natural gas combined-cycle power plants," says the summary. The report describes natural gas as a "bridge" technology with deployment increasing before peaking and falling below current levels by 2050. However many of the scenarios examined by the panel would still involve an "overshoot" of the target range. To cope with this the world may need to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Combining carbon capture and storage with bioenergy is seen as one potential solution, but the report is lukewarm on these ideas, saying the "methods are uncertain" and are "associated with risks". Timing is everything, say the scientists. "Delaying mitigation efforts beyond those in place today through 2030 is estimated to substantially increase the difficulty of the transition to low longer-term emissions," says the summary. "If we delay we are faced with hard choices," said Prof Skea. "Do we give up on the 2 degrees target or do we employ these techniques that suck CO2 out of the atmosphere - if we proceed promptly and we get a deal in Paris next year, then we need to rely less on these ideas." The report points out that there needs to be huge shifts in investment if the worst impacts of rising temperatures are to be avoided. Investment in renewables and other low carbon sources needs to at least treble by the middle of the century, while money flowing into fossil fuels has to diminish. But differences have emerged over who should make the cuts in emissions and who should pay for the switch to low carbon energy sources. Developed and developing countries have clashed here in Berlin, echoing divisions found in the UN negotiations. "It is true that some of the dynamics that we see in the UNFCCC negotiations were visible here as well," said Kaisa Kosenen from Greenpeace. "It is an indication that the key question of equity - who should do what and who should pay for the damages already caused." Other participants believed that this new report could actually help push the UN process forward. "I hope that this information from the IPCC can kind of do a bit of a tectonic shift into a co-operating mode rather than a finger pointing mode between countries," said Jennifer Morgan. "There's too much at stake." Follow Matt on Twitter.
The slight increase moves the rate, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), above its recent five-year low. The Office for National Statistics (ONS), said the marginal rise was because transport costs fell by less than they did a year ago. In addition, prices in the recreation and culture sectors rose, particularly for computer games and toys. However, the price of food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 1.4% in October, when compared with last year, marking the sixth consecutive month without a rise - the longest such period since 2000. Furniture and household equipment prices also fell, by 1.1%, most notably three-piece suites and settees. In a separate development on Tuesday, retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel said UK grocery sales had fallen for the first time in twenty years. It said price competition had pushed down grocery prices by 0.4%. The ONS also reported that the Retail Prices Index grew by 2.3% in the year to the end of October, the same rate as recorded for September. Seasonal factors Last week, the Bank of England warned the inflation rate could dip to as low as 1% in the coming six months. However, the small rise in the rate of inflation is unlikely to alter the central bank's decision to keep its key interest rate at 0.5% for the time being. The Bank targets an inflation rate of 2%. The BBC's economics editor, Robert Peston, said the small rise seemed largely due to seasonal factors, such as the timing of student fee increases and sales of Christmas games, and that the overall trend for the CPI was probably still downwards. Reacting to the ONS report, David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce said that despite the small increase, "the impact of low oil prices will have a noticeable impact in coming months, causing inflation to drop". "We expect inflation to fluctuate around 1% until late 2015, before rising towards 2.0% in 2016," he added.
Speaking in New York, Mr Guterres said if any country doubted the need for the 2015 Paris climate accord, then other countries must "stay the course". He was speaking after US President Donald Trump refused to join other leaders of the G7 group of rich nations in reaffirming support for the accord. He is due to decide the US stance soon. President Trump has previously dismissed global warming as a "hoax" created by China and has threatened to pull out of the Paris accord. Mr Guterres was making his first major statement on climate since taking office as UN chief five months ago. "If any government doubts the global will and need for this accord, that is reason for all others to unite even stronger and stay the course," he told the audience at New York University. "The message is simple: the sustainability train has left the station. Get on board or get left behind." He added: "The world is in a mess. It is absolutely essential that the world implements the Paris agreement." Responding to questions, he said: "We believe that it would be important for the US not to leave the Paris agreement. "But even if the government decides to leave the Paris agreement, it's very important for US society as a whole - the cities, the states, the companies, the businesses - to remain engaged." New York and California have already pledged to combat climate change without the Trump administration's support. The UN chief said he intended to convene a summit in 2019 to review progress on implementing the Paris accord. "Climate change is undeniable. Climate action is unstoppable," he said. The US is one of more than 140 countries and organisations that have ratified the agreement, but Mr Trump railed against it on the campaign trail saying it was bad for the US economy. He has repeatedly promised to strengthen the coal industry. The Paris deal is the world's first comprehensive climate agreement, with the aim of keeping the global average rise in temperatures below 2C. In order to do that, countries pledge to reduce their carbon emissions. Last weekend President Trump left the G7 summit in Sicily without reaffirming his commitment to the accord, unlike the other six world leaders in attendance.
By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent For the US, this highly secret operation, conducted without informing the Pakistan government, was both payback and a form of closure for the 9/11 attacks of 2001. For Pakistan, it was both a national insult and an embarrassment. Bin Laden, or "OBL" as he became known in the West, had been discovered living comfortably just 31 miles (50km) from the capital, Islamabad, and almost under the nose of Pakistan's Military Academy in Abbottabad. But five years on from that dawn raid, later dramatised by Hollywood in the film Zero Dark Thirty, violent jihadism is still very much a global phenomenon. The last 12 months have seen jihadist attacks on almost every continent - in Europe, America, the Middle East, South East Asia and Africa. So how much of this is Osama Bin Laden's legacy and what will be his lasting impact, if any, on the world? How the lives of Osama Bin Laden's neighbours changed forever Bin Laden: The long hunt for the al-Qaeda leader Was killing legal? Was Bin Laden still in charge of al-Qaeda? In pictures: Osama Bin Laden's life Bin Laden files: Seven things we learned "Bin Laden's death did leave a legacy," says Dr Sajjan Gohel, of the Asia Pacific Foundation, "but to some extent, it has been usurped by Isis (so-called Islamic State, also known as IS) who have taken over and built on his goals for creating a transnational terrorist project". To many people, the 22-year-long era of Bin Laden's al-Qaeda from 1989 to 2011 might not seem that different from the violent ideology of today's IS. Both groups have espoused a narrow-minded, intolerant version of the Islamic religion, casting anyone - even other Sunni Muslims - as apostates if they do not share their world view. They both use suicide bombings and mass murder of civilians as tactics and they both reject the concept of democracy as being incompatible with Sharia, Islamic law. Longer-term strategy Yet they are different and if OBL - or Abu Abdullah as he was known to his followers - were alive today he would almost certainly have disapproved of the actions and timing of IS. Bin Laden's strategy was a patient, long-term, generational one. He was hoping that 9/11 and other spectacular attacks would so demoralise the US and the West that they would abandon their support for secular Arab regimes in the Middle East, paving the way for an eventual takeover by jihadists and the creation of an Islamic caliphate. He saw this as being perhaps decades away and probably not in his natural lifetime. Even before his death, there were indications that OBL and the al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan disagreed with the extreme violence being employed by al-Qaeda's Iraqi franchise which went on to become the modern-day IS. Osama Bin Laden: Obituary: Osama Bin Laden "IS has gone in different directions from Bin Laden's al-Qaeda," says Dr Gohel. "It deliberately kills Sunni Muslims, including women and children. (IS has carried out several mosque bombings in Saudi Arabia, killing Sunni and Shia alike). "It also engages in criminal activity, human trafficking and is open to recruiting women, all of which al-Qaeda was opposed to." Years from now, historians will most likely conclude that the death of Osama Bin Laden in that pre-dawn US raid on 2 May 2011 dealt a near-fatal blow to the organisation he came to represent. His successor, Dr Ayman Al-Zawahiri, is a dull, bespectacled Egyptian ideologue devoid of charisma. His long, wordy speeches are in marked contrast to the snappy use of social media and the internet by today's generation of IS operatives. The controversial CIA-run programme of drone strikes in Pakistan's Tribal Territories has kept what is left of Bin Laden's organisation constantly looking over its shoulders, inhibiting its ability to plan a repeat of the London bombings. Al-Qaeda's regional franchises, like Al-Shabaab in Somalia and AQAP in Yemen, have largely been left to develop by themselves. Watershed moment Richard Clarke, who was President George W Bush's counter-terrorism chief until 2003, believes that regardless of what followed, the death of Bin Laden marked a watershed. "I think there was a propaganda effect right away," he says. "As long as he was alive, the Americans looked impotent but the longer term effect (of his death) was that al-Qaeda Central, their headquarters, never really recovered. Al-Qaeda as a multinational organisation doesn't really exist." Yet without such a single, identifiable target as OBL, today's IS presents a more diffuse and difficult target for the US to hit. Its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, rarely surfaces and IS will have anyway planned long ago for his demise. In recent days, the US presidential hopeful Donald Trump has vowed to destroy IS, without saying how. But as the global effort grinds on to defeat or at least contain violent Islamic extremism, the absence of such a charismatic figure as OBL was to his followers makes it unlikely that such a decisive one-off moment as his death five years ago will ever be repeated.
The 18-month review, details of which were leaked to the Reuters news agency, suggests security vulnerabilities posed a greater threat than any links between the firm and the Chinese government. Last week a US congressional report warned against allowing Chinese companies Huawei and ZTE Corp to supply critical telecom infrastructure. The firms have always denied espionage. The classified inquiry was a thorough review of how Huawei worked, involving nearly 1,000 telecom equipment buyers. One of the government employees involved with the inquiry told Reuters: "We knew certain parts of government really wanted evidence of active spying. We would have found it if it were there." Huawei spokesman Bill Plummer said: "Huawei is not familiar with the review, but we are not surprised to hear that the White House has concluded there is no evidence of any Huawei involvement with any espionage or other non-commercial activities. "Huawei is a $32bn [£19bn] independent multinational that would not jeopardise its success or the integrity of its customers' networks for any government or third party - ever," he added. ZTE's senior vice president of Europe and North America, Zhu Jiny, told the BBC: "The security issues should not be focused on the Chinese companies. These are problems of the world situation. It's not only Chinese companies - it's a global issue." Sloppy code Last week at a conference in Malaysia, Felix Lindner, an expert in network equipment security, said he had discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Huawei's routers. "I'd say it was five times easier to find one in a Huawei router than in a Cisco one," he said. He blamed sloppy coding rather than any deliberate attempt to leave backdoors open for spying purposes. Questions about the relationship between Huawei, ZTC and the Chinese government circulated last week following a report from the US House Intelligence Committee. While the report did not present concrete evidence that either Huawei or ZTE had stolen US data, it said had classified information that provided "significantly more information adding to the committee's concerns" about the risk to the United States. It also criticised Huawei for failing to provide details about its relationship with the Chinese government. Attitudes about Huawei differ from nation to nation. Canada said last week that the firm could not bid to help build a secure national network. In Britain, however, a spokesman for the Cabinet Office said Huawei's products were fully vetted and did not represent a security concern.
In the open letter, the group said the government crackdown on the population amounted to "ethnic cleansing". More than 34,000 Rohingya have been forced to flee military operations in Rakhine state, according to the UN. Ms Suu Kyi, Myanmar's de facto leader, is accused of failing to protect the minority group. "A human tragedy amounting to ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity is unfolding in Myanmar," the group, which includes South Africa's Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai, wrote in a letter to the UN Security Council. "If we fail to take action, people may starve to death if they are not killed with bullets," it added. The group, consisting of Nobel laureates, politicians, philanthropists and activists, said it was "frustrated" that Ms Suu Kyi, herself a Nobel laureate, "has not taken any initiative to ensure full and equal citizenship rights of the Rohingyas". At least 86 people have been killed in operations in Rakhine state, launched after armed militants attacked border posts in Maungdaw on 9 October, killing nine policemen. Earlier this month the government of Myanmar was criticised by the UN over its treatment of the minority Rohingya Muslim population. Myanmar's government said it was conducting counter-terrorism operations in the region and has denied reports of killings and other abuses. Most of the displaced Rohingya have fled across the border into Bangladesh. On Friday, director general of Myanmar's ministry of foreign affairs, Kyaw Zaya, told Reuters news agency that Myanmar recognised that 2,415 of its citizens were in Bangladesh, adding that they were welcome to return. Who are the Rohingya? The estimated one million Muslim Rohingya are seen by many in mainly Buddhist Myanmar as illegal migrants from Bangladesh. They are denied citizenship by the government despite many having lived there for generations. Communal violence in Rakhine state in 2012 left scores dead and displaced more than 100,000 people, with many Rohingya still remaining in decrepit camps. They face widespread discrimination and mistreatment. Hundreds of thousands of undocumented Rohingya are estimated to live in Bangladesh, having fled Myanmar.
The aid agency has had no contact with the gunmen, an ICRC spokesman says. Earlier, Syrian state media said gunmen had opened fire on Red Cross staff travelling on the road between Sarmin and Saraqeb in Idlib province. The ICRC says it has been struggling to gain access across Syria to provide aid to injured and displaced people. Appeal A convoy carrying six ICRC staff members and one Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteer was intercepted by unidentified armed gunmen near the town of Saraqeb in Idlib province, ICRC spokeswoman Rima Kamal told the BBC. "We call for the immediate release of the seven colleagues abducted this morning... who work tirelessly to provide assistance to those most in need in Syria. Incidents such as this one unfortunately will undermine our capacity to assist those who need our help," she said. The ICRC has declined to reveal the identity, gender or nationality of the abducted workers but they are believed to include both local and international staff, who are mainly medical specialists. Syrian state news agency Sana earlier quoted an unnamed official as saying the workers were abducted and taken to an unknown location after gunmen blocked their path and shot at their convoy. The aid agency did not confirm whether shots had been fired, but said the team's vehicles were also missing. An ICRC statement said the vehicles they were travelling in had been clearly marked with the Red Cross emblem, "which is not a religious symbol". Another ICRC spokesman, Simon Schorno, told Associated Press the attack took place at around 11:30 (08:30 GMT) on Sunday as the team was returning to Damascus. He said the team had been in the field since 10 October to assess the medical situation and deliver aid in what he described as "a difficult area to go in". It is not yet clear who carried out the kidnapping, but Syrian state TV blamed it on what it called "armed terrorists" - a term it frequently uses to describe anti-government rebels. Hardline Islamist rebels are known to operate in the area, says the BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut. Kidnappings, particularly of aid workers and journalists, have become increasingly common in the north, where much of the countryside has fallen into rebel hands. In August, the ICRC said the number of Syrian Arab Red Crescent volunteers who had lost their lives since the start of the conflict had risen to 22. The abductions will clearly complicate further the already difficult and dangerous task of providing humanitarian aid to all parts of the country, he adds, at a time when the UN is pressing all sides to allow freer access. On Saturday, the Syrian government began the evacuation of around 1,500 civilians, mainly women and children, from a rebel-held Damascus suburb besieged by the army for months. Many of those coming out of Muadhamiya, south-west of Damascus, were said to be exhausted and traumatised. In a separate development, the state news agency said two car bombs exploded on Sunday evening near the state TV building in Damascus. The TV headquarters in the capital's Umayyad Square was reportedly damaged in the attack, but there was no immediate word on casualties, the agency reported. More than 100,000 people have been killed since the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad began in March 2011, according to the UN. Earlier this month, the UN estimated that more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes by the country's civil war by the end of 2014.
Making the announcement, Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, called her a "master of the contemporary short story". The 82-year-old, whose books include Dear Life and Dance of the Happy Shades, is only the 13th woman to win the prize since its inception in 1901. "I knew I was in the running, yes, but I never thought I would win," Munro told Canadian media. Presented by the Nobel Foundation, the award - which is presented to a living writer - is worth eight million kronor (£770,000). Previous winners include literary giants such as Rudyard Kipling, Toni Morrison and Ernest Hemingway. Mr Englund told The Associated Press that he had not been able to contact Munro ahead of the announcement so left a message on her answering machine, informing her of her win. "She has taken an art form, the short story, which has tended to come a little bit in the shadow behind the novel, and she has cultivated it almost to perfection,'' he added. Munro, who began writing in her teenage years, published her first story, The Dimensions of a Shadow, in 1950. She had been studying English at the University of Western Ontario at the time. Chekov Dance of the Happy Shades, published in 1968, was Munro's first collection, and it went on to win Canada's highest literary prize, the Governor General's Award. In 2009, she won the Man Booker International Prize for her entire body of work - but she downplayed her achievements. "I think maybe I was successful in doing this because I didn't have any other talents," she once said in an interview with Book Lounge. BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz said Munro had been "at the very top of her game since she started". "Very few writers are her equal," he said, adding "she gets to the heart of what it is to be human". "I thought she might not win because she's not overtly political; and of late the Nobel has tended to go to political writers." The award "probably won't make a commercial difference" to the author, he added, but it "makes a huge difference to how her work will be viewed in historical terms". "If she hadn't won it before she died, I think it would have been a terrible, terrible omission." Often compared to Anton Chekhov, she is known for writing about the human spirit and a regular theme of her work is the dilemma faced by young girls growing up and coming to terms with living in a small town. The Nobel academy praised her "finely tuned storytelling, which is characterised by clarity and psychological realism". 'Pipe dreams' Munro, whose daughter woke her to tell her she had won the Nobel, said she was "terribly surprised" and "delighted". Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), she said she always viewed her chances of winning as "one of those pipe dreams" that "might happen, but it probably wouldn't". "It's the middle of the night here and I had forgotten about it all, of course," she added. Since the 1960s, Munro has published more than a dozen collections of short stories, many of which take place in her native southwest Ontario. Her writing has brought her several awards. She won The Commonwealth Writers' Prize, the National Book Critics Circle prize for Hateship, Friendship, Courtship, Loveship, Marriage, and is a three-time winner of the Governor General's prize. Other notable books include Lives of Girls and Women, Who Do You Think You Are, The Progress of Love and Runaway. In 1980, The Beggar Maid was shortlisted for the annual Booker Prize for Fiction and her stories frequently appear in publications such as the New Yorker and the Paris Review. Retirement Several of her stories have also been adapted for the screen, including The Bear Came Over the Mountain, which became Away from Her, starring Julie Christie and Gordon Pinsent. Munro revealed earlier this year that her latest book, Dear Life, published in 2012, would be her last. "Perhaps, when you're my age, you don't wish to be alone as much as a writer has to be," she told Canada's National Post. In 2009, Munro revealed she had been receiving treatment for cancer. She also had bypass surgery for a heart condition. Notoriously publicity-shy, Munro shies away from public events. According to American literary critic David Homel: "She is not a socialite. She is actually rarely seen in public, and does not go on book tours. Munro will be presented with her latest award at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December, the anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, who established the prize. Last year's recipient was Chinese novelist Mo Yan.
The landmark legislation was approved after more than 100 hours of gruelling debate - including two all-night sittings. The law means terminally ill patients in Australia's second-most populous state will have the right to request a lethal drug from mid-2019. They must be aged at least 18 and have less than six months to live. "I'm proud today that we have put compassion right at the centre of our parliamentary and our political process," said state Premier Daniel Andrews. "That is politics at its best and it is Victoria doing what it does best - leading our nation." Protecting against coercion The law is designed for patients who are in severe pain. It has 68 safeguards, including: Additionally, patients must have lived in Victoria for at least 12 months and be of sound mind. Patients with some conditions - such as multiple sclerosis and ALS, also known as motor neurone disease (MND) - will become eligible when they have 12 months to live. The legislative debate included one sitting that lasted for 26 hours, and another that stretched for 28 hours. The bill was finally ratified with amendments on Wednesday. It was fiercely opposed by some lawmakers, who had attempted to add hundreds of amendments. Last month, Mr Andrews's own deputy, James Merlino, spoke strongly against what he called a "deeply flawed" bill that was "a recipe for elder abuse". In 1995, Australia's Northern Territory - which is not a state - introduced the world's first voluntary euthanasia law, but it was overturned by federal authorities in Canberra eight months later. The federal government does not have the same power over states. Laws allowing terminally ill patients to legally end their lives with a doctor's supervision have since been passed in countries including Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium.
France's culture minister Franck Riester said the "most precious treasures" have been saved, including what is said to be the crown of thorns worn by Jesus and the tunic of Saint Louis. The emergency services worked late into Monday night to salvage the art and other priceless pieces stored in the cathedral. The wooden interior has been destroyed. But which other features in the 850-year-old Gothic structure make it stand out in a city of iconic buildings? Rose windows - salvageable The cathedral has three rose windows dating back to the 13th Century, which are among its most famous features. The first, and smallest, on the west facade, was finished in around 1225 and celebrated for the way the glass seemingly upheld the stonework around it. The south rose has a diameter of nearly 13m (43ft) and is made up of 84 panels. However, it no longer retains its original stained glass because it was damaged in previous fires. André Finot, cathedral spokesman, told BFMTV that the rose windows appeared not to have been touched by the fire, although there were still fears for them because of the fragility of the building. And Alixe Bovey, a medieval art historian from the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, told BBC Radio Wales that "much more of [the glass] has survived than looked even remotely possible in the first few hours of the fire". She added that they "look more than salvageable" and "in really remarkable condition considering what they've been exposed to". Bells - fate unclear The cathedral has 10 bells - the largest, known as Emmanuel, weighs more than 23 tonnes and was installed in the south tower in 1685. The cathedral celebrated its 850th anniversary in 2013 by recasting the smaller bells from the north tower. Each was blessed with the name of a saint to replicate the original bells that were melted for cannon balls during the French Revolution. Writer Victor Hugo used the cathedral as a setting for his 1831 work The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. His main character, Quasimodo, is feared by locals for the way he looks - but finds sanctuary in the cathedral and is employed as a bell-ringer. Relics - safe Notre-Dame is home to relics from the Passion of Christ, described as a piece of the cross, a nail and the Holy Crown of Thorns, said to have been worn by Jesus before the crucifixion. Anne Hidalgo, mayor of Paris, tweeted that firefighters, police and others formed a human chain to rescue priceless artefacts, such as the crown and tunic said to have been worn by King Louis IX when he brought the crown of thorns to Paris. Paintings and textiles - some safe, some fate unclear BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said firefighters reported that some of the large paintings inside the cathedral were too heavy to take down from the walls and save. Some of the art and artefacts were stored overnight in City Hall but they would be moved to the Louvre museum as soon as possible, said French culture minister Franck Riester. Major paintings in the cathedral would be moved to the museum on Friday, after they had been protected, conserved and restored, he said. Mr Riester said they were mostly undamaged but may have suffered some effects from the smoke. Many of the cathedral's important artefacts - including paintings, sculptures and textiles - were held in its many chapels around the nave. These being relatively safe, Ms Bovey told the BBC, is thanks to the cathedral's stone vaults being "more or less sound" after the blaze - something that didn't look likely when it first started. "What can happen in fires like this is that they burn so hot that the stone vaults can fail, and then the fire can fall through into the body of the church and scorch the limestone," she said. But, she said, that doesn't appear to have happened. "I feel pretty optimistic looking at the external fabric that [the artefacts are] more than salvageable". Organ - safe The cathedral has three organs, including the 8,000-pipe Great Organ, first constructed in 1401 and rebuilt in the 18th and 19th Centuries. Despite many restorations and additions over the years, it still contains some pipes first installed in the medieval era. Deputy Mayor Emmanuel Gregoire told French news channel BFMTV that the organ remained intact. Organist Johann Vexo, who was playing a Mass when the fire alarm rang, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "It's the most famous instrument in the world. It was absolutely stunning, gorgeous - we don't have any words to describe it, it was a wonderful experience every time. It was such a privilege to work and to play in this wonderful place." Gargoyles and grotesques - fate unclear Anyone feeling fit enough to climb the stairs and gain views across Paris has to pass another of the cathedral's best-known features - the gargoyles and grotesques. These are two types of stone sculptures, often featuring mythical creatures. Unlike grotesques, gargoyles have water spouts to carry rainwater off the building, although several have already been replaced by PVC pipes because Notre-Dame's stonework has corroded. The most famous sculpture - known as the Stryge - sits on top of the building, watching out over the city with its head in its hands. Gothic spire - destroyed Notre-Dame's famous spire, which collapsed during Monday's fire, dates back to the 12th Century. It underwent several changes in the building's history - including being dismantled during the French Revolution, and later rebuilt in the 1860s. Reflecting on its collapse, the Royal Institute of British Architects said: "The loss of the roof and spire of Notre-Dame, and possibly the stone vault too, is an irreplaceable blow to the heritage of French Gothic architecture. "Our heart goes out to the people of France, and to lovers of our shared cultural heritage wherever they are." Two towers - safe Most visitors to Notre-Dame will spend some time standing before two Gothic towers which crown the western facade of the cathedral. Work on the western facade began in 1200, but the first tower - the north one - was not completed until 40 years later. Ten years after that, in 1250, the southern tower was completed. Both towers are 68m high, and climbing the 387 steps gives panoramic views of Paris. Officials said that both bell towers remain intact.
They have joined figures in health and education as signatories to a letter to the prime minister suggesting changes be made to the national curriculum. The letter says all pupils aged four to 14 would benefit from food education. The Department for Education said it was already undertaking a review. The letter says the "pride" of hosting the Olympic Games has been "tainted by the shameful fact that Britain is the fattest nation in Europe". Professor David Haslam, chair of the National Obesity Forum, who also signed the letter, said: "The 2012 Olympics provide a unique opportunity to improve the nation's health and reduce the burden of obesity. "However, sitting in front of the television, cheering our elite athletes on, while eating crisps and chocolates, drinking sugar-sweetened beverages is entirely counter-productive." Teaching children through the National Curriculum how to prepare nutritious meals for themselves and their families would be an important step in tackling the rising obesity epidemic, the letter argues. Without these skills, people are less likely to exercise meaningful control over their diet and food intake, and tend to rely on pre-prepared or takeaway foods, the campaigners add. Oliver has previously campaigned for healthier school dinners while Gerrard is ambassador for the Get Up, Get Moving programme designed to increase awareness of physical activity and healthy eating. Other signatories to the letter include Dr Clare Gerada, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, and Professor Terence Stephenson, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. Besides the call for compulsory cookery lessons, they note the need for more sporting role models to promote the benefits of a healthy lifestyle to children. They write: "As a group of charities and leading professionals in the field of medicine, food, sport, education and cookery, we firmly believe that the impact of obesity on our health is a very serious problem." 'Obesity crisis' Dr Gerada said: "I have a number of patients who have never cooked a meal, ever, in their entire lives. "The closest they may ever get to cooking a meal is putting something in the microwave. "I think it is important that we put cookery back into schools so that at least children can see how much sugar goes into an average cake or how much fat goes into a pastry so they can make choices about what they're going to eat." Prof Stephenson said: "The UK now has the highest rate of obesity in Europe, with one in three children overweight or obese by the age of nine.... "We need to act now but we will not win this fight alone. Parents, schools, healthcare professionals and the government must take a united approach in order to combat this obesity crisis." The Department for Education said it was reviewing the National Curriculum and would make a further announcement in the future. "We know that a healthy attitude towards food, developed early, is critical to the health, well-being and good educational attainment of young people," it said. "That's why we've asked the School Food Trust to use their expertise and draw up early years nutritional guidance and why maintained schools must abide by the national minimum standards for nutrition." It added that the Department of Health was committed to tackling obesity and major retailers and food manufacturers had backed the government's Responsibility Deal aimed at helping people to cut their calorie consumption.
An internal memo sent to staff earlier on Friday had said employees should delete the app over "security risks". The app, owned by a Chinese company, has come under scrutiny because of fears it could share data with China. TikTok said it did not understand Amazon's concerns. "This morning's email to some of our employees was sent in error. There is no change to our policies right now with regard to TikTok", a company spokesperson told the BBC. But earlier on Friday, a memo sent to staff seen by multiple news outlets stated that the app must be removed from mobile devices. "Due to security risk, the TikTok app is no longer permitted on mobile devices that access Amazon email. "If you have TikTok on your device, you must remove it by July 10 to retain mobile access to Amazon email", it read. TikTok said the company had not received any communication from Amazon before the email went out. Analysis by BBC Business reporter Mary-Ann Russon Artificial intelligence-powered short video app TikTok is one of the most downloaded mobile apps in the world, and its popularity has only grown during the coronavirus lockdown. This has drawn the attention of the Trump administration - on Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Fox News that it was considering a ban on Chinese social media apps. Mr Pompeo went so far as to say that TikTok users risk their private information ending up "in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party". TikTok is owned by Chinese start-up ByteDance, which has taken pains to point out that its chief executive is American. It has also said publicly several times that it has never, and will never, share TikTok users' data with the Chinese authorities. And on Friday, the firm decided to halt its operations in Hong Kong - a move designed to show its distance from the Chinese government. But many people use their smartphones for both recreation and to access their work email accounts. TikTok is on many personal smartphones, and with rising numbers of cyber-security vulnerabilities regularly being discovered in both the Android and iOS mobile operating systems, perhaps Amazon is now starting to worry whether the app could perhaps be used to infiltrate devices. "We still do not understand their concerns, we welcome a dialogue so we can address any issues they may have and enable their team to continue participating in our community," TikTok said. TikTok was launched outside mainland China by Beijing-based ByteDance to reach a global audience. It increased its popularity during the global coronavirus lockdowns with about 315 million people downloading the app in the first three months of this year, according to research firm Sensor Tower. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and an Australian member of parliament have recently suggested the app needs more scrutiny over its data and privacy policies because its headquarters are in China. Mr Pompeo has banned Department of State employees from downloading the app and suggested it could also be banned in the US.
Earlier this week it was announced a deal was almost secure to keep "Spy Booth" in the town, after campaigners raised the money to buy it. The piece, depicting men "snooping" on a phone box, appeared in April, three miles from government listening post GCHQ. The local businessman, who has agreed to pay for the artwork, said he was "confident" it could be saved. Jenny Lyon, whose boyfriend David Houghton spotted the vandalism on an early morning run, said: "There appears to be silver writing all over the three spies. It's completely ruined. It's awful. "People have worked so hard to keep it here and then somebody overnight has ruined it for everybody." 'Confident it will come off' Businessman Hekmat Kaveh, who agreed to pay an undisclosed amount to keep the artwork in place, said he believed it could be saved. "I believe the original paint had some anti-graffiti products in it and also an anti-graffiti product was put over the top of it. I am confident that it will come off," he said. Mr Kaveh said he was "rather surprised" local people had begun trying to remove the silver paint with a brush. "I would much rather get the professionals onto it," he said. Experts will be called in to complete the clean-up work on Saturday and Perspex will be put over it for protection. Gloucestershire Police said officers were carrying out inquiries and appealed for anyone who witnessed the act of vandalism to get in touch. Campaigners have been trying to keep the artwork in situ on the corner of Fairview Road and Hewlett Road after owners of the house claimed it had been sold and workmen arrived to remove it. Last month, Cheltenham Borough Council issued a temporary stop notice preventing further removal work from taking place on the Grade II* listed building.
Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent@BBCKarishmaon Twitter Dicky and his friends are students, but behind their camaraderie and carefree smiles lies an anxiety about their futures. They met me in the Mongkok district of Hong Kong and over a dinner of salty spinach and squid, I heard stories of frustration and futility. Dicky is studying to be a teacher and wants to be the main breadwinner for his family. But he doesn't think that's possible, because once he graduates from university he says he's unlikely to get a good job - or any job at all. "I want to change my family's life. In Hong Kong they have to work hard to pay the high rent," he told me, the emotion spilling out of his eyes. "Now when I grow up I cannot do that. The job vacancies are lower than before [and] when we graduate in three years the situation [will be] much lower." For 18-year-old Leung Suet Lam, the picture is much the same. "When I graduate, I think I'll live with my family," she tells me. "It is very difficult to get a flat here... buying is not realistic. "The structure of Hong Kong's houses are also very small - I will spend a lot of money to buy a small flat and that will limit the imagination of my life." Young people like Dicky and Leung are grappling with three big economic challenges: wages aren't rising, the job market is increasingly competitive, and property prices are surging. While the reasons for the political protests are complex, and aren't to do with buying a home or getting a job, many young people in Hong Kong feel ignored by decades of poorly-planned government policies. That's fuelled their resentment of a system they feel is working against them. Slow wage growth Competition for a place in one of Hong Kong's top universities is fierce, but even if you do get a spot and graduate, a good job or stable income isn't guaranteed. Increasingly, Hong Kongers are also competing for jobs with Chinese students. Chan Wai-Keung, a lecturer at Hong Kong Polytechnic, says in the 1990s, the salary starting point of fresh graduates was around HK$25,000 ($3,188; £2,594). Nowadays he says it is maybe just HK$28,000. Mr Chan published a report looking at wage growth and living costs for Hong Kong's youth over the last 30 years. He found that while starting salaries have stagnated, property prices have gone up tenfold. "Our education programme is old fashioned," Mr Chan told me. "Our economy is dominated by a handful of powerful families, who made a fortune in the property market. They are reluctant to invest in high tech industries or innovative ideas. "Our government pays lip service to the high-tech development. Even if young people want to get into this new industry there's not a lot of good chances for them." Homes out of reach Those bleak job prospects have meant that things like buying a home are out of reach for most Hong Kongers, except for the lucky few - like Karide Chow. A tech worker with an international firm in the city, she borrowed money from her mother to buy a flat with her brother. "It's quite difficult to own a home in Hong Kong and the prices of the apartments [kept] rising in the past few years," she tells me. "That's why we chose to buy the flat this year, because the prices will keep going up." Her flat set her back more than $500,000 and measures a tight 276 sq feet (25 sq m). She, her brother and her boyfriend will all live in it together - something that she says is not unusual because of how costly property is here. Hong Kong is one of the most expensive places in the world to own a home according to UBS's Real Estate Bubble Index. Prices have doubled since 2008, and according to Hong Kong's Census and Statistics department, less than half of Hong Kong's households owned their own home in 2017, the lowest figure in 20 years. Public housing estates were meant to be the solution, but there aren't enough of them. Part of the problem is that property developers who are holding onto unused land banks aren't incentivised to build public housing. "If they develop [the land] into residential housing on a private basis, they fetch ten times as much," Stanley Wong, the former chairman of Hong Kong's Taskforce on Land Supply tells me. "For public rental housing - they would then lower the profit to roughly about five times as much. Land supply in any nation is the government's responsibility. "I must say in the last ten or fifteen years the government hasn't been bold enough to make sure that we will meet land supply in the medium term." Lack of political will Hong Kong has one of the lowest tax rates in the world, which has helped it become a major financial hub. Those low tax rates though have meant that the government has had to find other ways to fund education, housing and health programmes. Traditionally it has relied on revenue from land sales to developers for commercial projects - but that means there's little incentive for the government to free up land for public housing. The other issue is the complicated makeup of Hong Kong's legislative council, the 70-member body that votes on how public money should be spent. It's dominated by business groups who have typically voted in their own interests. Hong Kong was a city built for business. But while businesses thrived, others were left out. A lack of government planning has contributed to the highest inequality rate in Hong Kong in 45 years. The government now recognises it needs to fix things - but it may be too little, too late.
The initiative, which is called Time's Up, was announced via a full-page advert printed in the New York Times. The Hollywood project is described as a "unified call for change from women in entertainment for women everywhere". It comes in the wake of sexual abuse allegations by high-profile actresses against film producer Harvey Weinstein. Legal funding The campaign, which is backed by hundreds of actresses including Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon, Cate Blanchett, Eva Longoria and Emma Stone, has already raised more than $13m (£9.6m) of its $15m target. The money raised will be used to fund legal support for both female and male victims of sexual harassment at work. The project is aimed primarily at those who are unable to meet the payments to defend themselves, such as agricultural or factory workers, caretakers and waitresses. In a "solidarity letter" published on its website, Time's Up says the "struggle for women to break in, to rise up the ranks and to simply be heard" must end, adding: "Time's up on this impenetrable monopoly." The letter, which is aimed at "every woman... who has had to fend off sexual advances", goes on to say that such harassment can often continue because "perpetrators and employers never face any consequences". It also calls for "gender inequality and the imbalance of power" to be addressed, stressing the need for more women to gain positions of authority and parity of pay. In December, Time magazine named "the Silence Breakers" - women and men who spoke out against sexual abuse and harassment - as its "Person of the Year" for 2017. Last year also saw the rise of the #MeToo hashtag, which inspired a global movement of women and men to share their stories of sexual abuse and harassment. The term gained momentum after actress Alyssa Milano took to Twitter to ask victims of sexual assault to come forward in a show of solidarity. Between October and December 2017, the hashtag was used on Twitter and Facebook more than six million times.
Last month officers were contacted by Freedom Charity after it received a call from a woman saying she had been held against her will for decades. A Malaysian woman, 69, an Irish woman, 57, and a British woman, 30, were rescued from the house on 25 October. A man, 73, and woman, 67, were held in Lambeth and bailed until January. Delayed arrest The women, who are said to be "highly traumatised", were found following delicate phone conversations between the charity and the 57-year-old, who had secretly gained access to a phone. There followed a number of phone conversations over a week, and the three woman eventually left the property when the owners of the house were not around, the charity said. They were met by police and representatives from the group, and were then moved to a safe location. The 30-year-old had spent her whole life in captivity. Officers are trying to establish whether she was born in the house. Police said the relationship between the women was being investigated. Det Insp Kevin Hyland, from the Metropolitan Police's Human Trafficking Unit, said: "We have seen some cases when people have been held for 10 years, but we have never seen anything of this magnitude before." He added that the women had controlled lives and spent most of it indoors, but they had some freedom. Mr Hyland said: "The women were released as soon as possible. "There was a delay in the arrest. This was down to the fact that we had to work very carefully with these people who were highly traumatised and it was very difficult to establish the facts. "The last thing we wanted to do was increase that trauma." Police said the facts behind the situation were being slowly established as specialist workers were assisting the women. Officers said there was no evidence of sexual abuse. "A television documentary on forced marriages relating to the work of Freedom Charity was the catalyst that prompted one of the victims to call for help," Mr Hyland said. 'Ordinary' street The phone call to the charity was made by the Irish woman on 18 October who said two others were being held with her. The charity contacted the police the same day and the information was passed on to the Met Police's Human Trafficking Unit on 21 October. Further inquiries revealed the location of the house, and after "sensitive negotiations" by the charity the women agreed to meet with police at a location on 25 October. The Irish woman and the British woman met the police and charity workers and showed the officers where they were being held. The 69-year-old Malaysian woman was rescued from the house and the trio were taken to a safe place. Police said the two people arrested were not British nationals and it was "very unlikely" that the alleged victims were related to the suspects because of their nationalities. Speaking to the BBC, Aneeta Prem, founder of Freedom Charity, said it was investigating how the women had remained hidden for so long. "In a very busy capital city we often don't know our neighbours. We're looking at people who were kept against their will in an ordinary residential street in central London," she said. 'Incredibly brave' Ms Prem said of the initial contact with the Irish woman: "She said she had been held against her will. "She was able to use a phone but that was done in a very secret way, the people in the house didn't know she had it. "It was a process of just over a week where there was lots of phone calls and they gained the trust of the charity, and by doing that they felt confident to reveal enough information, and obviously the police were involved, and they managed to walk out of the house when nobody was around. "We were waiting for them with the police and we managed to get them to a place of safety. "They have absolutely nothing now and as a charity we're trying to support them. "It was a very emotional time, when we got the message they were outside the front door the whole call centre erupted in cheers and there were tears, and everyone was incredibly emotional to know we had helped to rescue three ladies who had been held in such horrific conditions." Ms Prem said the two people arrested were considered the "heads of the family". A Home Office spokesman said: "The home secretary is shocked by this appalling case and while the police need to get to the bottom of exactly what happened here, the home secretary has made clear her determination to tackle the scourge of modern slavery." MP Frank Field, chairman of the modern slavery bill evidence review and vice-chairman of the human trafficking foundation, said: "It was incredibly brave for one of the victims to call for help - much more needs to be done to help victims come forward."
The Driven group also plans to try out a fleet of autonomous vehicles between London and Oxford. The cars will communicate with each other about any hazards and should operate with almost full autonomy - but will have a human on board as well. Previous tests of driverless vehicles in the UK have mainly taken place at slow speeds and not on public roads. The Driven consortium is led by Oxbotica, which makes software for driverless vehicles. Founder Prof Paul Newman, of Oxford University, said: "We're moving from the singleton autonomous vehicle to fleets of autonomous vehicles - and what's interesting is what data the vehicles share with one another, when, and why." The project is backed by an £8.6m government grant and involves an insurance company, which will assess the risks involved at each stage of the journey. The UK government has committed about £100m in total towards autonomous driving projects and has said it wants Britain to "lead the way in developing" the tech. But one expert said the country risks falling behind what is being done abroad. "Britain is trying to keep up, but the big development in the field is going on elsewhere," said Prof David Bailey from Aston Business School. "That includes Google in the US, Volvo in China and Daimler in Germany. "And amounts being committed [by the UK] are relatively small beer. "The Obama government, for example, proposed spending billions of dollars over 10 years." Calum Chace, author of Surviving AI, agreed that the UK appears to have fallen behind. "I don't know why we have to wait until 2019," he said. "But in a way it doesn't matter how aggressively the UK pushes this tech. When the US does this large-scale technology we will have to adopt it too. "It will save so many lives and so much money."
The motto of the Games is, 'inspire a generation'. What aspect of the Games has inspired you? The success of London 2012 has been uplifting for many people. BBC News website readers have been inspired to compose these poems: Kathy Holland, Bradford, UK Watching the Olympics at home on my TV Couldn't get a ticket, wasn't meant to be It doesn't really matter have enjoyed it just the same So many screens to choose from Making my Olympic Games. My lounge has been a stadium, In sea, on sand, in pool A velodrome, a football pitch What is the offside rule? So many sporting delights to watch In our green and pleasant land Showing off its beauty With such pride we can all stand United as a nation Britain rules the waves Thank you so much BBC A blinder you have played. Bill Bennett, Grays, Essex, UK They said we won't be ready They said it's doomed to fail They said we'll never cope with it There'll be chaos on road and rail Now two weeks on it's all but done The Olympic torch is spent So let's look back on the last two weeks And see just how it went: First we had the torch relay Roads lined with passionate Brits A hint of something special perhaps Runners in bright white kits. A tour around the country To invoke the Olympic dream Our thoughts begin to turn To our Olympic team. Then we had the opening A wonderful affair A history of our Island With music, dance and flair The countries then paraded The stadium soon filled The Olympic Oath was taken The very air seemed stilled. The greatest athletes in the world All gathered in one place Each one hoping to win a gold In their event or race Then 16 days of wonder, Each athlete giving their all The sweat, the pain, the tears In search of their ultimate goal Team GB are in their stride The medals start to mount Our hearts begin to fill with pride As we watch the medal count Farrah, Murray, Ennis Surely Britain at its best Mckeever, Wiggins, Hoy Each pass the ultimate test A truly great Olympics The best we've ever seen A nation now united By our own Olympic dream. But now it's almost over The Olympic games are spent I wonder if we'll look back and wonder Where the pessimists went? Gill Swain, Truro, UK Exhaustion and ache and early dawn break; a track to pound, a circuit to round, new strengths to be found In rain, fog and storm, rise up from the warm; tasks to complete, seconds to beat, new personal feat Hours alone, longing for home; a life on hold, a force unfold, a time to be bold A sense of right, the challenge to fight; with sabres, with bow, with paddles to row A relentless drive, the will to thrive; a timely skill, a handstand still, a dive to thrill From finish line sights and equine heights; a race to be run, a hammer spun, a clear round won But when each of them strive, who can measure the drive of those destined to hold, these medals tri-fold ; Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Jonny Benjamin, Manchester, UK This Isle of Wonder, Majestic in its glory; United amongst its people, Witnessing a story To be passed down to the next generation; The pride of a nation, Joined together through a single flame, The heart of the Olympic games. This Isle of Wonder, On which heroes have been born and bred; To whom our hearts have been lifted, And our tears have been shed; Must herald the dawn of a new age of aspiration, To be handed down to the next generation. For never in our minds should we erase, The spectacle that every single Olympian gave, To this Isle of Wonder, And to the World that has seen, The greatest sportspeople on earth, Fight for all they ever dreamed. This is the stuff to inspire each next generation, Long after the Games fade in their celebration. For together we witnessed the greatest show on Earth, And greater than gold has this show been worth.
There were reductions in nearly all the main categories of crime including violence, but sexual offences rose 1%. Separate data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales showed the number of crimes had fallen 9% since a year ago. And the Home Office said the number of police officers had fallen to below 130,000 - 4,500 fewer than last year. Prime Minister David Cameron hailed the figures as "good news" at a time of police cuts and thanked the service for its efforts. "We have asked them to do more with less resources. They have performed, I think, magnificently," he said. Labour welcomed the figures, but said there was "worrying evidence" the service provided by the police was "being hollowed out" with cuts to the number of officers. Despite the wider drop in recorded crime, one of the main categories to rise was "theft from the person" - including pick-pocketing and snatching of bags and mobile phones - up 9%. 'Great tribute' The stealing of phones out of people's hands as they walk along the street was a particular issue in London, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. Fraud offences have also seen a big rise, up 27%. Officials suggested this was due to changes in the way fraud was recorded, with a more centralised approach. The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said it was also an indication more fraud was being committed online. Statisticians attributed the rise in sexual offences to the "Yewtree effect" - referring to Scotland Yard's operation set up after the Jimmy Savile scandal. They suggested the number of sexual offences reported could continue to rise over the coming months, as people come forward to report historic offences. The Crime Survey, which is based on people's experience of crime and includes offences which aren't reported, now shows offending is at its lowest level since the survey began in 1981. Our correspondent said levels of crime had been falling since the mid 1990s, but there were some indications the decrease may now be slowing. On LBC Radio, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said falling crime figures were "one of the great triumphs of recent years" and "a great tribute to the police". The Home Office has also released figures on the number of police officers, showing there were 129,584 officers at the end of March - 14,000 fewer than in 2010 and the lowest number of officers since 2002. Officer numbers fell in 37 of the 43 forces last year - with the largest percentage decreases in the City of London force and Staffordshire. In the Met there were 1,742 fewer officers. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper welcomed the fall in crime, which she said was in line with longer-term trends. She added: "The police are doing an impressive job in increasingly difficult circumstances... but Acpo have warned that the full effect of the cuts is not yet being felt. "As the government has made it so much harder for the police, they should not try to take credit for the work the police and communities are doing."

She died in 2016. Education: Vassar College and Cornell University. Known for: A pioneering US astronomer and a champion of female scientists. Scientific achievements: Her work confirmed the existence of a type of invisible matter known as dark matter. In 1974, she helped provide evidence that the stars at the edges of galaxies move faster than expected. To reconcile her observations with the law of gravity, scientists proposed there was matter we cannot see and called it dark matter. Her studies earned her numerous honours, including being the second female astronomer to be elected to the US National Academy of Sciences.

Scientific achievements: She joined Cern in 1994, where she worked on the Atlas experiment, which pinpointed the Higgs, the sub-atomic particle that helps give mass to the building blocks of nature. She now leads the organisation, which is home to 10,000 scientists from more than 100 nationalities. Jocelyn Bell Burnell, British astrophysicist Birthplace: Born in 1943 in Lurgan, Northern Ireland. Education: York, Glasgow and Cambridge universities. Known for: Discovery of pulsars - a type of neutron star that emits a beam of radiation. Scientific achievements: As a research student at Cambridge University's Cavendish laboratory, she was looking at data from a new radio telescope she helped to build when she spotted a faint and unusual signal: repeating pulses of radio waves. Her observation, made together with her supervisor, Antony Hewish, in 1967, is considered to be one of the greatest astronomical discoveries of the 20th Century. Hewish received the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physics for his "decisive role in the discovery of pulsars", but she was not included in the citation. Follow Helen on Twitter.
By Angela Harrison Education correspondent, BBC News The study, by High Fliers Research, says there will be a 9% rise in this recruitment - about 1,400 extra jobs. Many of the jobs will go to people who have already worked for the organisations, either on work experience or placement, it suggests. Previous forecasts have been less optimistic. According to the study, the increase in what is known as entry-level graduate employment is the biggest in four years among this group of employers. Average starting salaries are £29,000 a year, with higher amounts being paid by investment banks (£45,000) and law firms (£39,000). Among the highest starting salaries for this year are at the European Commission and the supermarket chain Aldi, both offering rates of about £41,000. 'Significant increase' The study says two-thirds of the employers are offering "paid work-experience programmes" for students and recent graduates, with more than 11,000 paid placements this year for first and second-year undergraduates. In all, 37% of this year's entry-level positions are set to be taken by people who have already worked with the organisations in some capacity. The largest recruiters of graduates in 2014 will be the charity Teach First, which takes on top graduates to be trained as teachers. It has 1,550 vacancies. It is followed by financial services groups PwC (1,200 vacancies) and Deloitte (1,000 vacancies). Martin Birchall, managing director of High Fliers Research, said: "This very significant increase in graduate vacancies at Britain's top employers means the job prospects for graduates leaving university this year are the best they've been since the start of the recession seven years ago." A study last year from the Association of Graduate Recruiters was less optimistic, forecasting a 4% fall in graduate vacancies. Nationally, about one person in 10 is believed to be out of work six months after leaving university, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa). Among those who graduated in 2012, average wages were £21,000 a year for men and £19,000 for women. About a third were working in sectors that did not require a degree, according to Hesa.
The official Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) was up to 50.1 from February's 49.9, and higher than economists' forecasts of 49.7. A reading above 50 points shows an expansion in activity in the sector, while one below indicates contraction. China has cut interest rates twice since November among other measures to boost economic activity. However, a private survey of the sector showed a much dimmer outlook, indicating that activity had contracted this month. The final HSBC/Markit PMI came in at 49.6, slightly higher than a preliminary "flash" reading of 49.2 released earlier in March. Weaker economy Despite the contradicting surveys, economists said both continued to show the persistent weakness in the world's second-largest economy. The Asian giant has been impacted by a downturn in its once red-hot property market, overcapacity in factory production and high levels of local debt, which contributed to growth of 7.4% in 2014 - a 24-year low. Economists are now expecting growth to slow to around 7% this year. On top of the manufacturing data, figures on China's services industry also added to concerns about slowing growth. The official services PMI cooled in March, hovering around one-year lows. The non-manufacturing index fell to 53.7 from February's 53.9, at the one-year low hit in January. The service sector, which was expanding strongly last year while manufacturing struggled, accounted for over 48% of the economy in 2014, up from about 47% in 2013, according to Reuters.
The 27-year-old X Factor judge and Girls Aloud star was admitted to hospital after reports she had fainted during a photoshoot at the weekend. On Monday, it was confirmed Cole had cancelled all of her work commitments this week on the advice of doctors. Cole recently returned from a break in Tanzania, on the east coast of Africa, with friend and dancer Derek Hough. Her spokesman confirmed she had been taking anti-malaria tablets while on holiday. Mosquito bite The Sun reported Cole collapsed at a photoshoot for her second solo album on Saturday and was diagnosed with exhaustion and gastroenteritis. The early symptoms of malaria include a headache, aching muscles and weakness or a lack of energy. This means it can be confused for other conditions like exhaustion or flu. Malaria is transmitted by an infected mosquito and it only takes one bite to contract the disease. Simon Cowell is currently filming the audition stage of ITV talent show The X Factor with Cole. He told the singer: "Don't rush back. Health is a priority and get some rest to recover properly." An X Factor spokeswoman said an audition in Manchester would go ahead as planned on Friday with a judging panel of Cowell, Louis Walsh and Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger, who is standing in for a heavily-pregnant Dannii Minogue. Cole, alongside other celebrities, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro for charity in March last year. The group raised £3.5 million for Comic Relief for use in Africa and the UK. Turbulent year Some of the money raised is helping to tackle malaria. In Africa, one in every five childhood deaths is due to the effects of the disease. Comic Relief chief executive Kevin Cahill said it was "deeply unfair" that Cole had caught malaria after the star had "done more than her bit" to help prevent the disease. He said: "We're very sorry to learn that Cheryl has been diagnosed with malaria and wish her a speedy recovery. "Cheryl did an amazing thing climbing Kilimanjaro last year and raising millions to buy bed nets for thousands of families and children in Africa - the first step to preventing malaria," he added. Cole's ill health comes during a turbulent year for the star. She split from her husband, England footballer Ashley Cole, in February and filed for divorce three months later. Since then, she has been kept busy touring as a solo act for the first time, supporting hip-hop band Black Eyed Peas, and recording her second album. The Girls Aloud star is also scheduled to play high-profile shows at the V Festival in August.
Latest figures show net migration rose to 176,000 - up from 153,000 people in the year to September 2012. The increase appears to buck the trend of a decline in net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to and leaving the country. Prime Minister David Cameron wants to get UK net migration below 100,000 before the next election in 2015. The increase was driven by a change in the number of people who left Britain. In the year to September 2012, 342,000 moved abroad. But fewer people left the UK in the year to December 2012. Over the same period, the number of immigrants arriving in the country remained virtually unchanged. The difference between these two factors meant that net migration rose - although it did not climb back above the level it was at in December 2011. 'Out of options' Immigration minister Mark Harper said net migration was however down by a third since its peak in 2010. He added that a new immigration bill coming into force in the autumn would make it more difficult for people to come into Britain if they had no right to do so and would make it easier to remove people who were not entitled to stay in the country. "We are committed to bringing net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands," Mr Harper said. "We are working across government to protect public services and ensure our welfare system is not open to abuse." Shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said the figures were "a blow" to the home secretary. "Theresa May's focus on net migration, which has gone wrong in these figures, has also meant the government is failing badly on illegal immigration, which is a major concern to the public and is getting worse and worse with fewer people being stopped at the border, absconsions up and deportations down. "Immigration needs to be controlled, but we must recognise there is immigration that works for Britain and immigration that doesn't." But the pressure group Migrationwatch UK said that the detail of the latest figures showed the government was succeeding in cutting immigration from outside the EU - and that further reductions in net migration could come by ensuring that people leave when they should. Sir Andrew Green, Migrationwatch's chairman, said: "It is far too early on the basis of one quarter's figures to call this a setback to the government's policy. Student interviews and measures to ensure that students leave when they should will make a substantial difference." Sarah Mulley, of the centre-left think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the statistics suggested the government was running out of options to meet its target. "Recent declines have been driven in large part by falling numbers of international students, which has come at a high economic cost, but this trend now appears to be levelling off," she said. Other figures released in the report include:
Researchers at King's College London, in collaboration with the University of Suffolk, tested 15 different locations across Suffolk. Their report said cocaine was found in all samples tested. Other illicit drugs, such as ketamine, were also widespread in the shrimp. The researchers said it was a "surprising" finding. Professor Nic Bury, from the University of Suffolk, said: "Whether the presence of cocaine in aquatic animals is an issue for Suffolk, or more widespread an occurrence in the UK and abroad, awaits further research. "Environmental health has attracted much attention from the public due to challenges associated with climate change and microplastic pollution. "However, the impact of 'invisible' chemical pollution (such as drugs) on wildlife health needs more focus in the UK." The study, published in Environment International, looked at the exposure of wildlife, such as the freshwater shrimp Gammarus pulex, to different micropollutants. Researchers collected the samples from the rivers Alde, Box, Deben, Gipping and Waveney. They said in addition to the drugs, banned pesticides and pharmaceuticals were also widespread in the shrimp that were collected. The potential for any effect on the creatures was "likely to be low", they said. Dr Leon Barron, from King's College London, said: "Such regular occurrence of illicit drugs in wildlife was surprising. "We might expect to see these in urban areas such as London, but not in smaller and more rural catchments. "The presence of pesticides which have long been banned in the UK also poses a particular challenge as the sources of these remain unclear."
People have defected from North Korean restaurants overseas before but this is the first mass escape from the same one, a South Korean official said. Overseas North Korean workers are usually thought to be chosen largely because of their loyalty. North Korean defections are a bitter point of contention between the two Koreas. Pyongyang has accused Seoul of enticing North Korean citizens to defect, something Seoul denies. South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon Hee said one man and 12 women arrived in the South on Thursday. Mr Jeong did not reveal where they were working to avoid causing diplomatic rifts or endangering North Koreans still working in the country. According to a staff member at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Danang, Vietnam, a North Korean restaurant there recently closed down and all staff left the country, the Associated Press reported. It could not confirm a link to the defections. North Korea is reported to run an estimated 130 restaurants in other countries, primarily in Asia, providing essential hard currency for the regime. Seoul believes the restaurants have been struggling since new sanctions were applied on Pyongyang following a recent nuclear test. The defectors said they learned about the South by watching South Korean TV dramas online and began to distrust North Korean propaganda, Mr Jeong said. The Unification Ministry's website says more than 29,000 North Koreans have defected to South Korea as of March. North Korea's restaurant empire Where are they? Where does the money go? Who are the staff and how are they treated?
The firm said in an official filing that it expected to price its shares at between $66 and $68 a share, up from its earlier price range of $60 to $66 a share. The increase suggests demand for the firm's shares are high. Its listing is expected this week. Alibaba would have a market value of up to $168bn based on the new price range, making it larger than Amazon. Alibaba plans to use the proceeds from the listing to expand in the US and Europe, founder Jack Ma said on Monday. Record listing Alibaba's flotation was already expected to be the largest listing in the US, overtaking the Agricultural Bank of China's 2010 flotation which raised $22.1bn. Alibaba accounts for 80% of all online retail sales in China. Its sites also include Taobao, Tmall, and AliExpress. The company is selling 123.1 million of the 320.1 million shares in the IPO. Meanwhile, selling shareholders, including founder Jack Ma, Yahoo and executive vice chairman Joe Tsai, are offering the rest. Rising internet usage in China and a growing and affluent middle-class helped the firm make a profit of almost $2bn in the three months to the end of June, with sales up by 46% year-on-year to $2.54bn.
By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The filing is one of several of its kind involving leading Chinese technology companies, discovered by a US research company and shared with BBC News. Huawei had previously said none of its technologies was designed to identify ethnic groups. It now plans to alter the patent. Forced-labour camps The company indicated this would involve asking the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) - the country's patent authority - for permission to delete the reference to Uighurs in the Chinese-language document. Uighur people belong to a mostly Muslim ethnic group that lives mainly in Xinjiang province, in north-western China. Government authorities are accused of using high-tech surveillance against them and detaining many in forced-labour camps, where children are sometimes separated from their parents. Beijing says the camps offer voluntary education and training. "One technical requirement of the Chinese Ministry of Public Security's video-surveillance networks is the detection of ethnicity - particularly of Uighurs," said Maya Wang, from Human Rights Watch. "While in the rest of the world, such targeting and persecution of a people on the basis of their ethnicity would be completely unacceptable, the persecution and severe discrimination of Uighurs in many aspects of life in China remain unchallenged because Uighurs have no power in China." Body movements Huawei's patent was originally filed in July 2018, in conjunction with the Chinese Academy of Sciences . It describes ways to use deep-learning artificial-intelligence techniques to identify various features of pedestrians photographed or filmed in the street. It focuses on addressing the fact different body postures - for example whether someone is sitting or standing - can affect accuracy. But the document also lists attributes by which a person might be targeted, which it says can include "race (Han [China's biggest ethnic group], Uighur)". A spokesman said this reference should not have been included. "Huawei opposes discrimination of all types, including the use of technology to carry out ethnic discrimination," he said. "Identifying individuals' race was never part of the research-and-development project. "It should never have become part of the application. "And we are taking proactive steps to amend it. "We are continuously working to ensure new and evolving technology is developed and applied with the utmost care and integrity." 'Confidential' document The patent was brought to light by the video-surveillance research group IPVM. It had previously flagged a separate "confidential" document on Huawei's website, referencing work on a "Uighur alert" system. In that case, Huawei said the page referenced a test rather than a real-world application and denied selling systems that identified people by their ethnicity. On Wednesday, Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the UK Parliament's Foreign Affairs Select Committee and leads the Conservative Party's China Research Group, told BBC News: "Chinese tech giants supporting the brutal assault on the Uighur population show us why we as consumers and as a society must be careful with who we buy our products from or award business to. "Developing ethnic-labelling technology for use by a repressive regime is clearly not behaviour that lives up to our standards." Facial-recognition software IPVM also discovered references to Uighur people in patents filed by the Chinese artificial-intelligence company Sensetime and image-recognition specialist Megvii. Sensetime's filing, from July 2019, discusses ways facial-recognition software could be used for more efficient "security protection", such as searching for "a middle-aged Uighur with sunglasses and a beard" or a Uighur person wearing a mask. A Sensetime spokeswoman said the references were "regrettable". "We understand the importance of our responsibilities, which is why we began to develop our AI Code of Ethics in mid-2019," she said, adding the patent had predated this code. Ethnic-labelling solutions Megvii's June 2019 patent, meanwhile, described a way of relabelling pictures of faces tagged incorrectly in a database. It said the classifications could be based on ethnicity, for example, including "Han, Uighur, non-Han, non-Uighur and unknown". The company told BBC News it would now withdraw the patent application. "Megvii recognises that the language used in our 2019 patent application is open to misunderstanding," it said. "Megvii has not developed and will not develop or sell racial- or ethnic-labelling solutions. "Megvii acknowledges that, in the past, we have focused on our commercial development and lacked appropriate control of our marketing, sales, and operations materials. "We are undertaking measures to correct the situation." Attribute-recognition model IPVM also flagged image-recognition patents filed by two of China's biggest technology conglomerates, Alibaba and Baidu, that referenced classifying people by ethnicity but did not specifically mention the Uighur people by name. Alibaba responded: "Racial or ethnic discrimination or profiling in any form violates our policies and values. "We never intended our technology to be used for and will not permit it to be used for targeting specific ethnic groups." And Baidu said: "When filing for a patent, the document notes are meant as an example of a technical explanation, in this case describing what the attribute-recognition model is rather than representing the expected implementation of the invention. "We do not and will not permit our technology to be used to identify or target specific ethnic groups." But Human Rights Watch said it still had concerns. "Any company that sells video-surveillance software and systems to the Chinese police would have to ensure that they meet the police's requirements, which includes the capacity for ethnicity detection," Ms Wang said. "The right thing for these companies to do is to immediately cease their sale and maintenance of surveillance equipment, software and systems, to the Chinese police."
The Kuomintang party (KMT) appears to have lost control of districts across the country, including the mayor's office in the capital, Taipei. Saturday's polls were widely seen as a referendum on relations with China. KMT supporters had argued for good relations with China, which views Taiwan as a renegade province. China and Taiwan, a close US ally, have been ruled separately since the end of a civil war in 1949. Analysis: Cindy Sui, BBC News, Taipei The defeat suffered by the KMT reflects voter dissatisfaction over the government's handling of food safety scandals, low wages and the widening wealth gap. It also reflects worries over its pro-China policy. Although trade deals with China have brought benefits to Taiwan, there is a sense that they have helped mostly companies, not ordinary people. For them life has not got better since KMT President Ma Ying-jeou came into office in 2008. Instead, there are worries that closer ties with China will ultimately hurt Taiwan's independence - by making the island too economically dependent on its neighbour and vulnerable to pressures to reunify. The KMT will now face an uphill battle in the 2016 presidential and legislative races. The question now is whether China will try to find ways to work with the DPP, a party it has long distrusted due to its support for Taiwan's independence. And will the DPP soften its stance ahead of the presidential vote? Either way, a stalemate is likely in the short-term. Bowing out Mr Jiang told reporters he was stepping down in order to take responsibility for the defeat. Moments later, President Ma Ying-jeou, who is also KMT chairman, apologised to supporters "for making everyone disappointed". "I've received the message people have sent via these elections," President Ma told a news conference. "It's my responsibility and I will quickly offer a party reform plan to address everyone's demands. I won't avoid responsibility." The race in the capital was watched with particular attention as a test of Mr Ma's pro-China policy. In the event, an independent opposition-backed candidate, Ko Wen-je, claimed victory over the KMT's Sean Lien. Mr Lien publicly bowed in defeat along with his solemn-faced supporters. "We congratulate Mr Ko," he said in his concession speech. "I'm sorry I didn't win this election." Lin Wen-chih, 48, a film producer who voted for Mr Ko, told AP: "We want to send the nationalists [KMT] a warning. Taiwan is an independent country. We don't want the nationalists to take measures that would have it eaten up [by China]." More than 18 million eligible voters were registered to vote, choosing from among 20,000 candidates who were running for more than 11,000 positions. Dependence fears Some voters distrust the KMT, regardless of whether the deals signed with Beijing are good for Taiwan, the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei reports. KMT supporters, on the other hand, feel that Taiwan needs good relations with its biggest trade partner to breathe new life into the island's ailing economy. They feared a victory by the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) could cause relations with China and Taiwan's economy to regress, our correspondent says. The DPP supports Taiwan's formal independence from China, something Beijing strongly opposes. In 2016, Taiwan will hold the more important presidential and legislative polls. Taiwan began allowing truly democratic elections - with opposition party candidates and universal suffrage - in the late 1980s.
Jordan Hill, Brittany Covington and Tesfaye Cooper, all 18, and 24-year-old Tanishia Covington are expected to appear in a Chicago court on Friday. In the video, the assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and Donald Trump. Chicago police have described the incident as "sickening". Torture video prompts online race fight Cook County prosecutors have also charged the suspects with aggravated unlawful restraint and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon. Mr Hill is further charged with robbery and possession of a stolen motor. All the suspects, apart from Tanishia Covington, each face an additional count of residential burglary. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said the attack demonstrates "a level of depravity that is an outrage to a lot of Americans". He said he has not yet spoken to Barack Obama about the incident in his hometown of Chicago, but added that he is certain the president would be angry. Police said the unnamed 18-year-old victim was dropped off by his parents at a McDonald's restaurant on 31 December to meet his friend, Jordan Hill, who later became one of his attackers. The pair drove around for two days, sleeping inside a van that Mr Hill had allegedly stolen without the victim's knowledge, before ending up at the Covington sisters' home. Police said a play fight led to a prolonged assault in a flat on the Illinois city's west side. The captive was made to drink from a toilet bowl, had part of his scalp removed with a knife, and was bound, gagged and beaten. Chicago Police Commander Kevin Duffin said the victim finally escaped when his attackers went downstairs to confront a resident who had called police because of the noise. Cdr Duffin said the racial slurs and references to the victim's mental capacity, depicted in the video, led to the hate crime charges. One of the female attackers allegedly kicked in the front door of the neighbour's home, resulting in burglary charges for three of the suspects. The escaped captive was found disorientated and traumatised, walking the streets in shorts and sandals with Mr Hill. The victim, who had difficulty communicating with police, was taken to hospital for medical treatment, and discharged. More on violence in Chicago "I've been a cop for 28 years," said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson earlier, "and I've seen things that you shouldn't see in a lifetime, but it still amazes me how you still see things that you just shouldn't." In the 30-minute video, the attackers can also be seen cutting the victim's clothes, dropping cigarette ash on him and pushing his head back with a foot. Several people can be seen drinking, laughing and smoking, while their captive cowers in the corner of the room. In other videos posted online the young man is forced at knife-point to say: "I love black people". An African-American woman talks to the camera, sometimes with slurred speech. But the grandmother of one of the young women charged said her granddaughter is "a good person" who has had her "ups and downs". Priscilla Covington said the video does not reflect the young woman she said she had raised since she was a baby. The incident has provoked a strong reaction on Twitter, especially among the alt-right - the fringe group whose members celebrated US President-elect Trump's election win with Nazi salutes.
Sirens were sounded at the same moment as the first explosion at the reactor, in the early hours of 26 April 1986. The meltdown at the Soviet plant was the worst nuclear disaster in history. An uncontrolled reaction blew the roof off, spewing out a cloud of radioactive material which drifted into other parts of the USSR, including Russia and Belarus, and northern Europe. Relatives of those who died attended candle-lit vigils at several churches, including at Slavutych, a town built to re-house workers who lived near the nuclear plant. A series of events are being held throughout the day. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko laid a wreath and observed a minute's silence in the Ukrainian capital Kiev before heading north for a ceremony at the plant itself, not far from the Belarussian border. "We honour those who lost their health and require a special attention from the government and society," he said in a speech in Chernobyl. "It's with an everlasting pain in our hearts that we remember those who lost their lives to fight nuclear death." He also said the nuclear disaster had been Ukraine's biggest challenge between the Nazi occupation in World War Two and the recent conflict in eastern Ukraine, which he described as "Russian aggression". "At a time when we still need immense resources to tackle the consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, when we need funding for social support to fire-fighters and victims, we have to spend almost one-fifth of our budget expenses on defence and security," he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in a message to the 600,000 people who helped in the clear-up - known as liquidators - called the nuclear disaster "a grave lesson for all of mankind". Etched in Ukraine's consciousness: analysis by Tom Burridge, Chernobyl Chernobyl is not a historical event in Ukraine but a living reality for an unquantifiable number of people. For the people who were evacuated after the disaster and separated from their families. For the estimated 180 residents who still live inside the 30km exclusion zone. For the army of workers who go there every day to continue work to secure the site, by constructing the giant shield-like structure which will be moved over reactor 4 later this year. Work to remove the radioactive contents of the reactor could take decades. Then there are those who died in the immediate aftermath of the accident. Their loved ones still mourn. And finally there is the highly contentious issue of how many people have died, or suffered illnesses, particularly cancers, because of exposure to high levels of radiation. That debate will probably never be resolved. The attempted cover-up by the Soviet authorities in 1986 further discredited rule by Moscow. And 30 years on, Chernobyl is etched into the consciousness of an independent Ukraine. Vasyl Markin, who had been working in Chernobyl at the time of the disaster, attended the midnight vigil in Slavutych. "This tragedy will stay with us till the end of our lives," he said. "I won't be able to forget it anyway." Some former residents returned to the area, now derelict and overgrown, ahead of the anniversary. Zoya Perevozchenko, 66, had lived in Pripyat, the town inhabited by Chernobyl workers which was abandoned in the wake of the accident. She told Reuters news agency: "I barely found my apartment, I mean it's a forest now - trees growing through the pavement, on the roofs. All the rooms are empty, the glass is gone from the windows and everything's destroyed." Levels of radioactivity remain high in the surrounding area. A charity, Bridges to Belarus, is warning that a number of babies in a region close to Ukraine's border are still being born with serious deformities, while an unusually high rate of people have rare forms of cancer. Donors around the world pledged €87.5m (£68m; $99m) on Monday towards a new underground nuclear waste facility in the region. Ukraine will need to commit a further €10m in order to complete the new storage site. Work began in 2010 on a 25,000-tonne, €2.1bn sarcophagus to seal the uranium left in the damaged reactor, thought to be about 200 tonnes. Experts fear that if parts of the aging reactor collapse, further radioactive material could be spewed into the atmosphere. Ukrainian press remembers Chernobyl Newspapers in Ukraine carry sombre features looking back at the disaster and discussing ways of rehabilitating the exclusion zone. Segodnya carries a picture of the Chernobyl plant on its front page and highlights plans to create a nature reserve around it. Most of the area is "clean" now, it quotes the Ukrainian environment ministry as saying. Ukraina Moloda daily also says that the area has become "safer" and is now being promoted as a tourist attraction. Its front page headline recalls that "The nuclear industry brought a lot of sorrow to Ukraine". KP v Ukraine, a tabloid, calculates the disaster's cost and reaches the conclusion that money alone is not enough to estimate it. Mortality rates jumped by as much as 40% in certain parts of Ukraine, and many families were simply afraid to have children. "The Chernobyl disaster has resulted in at least 50,000 children not being born," the paper says. The number of people killed by the disaster remains disputed. A report in 2005 by the UN-backed Chernobyl Forum concluded that fewer than 50 people had died as a result of exposure to radiation, most of them workers killed immediately after the disaster, but some survived until as late as 2004. The forum estimated up to 9,000 people could eventually die from radiation exposure, although Greenpeace claims the figure could be as high as 93,000.
By Angela Harrison Education correspondent, BBC News The study, by High Fliers Research, says there will be a 9% rise in this recruitment - about 1,400 extra jobs. Many of the jobs will go to people who have already worked for the organisations, either on work experience or placement, it suggests. Previous forecasts have been less optimistic. According to the study, the increase in what is known as entry-level graduate employment is the biggest in four years among this group of employers. Average starting salaries are £29,000 a year, with higher amounts being paid by investment banks (£45,000) and law firms (£39,000). Among the highest starting salaries for this year are at the European Commission and the supermarket chain Aldi, both offering rates of about £41,000. 'Significant increase' The study says two-thirds of the employers are offering "paid work-experience programmes" for students and recent graduates, with more than 11,000 paid placements this year for first and second-year undergraduates. In all, 37% of this year's entry-level positions are set to be taken by people who have already worked with the organisations in some capacity. The largest recruiters of graduates in 2014 will be the charity Teach First, which takes on top graduates to be trained as teachers. It has 1,550 vacancies. It is followed by financial services groups PwC (1,200 vacancies) and Deloitte (1,000 vacancies). Martin Birchall, managing director of High Fliers Research, said: "This very significant increase in graduate vacancies at Britain's top employers means the job prospects for graduates leaving university this year are the best they've been since the start of the recession seven years ago." A study last year from the Association of Graduate Recruiters was less optimistic, forecasting a 4% fall in graduate vacancies. Nationally, about one person in 10 is believed to be out of work six months after leaving university, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa). Among those who graduated in 2012, average wages were £21,000 a year for men and £19,000 for women. About a third were working in sectors that did not require a degree, according to Hesa.
However, the plight of the drought-hit South African city is just one extreme example of a problem that experts have long been warning about - water scarcity. Despite covering about 70% of the Earth's surface, water, especially drinking water, is not as plentiful as one might think. Only 3% of it is fresh. Over one billion people lack access to water and another 2.7 billion find it scarce for at least one month of the year. A 2014 survey of the world's 500 largest cities estimates that one in four are in a situation of "water stress" According to UN-endorsed projections, global demand for fresh water will exceed supply by 40% in 2030, thanks to a combination of climate change, human action and population growth. You might also be interested in: It shouldn't be a surprise, then, that Cape Town is just the tip of the iceberg. Here are the other 11 cities most likely to run out of water. 1. São Paulo Brazil's financial capital and one of the 10 most populated cities in the world went through a similar ordeal to Cape Town in 2015, when the main reservoir fell below 4% capacity. At the height of the crisis, the city of over 21.7 million inhabitants had less than 20 days of water supply and police had to escort water trucks to stop looting. It is thought a drought that affected south-eastern Brazil between 2014 and 2017 was to blame, but a UN mission to São Paulo was critical of the state authorities "lack of proper planning and investments". The water crisis was deemed "finished" in 2016, but in January 2017 the main reserves were 15% below expected for the period - putting the city's future water supply once again in doubt. 2. Bangalore Local officials in the southern Indian city have been bamboozled by the growth of new property developments following Bangalore's rise as a technological hub and are struggling to manage the city's water and sewage systems. To make matters worse, the city's antiquated plumbing needs an urgent upheaval; a report by the national government found that the city loses over half of its drinking water to waste. Like China, India struggles with water pollution and Bangalore is no different: an in-depth inventory of the city's lakes found that 85% had water that could only be used for irrigation and industrial cooling. Not a single lake had suitable water for drinking or bathing. Will Cape Town be the first city to run out of water? 3. Beijing The World Bank classifies water scarcity as when people in a determined location receive less than 1,000 cubic metres of fresh water per person a year. In 2014, each of the more than 20 million inhabitants of Beijing had only 145 cubic metres. China is home to almost 20% of the world's population but has only 7% of the world's fresh water. A Columbia University study estimates that the country's reserves declined 13% between 2000 and 2009. And there's also a pollution problem. Official figures from 2015 showed that 40% of Beijing's surface water was polluted to the point of not being useful even for agriculture or industrial use. The Chinese authorities have tried to address the problem by creating massive water diversion projects. They have also introduced educational programmes, as well as price hikes for heavy business users. 4. Cairo Once crucial to the establishment of one of the world's greatest civilisations, the River Nile is struggling in modern times. It is the source of 97% of Egypt's water but also the destination of increasing amounts of untreated agricultural, and residential waste. World Health Organization figures show that Egypt ranks high among lower middle-income countries in terms of the number of deaths related to water pollution. The UN estimates critical shortages in the country by 2025. 5. Jakarta Like many coastal cities, the Indonesian capital faces the threat of rising sea levels. But in Jakarta the problem has been made worse by direct human action. Because less than half of the city's 10 million residents have access to piped water, illegal digging of wells is rife. This practice is draining the underground aquifers, almost literally deflating them. As a consequence, about 40% of Jakarta now lies below sea level, according to World Bank estimates. To make things worse, aquifers are not being replenished despite heavy rain because the prevalence of concrete and asphalt means that open fields cannot absorb rainfall. 6. Moscow One-quarter of the world's fresh water reserves are in Russia, but the country is plagued by pollution problems caused by the industrial legacy of the Soviet era. That is specifically worrying for Moscow, where the water supply is 70% dependent on surface water. Official regulatory bodies admit that 35% to 60% of total drinking water reserves in Russia do not meet sanitary standards 7. Istanbul According to official Turkish government figures, the country is technically in a situation of a water stress, since the per capita supply fell below 1,700 cubic metres in 2016. Local experts have warned that the situation could worsen to water scarcity by 2030. In recent years, heavily populated areas like Istanbul (14 million inhabitants) have begun to experience shortages in the drier months. The city's reservoir levels declined to less than 30 percent of capacity at the beginning of 2014. 8. Mexico City Water shortages are nothing new for many of the 21 million inhabitants of the Mexican capital. One in five get just a few hours from their taps a week and another 20% have running water for just part of the day. The city imports as much as 40% of its water from distant sources but has no large-scale operation for recycling wastewater. Water losses because of problems in the pipe network are also estimated at 40%. 9. London Of all the cities in the world, London is not the first that springs to mind when one thinks of water shortages. The reality is very different. With an average annual rainfall of about 600mm (less than the Paris average and only about half that of New York), London draws 80% of its water from rivers (the Thames and Lea). According to the Greater London Authority, the city is pushing close to capacity and is likely to have supply problems by 2025 and "serious shortages" by 2040. It looks likely that hosepipe bans could become more common in the future. 10. Tokyo The Japanese capital enjoys precipitation levels similar to that of Seattle on the US west coast, which has a reputation for rain. Rainfall, however, is concentrated during just four months of the year. That water needs to be collected, as a drier-than-expected rainy season could lead to a drought. At least 750 private and public buildings in Tokyo have rainwater collection and utilisation systems. Home to more than 30 million people, Tokyo has a water system that depends 70% on surface water (rivers, lakes, and melted snow). Recent investment in the pipeline infrastructure aims also to reduce waste by leakage to only 3% in the near future. 11. Miami The US state of Florida is among the five US states most hit by rain every year. However, there is a crisis brewing in its most famous city, Miami. An early 20th Century project to drain nearby swamps had an unforeseen result; water from the Atlantic Ocean contaminated the Biscayne Aquifer, the city's main source of fresh water. Although the problem was detected in the 1930s, seawater still leaks in, especially because the American city has experienced faster rates of sea level rise, with water breaching underground defence barriers installed in recent decades. Neighbouring cities are already struggling. Hallandale Beach, which is just a few miles north of Miami, had to close six of its eight wells due to saltwater intrusion.
The drugs were found packed inside 30 suitcases on 11 September, but the operation was revealed on Saturday. France's Interior minister, Manuel Valls, said it was the biggest drug haul ever made in the Paris area. Six people were arrested, accused of being members of an international drug smuggling ring, Mr Valls said. Officials say they believe the drugs were meant for sale in France and had a street value of 200m euros (£169m; $270m). The Air France flight came from Caracas. The suitcases with the cocaine reportedly were not registered to any of the passengers.
By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News A lack of records meant some surgeons were unable to tell their patients if they were affected by the recent scare over sub-standard PIP implants. Ministers said they were cleaning up a "cowboy industry" steeped in "murky practices". Health ministers in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will decide if they are to join the register. Fresh efforts will also be made to regulate adverts to end the era of "win a boob-job" competitions. The cosmetic procedures industry has been quietly booming. It was worth £750m in the UK in 2005, £2.3bn in 2010 and is forecast to reach £3.6bn by 2015. However, the PIP implant scandal led doctors to describe the field as a poorly regulated 'Cosmetic crisis' waiting to happen. The French company Poly Implant Prothese sold faulty implants containing sub-standard silicone gel with double the rupture rate of other implants. It caused a global scare affecting 300,000 women. 'Data-free zone' A review described the UK as a "data-free zone" with a serious lack of records about which women had been given PIP implants or what had happened to them. The NHS and some private companies will trial a new system for registering implants, similar to the National Joint Registry for hip operations, before making it compulsory across England. Dr Dan Poulter, health minister for England, told the BBC: "The PIP implant scandal has shone a light on what is sometimes a cowboy industry where there are some murky practices. "What we need to do is more effectively track the quality of implants women receive and to make sure that when things go wrong with those implants, that can be acted on as quickly as possible - setting up a register will help us to do that." The Department of Health also said it was working with the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) to tackle "irresponsible marketing" such as buy-one-get-one-free deals and competitions for men to "win a boob-job" for their girlfriends. The ASA has already banned adverts from companies advertising "Boob jobs - more affordable than you may think" for "trivialising breast enhancement surgery". Dr Poulter said: "That sort of marketing is irresponsible because it can change the way a woman looks for the rest of their life and we need to see greater responsibility from the cosmetic industry in how they advertise themselves and we're going to clamp down." 'Early warning system' The Royal College of Surgeons will also create new qualifications and professional standards for cosmetic surgery. Rajiv Grover, consultant plastic surgeon and president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), said: "Whilst we're pleased there is to be a clampdown on time-linked incentives that place undue pressure on the public, we continue to call for an outright ban on all advertising of medical procedures. "People considering cosmetic surgery have a lot to think about: possible risks, their own expectations, the qualifications of the provider, recovery - whether there's a Christmas sale, a two-for-one if they book by Friday... should never play a part in a sensible decision-making process." Vicky Ashton, who had PIP implants and is part of a campaign group for those women affected, told BBC News changes in the industry were not coming "far enough fast enough". "What is taking the government so long and why on earth are they just piloting this scheme? It should have been rolled out months and months ago, and everybody should be forced to take part in it." She added: "My main concern is this is great going forward, but what about the women that are affected now - what [is the government] doing for them?" Mr Simon Withey, a consultant plastic surgeon and part of the panel which reviewed the industry, told the BBC: "The rhetoric is it's a cowboy industry. It's not. Most surgeons are excellent, but it doesn't take many poor ones to wreak havoc." He said a breast implant register was "exactly the right thing to do". "It acts as an early warning system of product failure which would have been helpful in PIP and it is now critical that if there are any product failures in the future that we can track patients as quickly as possible."
The club said it was reacting to "security intelligence", adding the restriction was in line with new checks on electronic equipment at airports. It said that unlike at airports, it would be "impractical" at the stadium to check the devices were genuine by asking for them to be powered up. Greater Manchester Police said it was not involved with the ban "in any way". A statement on the club's site says the ban extends to large and small tablets "including iPad minis", as well as larger electronic devices. Smartphones are still permitted as long as their dimensions are smaller than 15cm by 10cm (5.9in by 3.9in). "The regulations at each stadium are a matter for the relevant stadium management authorities, however, the scale of Old Trafford and profile of Manchester United mean that the risk at this venue is unique," it adds. A spokesman for the club told the BBC it had made the move after receiving "advice", but would not say from whom this had come. He added the action was unrelated to concerns about fans using tablets to record video of matches, potentially blocking the view of others, as had been reported elsewhere. A spokesman for the Premier League said: "This is not something we are responsible for or involved in." A spokesman for the Football Association was unable to provide comment. But Manchester United's rival Arsenal issued a statement: "Our ground regulations haven't changed. Our stadium management team are happy with our procedures." The government announced in July that passengers flying to the US or elsewhere who passed through UK airports needed to show that devices carried in their hand luggage were charged and could be powered on. The move followed a warning that US officials had become aware of a "credible" unnamed terrorist threat. The airport restrictions cover phones, MP3 players and cameras in addition to larger kit.
The four pictures show the princess being cradled by her elder sibling as they sit on a cream couch at Anmer Hall in Norfolk, their family home with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The pictures were taken by Catherine just weeks after Princess Charlotte was born on 2 May. In an earlier tweet, Kensington Palace said the images were "very special". In each of the pictures, Charlotte is lying on her brother's lap, wearing white. The prince is wearing a white shirt, blue shorts and blue socks. In one, he appears to be kissing his sister on the forehead. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children have been at Anmer Hall since leaving London shortly after the birth of the princess. Prince William and Catherine are expected to be based there for the next few years as they raise Princess Charlotte and Prince George, who is almost two, with the help of a full-time nanny. Photography is listed as one of the duchess's hobbies in her biography on the royal website. The pictures were taken on a Canon EOS 5D Mark II camera. The first official images of Prince George, released in 2013, were taken by the duchess's father, Michael Middleton, in the garden of their home in Bucklebury, Berkshire. Commentary: BBC Royal Correspondent Peter Hunt The photographs provide a rare glimpse of, as things stand, the future of the British monarchy. Such glimpses will remain reasonably rare as these royal children grow up. They'll next be captured together when Princess Charlotte is christened in July. In all of these four images the baby princess - just a few weeks old at the time the photos were taken by her mother - is in the arms of her brother, Prince George. As the toddler destined to be king continues to adjust to having a new addition to his family, his parents will hope the 22-month-old and the one-month-old will forge a bond as strong as the one enjoyed by Princes William and Harry. Harry has spoken of how they understand each other and give each other support. His older brother told someone recently that George was very lively and Charlotte had given her parents a "few sleepless nights". Read more from Peter on his correspondent page On Friday, it was announced Princess Charlotte will be christened on 5 July. The christening will take place at St Mary Magdalene Church at the Queen's Sandringham estate. Princess Charlotte was born on 2 May at London's St Mary's Hospital, weighing 8lbs 3oz (3.7kg). The fourth in line to the throne, her full name has been registered as Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge.
The drones, called Octocopters, could deliver packages weighing up to 2.3kg to customers within 30 minutes of them placing the order, he said. However, he added that it could take up to five years for the service to start. The US Federal Aviation Administration is yet to approve the use of unmanned drones for civilian purposes. "I know this looks like science fiction, but it's not," Mr Bezos told CBS television's 60 Minutes programme. "We can do half-hour delivery... and we can carry objects, we think, up to five pounds (2.3kg), which covers 86% of the items that we deliver." 'Ready to enter' The service will be called Prime Air and comes as Amazon is looking to improve its efficiency to boost growth. Amazon also posted a video on its website showing a drone picking up a package from one of its warehouses and delivering it to the doorstep of a customer's house. However, it still has to wait for permission from US regulators. The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved the use of drones for police and government agencies, issuing about 1,400 permits over the past several years. Civilian air space is expected to be opened up to all kinds of drones in the US by 2015 and in Europe by 2016. Existing regulations are in place to minimise the risk of injury to people on the ground, said Dr Darren Ansell, an expert on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) from the University of Central Lancashire. "The UAVs do not currently have the awareness of their environment to be able to avoid flying into people. To deliver goods to people's homes for example in residential areas, the UAVs must overfly densely populated towns and cities, something that today's regulations prevent. "Other things to consider are security of the goods during the transit. With no one to guard them the aircraft and package could be captured and stolen," he said. Amazon said: "from a technology point of view, we'll be ready to enter commercial operations as soon as the necessary regulations are in place." The FAA was "actively working on rules for unmanned aerial vehicles", the company said, adding that it hoped the green light would be given as early as 2015. "One day, Prime Air vehicles will be as normal as seeing mail trucks on the road today." Zookal, an Australian textbook rental company, announced earlier this year that it would start using drones to make deliveries from 2015 if approved by Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority. Australian law allows the use of unmanned aircraft for commercial use.
The controversial broadcaster will appear as the guest host of Have I Got News for You on 24 April. "Jeremy's contract has not been renewed on Top Gear but he isn't banned from appearing on the BBC," a BBC spokesman said. Clarkson has hosted the satirical news quiz on numerous occasions. During one appearance in 2008, he threw a pen at regular panellist Ian Hislop that left the latter with a cut on his face. Clarkson was suspended by the BBC on 10 March following a "fracas" with Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon in a hotel in North Yorkshire. Mr Tymon suffered swelling and a split lip in the assault on 4 March and visited a hospital A&E department for his injuries. Following an internal investigation, the BBC announced on 25 March Clarkson's contract on Top Gear would not be renewed. More than a million fans signed a petition to reinstate the presenter, but BBC director general Tony Hall said "a line has been crossed" and "there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another". On Tuesday, North Yorkshire Police said there was "no need for further action" against Clarkson following an inquiry into the "fracas". Top Gear is watched by some 350 million viewers worldwide and is one of the BBC's biggest properties - with overseas sales worth an estimated £50m a year. The BBC has said the show will continue without Clarkson, however it is unclear whether co-presenters James May and Richard Hammond will remain.
The show, described as a "festival of flame" honouring Britain's ancient traditions and festivals, brought 11 days of sport to a close. UK band Coldplay led the show, which started at 20:30 BST, with a live set reflecting the four seasons. The event ended what organisers say has been "the greatest Paralympic Games ever". Unlike the other Games ceremonies, the 4,200 athletes were seated around the main arena, putting them at the heart of the action. Declaring the 2012 Paralympics closed, International Paralympic Committee president, Sir Philip Craven, said: "These Games have changed us all forever." China finished top of the Paralympic medals table, with 231 medals - 95 gold. Great Britain cemented third place behind Russia, with a tally of 120, including 34 golds. As the ceremony drew to a close, Paralympians Ellie Simmonds and Jonnie Peacock helped to put out the Paralympic flame, which was shared out across the stadium symbolising "the eternal nature of the flame living among us all". Each participating country will take home one of the 200 copper petals that made up the Paralympic cauldron. In other developments on the final weekend of 2012: On Monday, 800 British stars of the Olympics and Paralympics will celebrate their success during a victory parade through the streets of London. Mayor of London Boris Johnson said he hoped to see a social and cultural legacy from the Games. 'Coming together' As Sunday's show began, a tribute was paid to the armed forces and military charity, Help for Heroes. GB Paralympians David Weir and Sarah Storey, who both won four gold medals at the Games, carried the British flag into the stadium, as flagbearers representing 164 nations participating in the Paralympics entered the arena. And Captain Luke Sinnott, who lost both legs in an IED bomb blast while serving in Afghanistan, climbed the flagpole to raise the Union Jack. Coldplay sang songs from their five albums, while dancers including the Candoco Dance Company - a contemporary group of 12 disabled and non-disabled dancers - performed with flames around the burning face of a "sun king". Apart from Coldplay's live set, the sold-out finale featured performances from pop star Rihanna, rapper Jay-Z and a cast of around 1,200 performers on three circular stages - Summer, Winter and the Sundial. "The idea is the coming together as one," said artistic director Kim Gavin behind the Festival of Flame. "We are known as a nation for having the most festivals, it is something that we do - with 600 festivals a year. "We pay tribute to all the human spirit and achievement through this wonderful sport of the last two weeks." Kenya's Mary Nakhumicha ZakayoIrish and Irish runner Michael McKillop were presented with gold medals in recognition of them winning the Whang Youn Dai Achievement Award - for athletes who exemplify the best spirit of the Paralympic Games. Flowers were also presented to honour the 70,000 Games Maker Olympic and Paralympic volunteers. Some 120 child volunteers from east London took part in the spectacle, along with disabled aerial performers from Circus Space and The British Paraorchestra. After the Paralympic flag was passed to the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro, Eduardo Paes, performers from Rio - which will stage the games in 2016 - put on a colourful performance fusing hip-hop freestyle and samba, performed by disabled and non-disabled dancers. Speaking to the 80,000-strong crowd, organising committee chairman Lord Coe said the UK would "never think of sport the same way and we will never think of disability the same way. "The Paralympians have lifted the cloud of limitation." He added: "Finally, there are some famous words you can find stamped on the bottom of a product. Words, that when you read them, you know mean high quality, mean skill, mean creativity. 'An absolute triumph' "We have stamped those words on the Olympic and Paralympic games of London 2012. "London 2012. Made in Britain." IPC president Sir Philip Craven said the Games had been "unique and without doubt, in my mind and those of the athletes - the greatest Paralympic Games ever". Speaking before the start of the ceremony, Prime Minister David Cameron said: "I think it's been an absolute triumph from start to finish and I'm really proud of the country, not just that we've put on a great show, but we've had these great audiences". Mr Cameron, whose disabled son Ivan died in 2009, added: "I think back to Ivan. As every parent, you think about all the things they can't do, but at the Paralympics they are superhuman, you see all the things they can do." He also said it would give momentum to sports participation and the Paralympics had changed perceptions of disabled sport.
By Stephen McDonellBBC News, Beijing If you get to see a press conference at this Congress, it's likely that reporters selected to ask a question have had it vetted by a government official who will coyly then say something like, "Oh, let's hope you get to ask that". However, it doesn't seem hard to find a Chinese journalist who, for example, on the one opportunity each year to face Foreign Minister Wang Yi doesn't want to know about Syria, North Korea, a potential trade war, the South China Sea and the like. What they do want to know is… People's Daily: "Thank you moderator, Foreign Minister, hello. Since the 18th Party Congress, China's diplomatic work has made unprecedented important achievements and has won unanimous praise from Chinese people. We know that 2018 was the first year after the 19th Party Congress. What have been the highlights of China's diplomacy this year? Can you tell us about it? Thank you." Foreign Minister Wang Yi: "Since the 18th Party Congress, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, we have indeed emerged on a road to great power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, Chinese style… " Here's another punchy offering from Beijing TV to the foreign minister: Beijing TV: "Hello, Foreign Minister. A few days ago, Premier Li Keqiang pointed out in his government work report that this year marks the beginning of the full implementation of the spirit of the 19th Party Congress. This is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up. It is a crucial year to realize a moderately prosperous society and the implementation of the 13th Five-Year Plan. You have repeatedly emphasized that serving the development of the country has always been the central task of China's diplomacy. I would like to know more about what measures the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will take this year. Thank you." Foreign Minister Wang Yi: "China is still a developing country and promoting domestic development is part great power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. In the face of a new historical mission… etc" In another press conference on the sidelines of the Congress, Zhang Huijun, a journalist from American Multimedia TV - which says it has a strong relationship with China Central Television - asked the chairman of the state-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission in her most perky and enthusiastic voice, "China has more and more state own assets abroad following the Belt and Road initiative. How can we protect them?" It was too much for a reporter from financial news service Yicai who, standing next to her, could be seen rolling her eyes at what a, well, sycophantic offering this was. The eye-rolling journalist, Liang Xiangyi, was seen on television and filmed on various people's phones. Her facial expressions are now going viral. Within hours people were dressing in red and blue, filming themselves imitating the two women. Liang Xiangyi's expressions have even been turned into a series of gifs, but posts on social media platforms using her name in Chinese are already being censored. You also have to wonder whether this reporter, who couldn't control her natural reaction, might now be punished. In other countries this might be just funny. Not here. This is exactly the type of meltdown the Communist Party doesn't want to have because it shows what a farce the Congress press conferences can be. Many will say it's the Party's own fault for stacking these events with ever more gushing questioners who even sound hilarious to Chinese ears which have taken in this stuff for decades. And, if things can spin out of control with the local media, imagine the concern when foreign correspondents are getting involved. Sometimes a government official, perhaps from the Foreign Ministry, will contact major international news organisations and ask them if they would like to "have a question" at a news conference. Readers might wonder why Communist Party officials bother with all the hassle of tying to manage an unpredictable foreign press corps. Why not just stop us all going in and let the local press - under Party control - ask the desired questions? The answer: because they want us there. They want the foreign media in the room to show a domestic audience how internationally significant the National People's Congress is. All the Congress media events are controlled to some extent but none more so than the premier's which takes place on the last day. As foreign correspondents arrive some are urged to sit down the front, although they have no hope whatsoever of being called on. This is so that Chinese television can show their faces, show their hands up, show them taking down on their notepads the profound offerings of China's leadership. At the beginning of this Congress, Chris Buckley from the New York Times took to Twitter to urge his fellow correspondents not allow themselves to be used as tools of propaganda. He posted on Twitter: "My prayer for this NPC: Please reporters stop the game of negotiating to ask tame questions... a charade of accountability will do nobody any good and does us discredit." To participate or not? The extent to which we should participate is the subject of considerable debate amongst foreign correspondents based here. Some argue we should not attend at all and just report events from afar. Others say it's worth submitting questions and asking them in order to try and make the best out of a deeply flawed situation. The BBC, for example, has decided not submit questions for screening. This means we don't get called on. In other countries reporters would just shout out the questions anyway and perhaps that is what we should all consider doing. On the other hand, if you would like to know how Chinese officials would prefer to see the Congress covered then here is a little taste . The article below is about the constitutional change paving the way for President Xi Jinping - and all other future presidents - to remain in power beyond a two-term limit, potentially for as long as they desire. There has been no national debate about this enormous change to the way 1.5 billion people are to be ruled. It has been barely mentioned in state media. See if you can find a meaningful reference to it in an article from the Party's official Xinhua newswire. The NPC finishes on 20 March, with an even more empowered President Xi Jinping "as the core". Keep an eye out for the final press conference with Premier Li Keqiang. It is possible that not a single reporter will be able ask why it has been so necessary to dispense with two-term presidential limits (one of this country's only checks on power introduced to prevent the emergence of another Chairman Mao) so as to allow Xi Jinping to rule China for the rest of his life. One of the most significant changes to the way China is ruled in decades, at this Congress, and potentially not one decent question to the premier about it? We'll see. Let's hope there is one.
The announcement follows unconfirmed reports that Pyongyang's top diplomat in Italy had sought asylum from an unidentified Western country. Jo Song-gil, the acting North Korean ambassador to Rome, is the son and son-in-law of high-ranking North Korean officials. The last senior diplomat to defect was the deputy ambassador in London. Thae Yong-ho abandoned his post in 2016, along with his wife and children. He defected to South Korea. As one of the highest-ranking officials to ever defect from the North, his move was seen as a blow to Kim Jong-un's regime. He would go on to urge the world to spread information in North Korea to undermine Mr Kim's status among his people. Speaking after a briefing from the spy agency on Thursday, Kim Min-ki, a government MP, told reporters that Mr Jo fled the Rome embassy more than a month ago. "Acting ambassador Jo Song-gil's term was ending in late November last year and he escaped the diplomatic compound in early November," the MP said. South Korean's National Intelligence Service, which interrogates all defectors from the North, told lawmakers they had not had any contact from him since then. The agency would not confirm that he is trying to defect to another country. Mr Jo's wife is believed to be with him. Italy's foreign ministry has told the BBC that it has no record of an asylum request made by Mr Jo. Diplomatic sources said the last Italy heard of him was when officials received a note last year from the North Korean government saying that Mr Jo was being replaced. South Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo has reported that Mr Jo is in a "safe place" with his family, citing a diplomatic source. Where is Jo Song-gil? Analysis by the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul High-profile defections by one of North Korea's elite are rare and would be a huge embarrassment for leader Kim Jong-un. State media has often insisted that any defections by diplomats are part of a plot by South Korea or the United States to undermine its government. Pyongyang considers them traitors to the country and its people, and defectors say there can be severe consequences for any family members left behind. The last senior diplomat to defect, Thae Yong-ho, once said that he made his decision as he wanted to give his two sons an education outside the impoverished state. He has told reporters in South Korea that he worked with Jo Song-gil. He claimed that Mr Jo was responsible for delivering luxury goods to North Korea via an Italian company and that he may know more about Pyongyang's nuclear plans. This is the kind of information US intelligence services would be keen to get their hands on. But where is the 48-year-old envoy? Has he asked for asylum? It is unlikely any country will confirm Jo Song-gil's whereabouts until it is clear he and his family are safe. What do we know about Mr Jo? Mr Jo, 48, has been acting ambassador in Rome since October 2017 after Italy expelled then-ambassador Mun Jong-nam in protest over a North Korean nuclear test a month earlier. North Korea's embassy in Italy manages relations with the UN's Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization, which provides important aid to the country. North Korean diplomats stationed abroad usually have to leave several family members behind in Pyongyang to prevent their defection. But Mr Jo is thought to have been in Rome with his wife and children, privileges that suggest his family is influential. Both his father and father-in-law were diplomats. His father-in-law Lee Do-seop was a well-known ambassador to Thailand and Hong Kong, according to Thae Yong-ho. How unusual is this? North Korean representatives overseas are said to be closely watched by their fellow diplomats for any sign of disloyalty to the regime. However several have defected over the past few decades. They include Ko Yong-hwan and Hyon Song-il, who defected to the South in 1991 and 1996 respectively after abandoning their posts in Africa. Jang Sung-gil, a former ambassador to Egypt, took asylum in the US in 1997 with his family, including a brother who was a diplomat working in London. The disappearance of Jo Song-gil comes after a year that saw a dramatic turnaround in relations between North and South Korea, with three meetings held between the countries' leaders. But if Mr Jo has indeed defected, it will not impact inter-Korean relations, "unless Pyongyang thinks the escape was arranged by South Korean authorities", Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul, told the AFP news agency.
The 49-year-old Colorado native, whose legal pedigree includes Harvard and Oxford, would succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia if confirmed. He is favoured by many conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law as Scalia. Judge Gorsuch was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006. Inexhaustible Churchill quotes Judge Gorsuch began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, the latter of whom he could now serve alongside. He worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration. Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University. Perhaps it was during his time in England that he accumulated what his former law partner, Mark Hansen, has said was "an inexhaustible store" of Winston Churchill quotes. Judge Gorsuch - who reportedly likes to fly-fish and hunt - lives in Boulder with his wife Louise and two daughters, where he is also an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado. If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the only Protestant on the current bench. The other justices are Jewish and Catholic. His family is well-connected in Republican establishment politics. His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was the first female director of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Reagan administration. A writer's flair He is known for his clear and concise writing style, navigating the most complex legal issues as deftly as the double-black diamond slopes on which he is reputedly an expert skier in the snow-capped mountain state he calls home. Judge Gorsuch's published writings reveal his conservative leanings. He argued against euthanasia in his 2006 book The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia. "All human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong," he wrote. In a 2005 article in the National Review, Judge Gorsuch argued that "American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom". He said they keep "relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda". Solidly conservative rulings Judge Gorsuch has never ruled on abortion, and he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on that issue or gay marriage. His conservative outlook cements Mr Trump's campaign promise to nominate a judge "in the mould" of Justice Scalia, restoring the nine-seat high court's 5-4 conservative majority. Much like the late Scalia, the Ivy-League educated judge is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. While sitting on the bench of the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch sided with groups that successfully challenged the Obama administration's requirements for employers to provide health insurance that includes contraception in the Hobby Lobby Stores v Sebelius case. Judge Gorsuch has also expressed concern about "executive overreach", a criticism that was often directed at the Obama administration's use of presidential orders to overcome congressional gridlock. He has sharply questioned a landmark Supreme Court ruling determining that courts should defer to government agencies when it comes to interpretations of ambiguous federal laws. Conservatives blame the 1984 decision involving the Chevron oil company for handing too much power to the regulatory state. In an August 2016 concurring opinion, Judge Gorsuch wrote that "executive bureaucracies [were being allowed] to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design". In a 2013 case, he upheld a lower court's ruling that a police officer was protected under qualified-immunity law after he used a stun gun on a 22-year-old student, who died from the incident.
The Home Affairs Select Committee said much low-level internet-based financial crime was falling into a "black hole" and was not reported to the police. The MPs said more officers should be trained in digital crime detection and e-crime experts protected from cuts. The Home Office said the authorities must "keep pace" with criminals. Publishing its first report on the subject, the cross-party committee said e-crime took various forms, did not recognise national borders and could be committed "at almost any time or in any place". 'Off the hook' It called for a dedicated cyber-espionage team to respond to attacks, many of which are believed to be backed by foreign governments because they are so sophisticated. Offences range from attacks on computer networks and the use of viruses to steal data to the use of cyberspace to facilitate traditional crimes such as forgery, sabotage, drug smuggling and people trafficking. The committee said it was worried by the evidence it had heard during its inquiry about the UK's e-crime fighting capability. It said it had been told by Adrian Leppard, deputy assistant commissioner at the City of London Police, that up to a quarter of the UK's 800 specialist internet crime officers could be lost due to budget cuts. This was despite evidence the UK was a prime target for many of the 1,300 criminal gangs specialising in fraud. A quarter of the gangs, many of which are based in eastern Europe and Russia, use the internet as their principal means of deception. The MPs said police cutbacks came on top of proposed 10% cuts to the budget of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre. "At a time when fraud and e-crime is going up, the capability of the country to address it is going down," the report concluded. "Ministers have acknowledged the increasing threat of e-crime but it is clear that sufficient funding and resources have not been allocated to the law enforcement responsible for tackling it." As well as calling for a cyber-espionage team, the report's recommendations include: Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said the UK's response to e-crime was too "fractured". He told BBC 5 live: "Our country is the number one target for gangs in 25 countries." He added: "It's much easier and more lucrative to steal on the internet than it is to go out and rob a bank. "These are real e-wars. At the moment we are not winning the e-wars." Mr Vaz said the gangs committing e-crimes were "predominantly" from eastern Europe, including European Union countries such as Romania. The UK's eavesdropping centre GCHQ suggested earlier this year that 80% of cyber-attacks could be prevented by better management of information online. The Police Federation of England and Wales said the MPs' report was further evidence that recent figures showing a 10% fall in recorded crime last year were "misleading". Javed Khan, chief executive of the charity Victim Support, called the findings "worrying", adding: "E-criminals cannot be allowed to get ahead of our police and their partners." And Matthew Fell, of the CBI business group, questioned the need to "force businesses to report a cyber attack as soon as it happens", adding that the they "should instead be focusing on fighting the attack privately". He said reporting could even prove "counterproductive" and put firms "at greater risk". The government announced increased funding for cyber-security in 2010, while a single National Cybercrime Unit will be formed later this year as part of the new National Crime Agency. Deputy Chief Constable Peter Goodman, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police officers on e-crime, said the new unit would bring a "real step change in our response to e-crime". A Home Office spokesman said: "Crime is at record low levels and this government is taking action to tackle the cyber-threat, investing more than £850m through the national cyber-security programme to develop and maintain cutting-edge capabilities." He said the new cybercrime unit would "target the most serious offenders and provide enhanced intelligence for Ceop so they can protect even more children from harm". "But we know we need to keep pace with criminals as they target the web and so we continue to consider ways to ensure the police and security services have access to communications data," the spokesman added.
The man being assaulted has special needs, police say. His assailants can be heard making derogatory statements against white people and President-elect Donald Trump. In one part of the video they use a knife to remove part of his scalp. Chicago police have described the video as a "sickening" possible hate crime. The assault went on for two days, until the man was found disorientated, walking the streets. "It makes you wonder what would make individuals treat somebody like that," said Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson. "I've been a cop for 28 years, and I've seen things that you shouldn't see in a lifetime, but it still amazes me how you still see things that you just shouldn't." What did the video show? The incident happened in a flat on Chicago's West Side. In the 30-minute video, the attackers can be seen cutting the 18-year-old victim's clothes, dropping cigarette ash on him, pushing his head back with a foot and drawing blood by cutting off some of his hair with a knife. Several people can be seen drinking, laughing and smoking, while their bound and gagged captive cowered in the corner of the room. In other videos posted online the young man is beaten, made to drink from a toilet bowl and forced at knife-point to say "I love black people". An African-American woman talks to the camera, sometimes with slurred speech. At least two male African-Americans are also visible in the footage. How did police find them? The unnamed white victim is a school acquaintance of one of the attackers. Police say they found him on Monday wandering in the streets in a disorientated and distressed state after the assault. Later they say they responded to reports of an assault close to where he was discovered and uncovered evidence of violence and damage to property. They described him as facing "mental health challenges". They believe he may have been kidnapped for up to 48 hours prior to the assault. He was taken to hospital, traumatised by the attack, and had difficulty communicating with police, but was later released from hospital. Who has been arrested and have they been charged? Police say four people, two male and two female, aged 18, have been arrested. Three were Chicago residents, they said. On Thursday, a police spokesman said the four black suspects made "terrible racist statements" during the assault. But he said police think the victim was attacked because he has "special needs", not because he is white. Police also said there was a possibility that the incident would be considered a kidnapping. How violent is Chicago? BBC North America correspondent James Cook says the incident is shocking, but gangland violence is far from uncommon in Chicago. It recorded 762 murders last year, more than in the larger cities of New York and Los Angeles combined. In speeches and tweets, President-elect Donald Trump has made much of the crime and racial division in the city where President Barack Obama worked as an activist and a senator. The incoming president now faces the much tougher challenge of turning damning words into useful actions. What has been the reaction? The incident has provoked a strong reaction on Twitter, especially among alt-right - the fringe group that celebrated Mr Trump's election win with Nazi salutes. They say the mainstream media has been slower to react, and the police slower to label it a hate crime, than if a black person had been assaulted by white people. The hashtag #BLMKidnapping was adopted by users suggesting the Black Lives Matter campaign was in some way involved, although police have not mentioned the organisation in connection with the incident. Some people, however, used the hashtag to dismiss the suggestion as completely unfounded. It was trending worldwide and in the US, with more than 280,000 posts in 12 hours. Torture video prompts online race fight What does Facebook say? The video was streamed on Facebook Live for 30 minutes, but the company later removed it. A spokesman told Associated Press the social media giant does "not allow people to celebrate or glorify crimes on Facebook". Some versions of the video have also been removed from YouTube, after users reposted it. Facebook detailed its policy on live-streaming in July 2016, after the filming of the aftermath of an incident in which a police officer shot a black man dead in St Paul, Minnesota. The company says its rules for live video are the same as for other content. Footage will not be removed simply because it is violent or graphic, but if it is shared to mock the victim or celebrate the violence it will be taken down. Live videos can be reported to a team which is on call 24 hours a day. Reviewers in the team can interrupt a live stream if it breaches Facebook's community standards. In June, Chicago man Antonio Perkins, 28, was shot dead while live-streaming a video of himself on Facebook.
Indian-born Mr Nadella is currently Microsoft's head of Cloud and Enterprise, which builds and runs the firm's computing platforms and developer tools. He takes over from Steve Ballmer who announced plans to step down last year. Company founder Bill Gates said there was "no better person to lead Microsoft". Mr Gates is stepping down as chairman, it was also announced, but will take up a new role as a technology adviser and will also retain a seat on Microsoft's board. Microsoft's lead independent director John Thompson will take over as chairman. 'Proven leader' "Microsoft is one of those rare companies to have truly revolutionised the world through technology, and I couldn't be more honoured to have been chosen to lead the company," said Mr Nadella. "The opportunity ahead for Microsoft is vast, but to seize it, we must focus clearly, move faster and continue to transform. A big part of my job is to accelerate our ability to bring innovative products to our customers more quickly." Mr Nadella, 46, is Microsoft's third chief executive. The Hyderabad-born executive joined the company in 1992 and has degrees in electronics, computer science and business administration. He previously led its server and tools business before being put in charge of the unit that built Microsoft's Cloud OS service, which powers products such as Bing, Skype and Xbox Live. "During this time of transformation, there is no better person to lead Microsoft than Satya Nadella," said Mr Gates. "Satya is a proven leader with hard-core engineering skills, business vision and the ability to bring people together. His vision for how technology will be used and experienced around the world is exactly what Microsoft needs as the company enters its next chapter of expanded product innovation and growth." Mr Gates' appointment as a technology adviser is seen as significant, suggesting he may again take a more hands-on role in the company he founded nearly 40 years ago. In a video statement, he said the job would mean "substantially increasing the time that I spend at the company", working with product development teams. Experience concerns Mr Nadella's appointment ends months of speculation over who would succeed Mr Ballmer, who announced his intention to stand down in August last year. At one stage incoming chairman John Thompson said more than 100 possible candidates had been identified. Rumoured to be among them were the boss of car giant Ford, Alan Mulally, and Nokia chief executive Stephen Elop. Investors have been calling for new leadership at the Microsoft, saying it needs a significant shakeup in order to become more innovative and profitable. Some analysts suggest Mr Nadella's background in cloud computing - a growth area for Microsoft - will be advantageous. "Satya was really one of the people who helped build up the commercial muscle,'' said Kirk Materne, an analyst with Evercore Partners. "He has a great understanding of what's going on in the cloud and the importance of delivering more technology as a service." But some critics have questioned whether Mr Nadella is the right man for the job. He has no experience of running a company, let alone one as big as Microsoft. There are also concerns that Mr Gates and Mr Ballmer will continue to exert influence over the direction of the company. "We do not want to see a continuation of the existing direction for the business, so it will be important that Mr Nadella be free to make changes,'' said Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund. Microsoft shares, having risen 1% in early trading, closed down 0.4%.
By Andreas IllmerBBC News But what if a flag is so offensive to some countries it sparks a whole movement to get it banned? That is what's happening with Japan's rising sun flag and the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. And the strongest criticism is from South Korea - where some politicians even compare it to the Nazi swastika. Critics say the flag is flown by fans who want to romanticise and rewrite the human rights abuses by Japanese forces. South Korea wants it banned at the games - but the 2020 organisers say the flag is "widely used in Japan" and is "not a political statement". What is the rising sun flag? Japan's national flag is simply a red disc on a white background - and no-one has a problem with that one. The rising sun flag has a similar red disc but with 16 red rays coming from it. Both flags have in fact been used for a long time, dating back centuries. During the 19th Century, the rising sun symbol became the flag of the military. As such, it was flying during Japan's imperialist expansion when it occupied Korea and part of China. During World War Two, it became the flag of the navy - and that's largely where it got its controversial reputation. Japanese troops occupied much of Asia during the war, carrying out atrocities against local people. Today, it's still the flag of the country's navy and a slightly different version is used for the regular military. Why is South Korea unhappy with it? In 1905, Japan occupied Korea as a protectorate, and five years later as a full-fledged colony. The Japanese rule was one of economic exploitation and hundreds of thousands of Koreans were pressed into forced labour to aid the Japanese expansion in other parts of Asia. The brutal regime also saw thousands of girls and young women forced to work in military brothels set up for Japanese soldiers before and during World War Two. Known euphemistically as "comfort women", they were forced into sexual slavery. Aside from Korean victims, the Japanese army also forced girls from Taiwan, China and the Philippines into the brothels. Many South Koreans associate the rising sun flag with a long list of war crimes and oppression - and see Japan's continued use of the symbol as emblematic of Tokyo's failure to address its past. The flag is "one thread in a tapestry of other South Korean complaints regarding Japan's perceived inability - or unwillingness - to accept responsibility for colonial transgressions," explains Korea analyst Ellen Swicord. South Korea's foreign ministry has described the flag as a symbol of Japanese "imperialism and militarism". Meanwhile, a parliamentary committee for sports said it was "akin to a symbol of the devil to Asians and Koreans, just like the swastika is a symbol of Nazis which reminds European of invasion of horror". Why no protest from China? Based on a historical experience of Japanese invasion, China's reaction to the rising sun flag at the Olympics could be similar to South Korea's. After the Japanese military took the Chinese city of Nanjing in 1937, Japanese troops embarked on a months-long campaign of murder, rape and looting in what became one of the worst massacres of the war. According to Chinese estimates, around 300,000 people were killed, many of them women and children, and around 20,000 women raped. Yet there's little protest from China about the flag. The reason is simple politics, explains Prof David Arase, from the Nanjing campus of Johns Hopkins University. Chinese media is state-controlled and Beijing is currently working to improve ties with Tokyo. In fact, Chinese President Xi Jinping is planning to visit Japan in the spring to meet the new Japanese emperor. "That means China does not make a big issue out of it, and hence people wouldn't be primed for any outrage over that flag," Mr Arase says. Is it comparable to the swastika? There are arguments for and against. The rising sun flag has been used as a traditional national symbol of Japan for centuries, and appears in advertisements and on commercial products. In Germany, the swastika was only used when the Nazis were in power. It is now banned in Germany, and the Nazi symbol is only used by extremist groups. Yet even though the rising sun flag has a longer history, "no-one in Japan uses the rising sun flag for any purpose other than romanticising and rewriting the horrible human rights abuses committed under the Japanese empire," argues Koichi Nakano, professor of political science at Sophia University in Tokyo. He suggests a better comparison than the swastika is the Confederate flag in the US. That flag was used in the American civil war by southern states that wanted to keep slavery. The flag is not banned, and is still flown across southern states, but critics say it is a symbol of racial segregation - and perceived superiority. Why won't Japan ban the flag? Despite pressure from South Korea, there has been no concession from Japan so far. There is even an explanation by the foreign ministry, which looks at the overall history of the flag without any references to its role during World War Two. "The design of the rising sun flag is widely used throughout Japan, such as 'good catch' flags used by fishermen, celebratory flags for childbirth and seasonal festivities, and flags of Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels. "Claims that the flag is an expression of political assertions or a symbol of militarism are absolutely false." In fact, even Japan's liberal newspaper Asahi Shimbun has a version of the flag as its logo. Is this a political move? Japan's reluctance comes at a time where relations between South Korea and Japan are at a new low. Over the summer, a diplomatic feud over wartime labour compensation snowballed into a full-blown trade row between the two sides. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's refusal to act is seen by some as an attempt to please an ultra-conservative faction. "The current Japanese government is letting extreme nationalism to carry on and is tacitly supporting its expression," explains Harrison Kim, assistant professor in history at the University of Hawaii. Yet Japan's alleged inability to properly deal with its brutal imperial past "is not the fault of the Japan alone", he says. Rather, it's in part because the US sought to secure Tokyo as an ally during the Cold War. "The Japanese government did not have to resort to reparations and redress that would appropriately deal with its own past," says Mr Kim. The result, he argues, is that Japan has not implemented a permanent way of "memorialising and apologising for its imperial crimes - not in law, not in education, and not in culture".
By Nick HopkinsInvestigations correspondent, BBC Newsnight The secret initiative, put forward two years ago, was the brainchild of the then most senior UK military officer, General Sir David Richards. It was considered by the PM and the National Security Council, as well as US officials, but was deemed too risky. The UK government did not respond to a request for comment. Lord Richards, as he is now, believed his proposal could stem the civilian bloodshed in Syria as rebels fought troops loyal to Mr Assad. The idea was considered by David Cameron and Dominic Grieve, the attorney general, and sent to the National Security Council, Whitehall sources said. It was also put to senior figures in Washington, including General Martin Dempsey, the US's most senior military officer. While it was thought to be too radical at the time, US President Barack Obama said last week he was seeking $500m (£291m) funding to train Syrian rebels - an echo of Lord Richards' plan. Insiders have told BBC Newsnight that Lord Richards, then chief of the defence staff but since retired from the military, warned Downing Street there were only two ways to end the Syrian civil war quickly - to let President Assad win, or to defeat him. 'Extract, equip, train' With ministers having pledged not to commit British "boots on the ground", his initiative proposed vetting and training a substantial army of moderate Syrian rebels at bases in Turkey and Jordan. Mr Cameron was told the "extract, equip, train" plan would involve an international coalition. It would take a year, but this would buy time for an alternative Syrian government to be formed in exile, the PM was told. Once the Syrian force was ready, it would march on Damascus, with the cover of fighter jets from the West and Gulf allies. The plan envisaged a "shock and awe" campaign, similar to the one that routed Saddam's military in 2003, but spearheaded by Syrians. Opportunity 'missed' Though the plan was put to one side at the time, Mr Cameron was later persuaded to consider military action when evidence emerged of chemical weapons use in Syria. However, MPs voted against giving authority for a direct intervention last August. The US and UK accused the Assad government of being behind the attacks, but Damascus blamed rebel groups. Monzer Akbik, spokesman for the Syrian National Coalition, an opposition alliance, said: "The international community did not intervene to prevent those crimes and at the same time did not actively support the moderate elements on the ground. "A huge opportunity was missed and that opportunity could have saved tens of thousands of lives actually and could have saved also a huge humanitarian catastrophe." 'No good options' Professor Michael Clarke, of the Royal United Services Institute think tank, added: "We have missed the opportunity to train an anti-Assad force that would have real influence in Syria when he is removed, as he will be. "I think there was an opportunity two or three years ago to have become involved in a reasonably positive way, but it was dangerous and swimming against the broader tide of history… and the costs and the uncertainties were very high." He said it was now too late for the West to get involved. "Western policymakers in a sense have got to have the courage to do nothing and to work on what comes after the civil war," he said. "There are no good options over Syria. It is a slow-motion road accident." Tens of thousands of people have died and millions more have been displaced in three years of civil war in Syria.
The unemployment rate now stands at 7.2%, but the Office for National Statistics said the improvement in the labour market could be slowing. Meanwhile, more women are in work than at any time since records began, at just over 14 million. Average earnings have also increased, by 1.1% in the year to December. Latest estimates show that 193,000 more people were in work between October and December, compared to the previous three months. That means overall employment now stands at more than 30 million, a rate of 72.1%, which is an increase of 0.6% on a year ago. Rate fall "slowing" The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance fell by 27,600 in January to 1.22 million, its 15th consecutive monthly drop. ONS figures released last month put the unemployment rate at 7.1%, slightly less than this month's estimate of 7.2%. However, the ONS insists the latest statistics show a fall in the unemployment rate, because the most meaningful comparisons are made quarterly in order not to rely too much on a single month's figure. On that basis, the rate of unemployment in the three months to December fell by 0.4% on the previous quarter, when it stood at 7.6%. Nick Palmer, the ONS's senior labour market statistician, said: "The main conclusion that should be drawn from these latest figures is that the rate at which unemployment has been falling is likely to have slowed down." Youth unemployment Youth and long-term unemployment have also fallen, but there has been little change in the number of people classed as economically inactive, which has remained just under nine million. Employment Minister Esther McVey said the figures were more evidence the government's economic plans were working. "Record numbers of women are in work and youth unemployment continues to fall, which means more people have the security of a regular wage and can plan for their future," she added. However, Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Rachel Reeves said jobless levels were still too high. "While today's fall in overall unemployment is welcome, the government must not be complacent," she added. "More than 900,000 young people are still unemployed and over 250,000 young people have been unemployed for over a year." The number of people in part-time jobs now stands at 1.4 million, a fall of 29,000 over the latest quarter, but 46,000 higher than a year ago. Bank of England According to the ONS figures, the number of self-employed workers increased by 172,000 to 4.37 million. The unemployment rate remains a key focus for the Bank of England, but it is no longer linked to governor Mark Carney's pledge to keep interest rates at record lows. The Bank had pledged not to consider a rate rise until unemployment fell to 7%, but with that target set to be reached much earlier than expected, the guidance has been replaced. Policy will now be determined not just by unemployment, but by a wider range of indicators, including wage growth and productivity. Mr Carney also warned the recovery was not secure and that when rates rose, they would do so only "gradually". Analysts say that despite the latest jobs estimates being less buoyant than in previous months, they could hint at some more positive signs for the UK economy, bearing in mind recent increases in economic growth. Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "It could be an early sign that productivity is finally starting to pick up with more companies making increasing use of their existing workers rather than taking on new workers. "This would be highly welcome news for the economy's longer-term growth prospects."
Led by the Queen, who arrived in a Bentley, the royals made their way from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church for the traditional service. The other members of the family made the short journey on foot. Hundreds of well-wishers had gathered in the rain to catch a glimpse of the monarch and other senior members of the Royal Family. The Queen, who arrived in Norfolk by train last week, wore a red coat and hat with fur trim, and held a matching umbrella. She returned to Sandringham House by car after the service, but Prince Harry was among those who stopped to speak to members of the public. At the scene BBC reporter Emilia Papadopoulos The cold weather and rain didn't stop the crowds from turning up at Sandringham. Almost 1,000 well-wishers from as far away as Canada, the United States and China queued for hours to catch a glimpse of the Royal Family. There were loud cheers as the Queen arrived at church in her Bentley and bright red coat. The rest of the family walked up the path from the house, led by the Duke Of Edinburgh and Princess Anne. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge followed without Prince George and Princess Charlotte - much to the disappointment of the crowds. After the service the Queen was driven away while the younger royals, including Prince Harry, greeted the public and collected flowers. Many of the young children in the crowd told us that the prince had wished them a Merry Christmas - and made their day. The royals then headed back down the path for Christmas lunch just before the heavy rain began. This afternoon they will go for a walk on the estate and watch the Queen's Speech together. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall were also among those to attend the service. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled to the estate from their home at nearby Anmer Hall. Prince George and Princess Charlotte did not accompany their parents to church. The service was played over speakers for members of the public who gathered outside the church for the occasion. It began with the national anthem, followed by the hymn Angels From the Realm of Glory. The Royal Family are expected to watch the Queen's Christmas Day address later. They follow the German tradition of exchanging presents on Christmas Eve, rather than Christmas Day - with the Queen understood to favour practical gifts.
The singer told The Sun he had performed 10 concerts in "agony" on his European tour before he called in doctors. "I was a ticking time bomb. I guess I could have died at any time," he said. According to his website, he is on a course of "intensive antibiotics" and is expected to undergo surgery "in the coming weeks". Sir Elton has had to postpone a series of summer festival dates including shows in Italy, Germany and London's Hyde Park this week. A spokesman said the diagnosis had been made "following a number of exploratory scans and blood tests with his medical team in the UK". He confirmed the singer would not return to touring until he had fully recovered from both the planned surgery and any damage caused by the appendix abscess. "Elton is incredibly disappointed to postpone these tour dates," he said. "To know that he made such super-human efforts and continued to perform to thousands through his illness only confirms his dedication to his European fans. "He is eager to be back on top form and return to play the remaining shows starting in early September 2013." Sir Elton had been due to perform at the Collisioni festival in Italy on Tuesday, with further shows in Germany on Thursday and a headline gig at London's Hyde Park on Friday. British Summer Time festival organisers AEG Live said the Hyde Park show would still go ahead with Elvis Costello and former Kinks frontman Ray Davies on the bill, with existing ticket holders receiving a full refund. Other July dates now scrapped include festivals in Spain, France and Monaco. Sir Elton is due back in the UK in September, performing at the First Direct Arena in Leeds and at Bestival before heading back to Las Vegas for a month-long residency at The Colosseum.
Under current regulations, Twitter cannot reveal certain information about government requests for users' data relating to national security. Twitter argues that this violates the right to free speech, as defined by the First Amendment to the US Constitution. The firm said it brought the case in an effort to force the government to be more transparent about personal data requests. "It's our belief that we are entitled under the First Amendment to respond to our users' concerns and to the statements of US government officials by providing information about the scope of US government surveillance," Twitter's lawyer, Ben Lee, wrote in a blog post. Twitter brought the action against the US Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a northern California court on Tuesday. In April, Twitter submitted a Transparency Report to the US government for publication; however, so far officials have denied the firm's request to share the full report with the public. That report includes specific information about the nature and number of requests for Twitter user information relating to national security. "The US government engages in extensive but incomplete speech about the scope of its national security surveillance activities as they pertain to US communications providers, while at the same time prohibiting service providers such as Twitter from providing their own informed perspective as potential recipients of various national security-related requests," wrote Twitter. 'Obligation to protect' Although Twitter receives significantly fewer government requests than rival technology firms such as Google, the American Civil Liberties Union said the suit might spur others to act. "We hope that other technology companies will now follow Twitter's lead," said Jameel Jaffer, American Civil Liberties Union deputy legal director, in a statement. "Technology companies have an obligation to protect their customers' sensitive information against overbroad government surveillance, and to be candid with their customers about how their information is being used and shared." Several of the largest US tech firms have been fighting government requests for their users' private data, including Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Dropbox. Others, such as Apple, have taken steps to circumvent US government requests by encrypting user data in a manner that puts it beyond the reach of law enforcement.
By Will GrantBBC News, Santa Clara Among crowds at his statue and mausoleum was his old friend, Cuban President Raúl Castro. Many more watched at home on state TV as President Castro laid a white rose on Guevara's tomb. The revolutionary still divides opinion as much today as he did in life. For five decades his name has adorned every corner of Cuba, from banknotes to billboards, his image one of the most recognisable in Latin America. The people who turned out in Santa Clara - the city synonymous with his greatest victory in battle - clad in Che T-shirts or holding up his image in pictures, think of him as nothing less than a hero. They came to celebrate the charismatic, uncompromising Argentine they adopted as one of their own. "We hold him very close, we have him near us always. We know what Che represents to Cubans, to Latin Americans and to the world. For us it's a great honour to have his image on our chests and in our hearts," said one man. An excerpt of Fidel Castro's speech in 1967 announcing the death of Che Guevara to the Cuban people was played in which he famously urged Cuban children "to be like Che", a slogan that endures today. Judging from the number of schoolchildren in the audience, Guevara's life will remain a crucial part of the education of young people in Cuba for decades to come. His supporters see him as an example of commitment and self-sacrifice, his critics see a man they consider brutal and cruel. But whether he's considered a fearless hero or a bloodthirsty radical, one thing is sure - he was part of a generation that is coming to the end of its time in Cuba. Fidel Castro died last year and most of Guevara's comrades who turned out for this event are in their 80s. President Raúl Castro is due to stand down next year, a moment that will see someone other than a member of the Castro family at the helm in Cuba for the first time in almost 60 years.
Home Secretary Priti Patel said the UK was still at "a high level of threat" and an attack could "occur without further warning". The terrorism threat is now at its lowest since August 2014. Substantial is the third of five ratings at which the threat level can stand. The separate terrorism threat level for Northern Ireland remains "severe". Ms Patel said in a statement on Monday that terrorism remained a "direct and immediate" risk to the UK's national security. Assessments determining the country's threat level are taken by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) - part of MI5 - which makes its recommendations independently from the government. "Government, police and intelligence agencies will continue to work tirelessly to address the threat posed by terrorism in all its forms," Ms Patel said. The threat level is kept under "constant review", she added. Neil Basu, head of counter terrorism policing, said there had been "positive developments" in the fight against terrorism but it was "vital that we all maintain a high level of vigilance". He said the UK's counter terrorism policing team had about 800 live counter terrorism investigations - while 24 attack plots had been thwarted since the Westminster attack in March 2017. This is a significant change in the only official public measure of the threat posed by terrorism to the UK - but it's not a sign that there are suddenly fewer people with aspirations to do us harm. The security services are still monitoring thousands of "subjects of interest" - the top-tier of would-be plotters from jihadist groups to the far-right. Many of these people are very dangerous because, in the jargon, they are "lone actors" bent on DIY violence. But what appears to have changed is the resources and capability available to IS-supporting plotters who need help. Quite simply, a huge number of the foreign fighters who played a key role linking these followers to resources and support died on the battlefields of the militant group's last stand. Continuing propaganda from the survivors, portraying IS as a force to be reckoned with, also has less credibility for would-be recruits. And so it has become harder - for now at least - for some of those with intent to get the help they need to carry out their aspirations. The UK's terrorism threat level was raised to the highest rating, "critical", in the days following the Manchester Arena bombing in May 2017. It last reached this level again briefly in September that year, after a bomb partially exploded on a Tube train at Parsons Green. The threat level had remained at the second highest rating, "severe", until Monday. The Northern Ireland threat level specifically refers to threat to the country from Northern Ireland-related terrorism. It remains at severe - the second-highest level. The five levels of threat set by the JTAC are:
The fishing boat, carrying about 350 people of the Muslim Rohingya minority, has been refused entry to Thailand. Those on board told the BBC the crew abandoned them and disabled the engine. They said the bodies of those who had died were thrown overboard. Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand have been turning away migrant boats. 'Desperate sight' Several thousand people are still believed to be stuck in boats off the coasts of Thailand and Malaysia. Most are Rohingya Muslims who cannot go back to Myanmar, also known as Burma, where they are not recognised as citizens of the country and are regularly persecuted. Some of those who are adrift in the Andaman Sea have been provided with food, water and medicine by the Thai navy. It is not clear how many other boats are in a similar predicament. Some boats containing migrants have been towed over to the Malaysian side of the border - where most migrants want to go - only to be taken back into Thai waters. No-one wants them, the BBC's Jonathan Head says, and seeing them off the southern coast of Thailand, near Koh Lipe, that it is a "desperate sight" as they beg for food and water. On one crowded vessel with a lot of women and children on board, our correspondent saw people drinking their own urine from bottles. The migrants - including 50 women and 84 children - said they had been at sea for three months. Their situation became critical when their crew abandoned them without a working engine six days ago anchored near the Thai-Malaysian border. Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division told the BBC: "They're [Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia] playing a game of marine ping-pong not wanting to take in the Rohingyas. He said it was necessary for the three countries to work together in rescuing them before they decide who is going to take responsibility for them. "This is an urgent humanitarian crisis and the Thais and others seem to be taking a gentle stroll." Who are the Rohingyas? Myanmar's unwanted people As many as 8,000 migrants from Bangladesh and Myanmar are believed by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to be stranded at sea. People smugglers are reportedly refusing to land their boats because their usual route through Thailand has been disrupted by a government crackdown. It was launched after the discovery of dozens of bodies in abandoned camps along the land route. A senior Thai official reiterated on Wednesday that Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia would all continue to turn the boats away. On Sunday and Monday more than 2,000 migrants arrived in Malaysia or Indonesia after being rescued or swimming ashore. The journey the migrants take - from Bangladesh or Myanmar through the Bay of Bengal to Thailand or beyond - takes several weeks and has been made by Rohingyas for much of the last 10-15 years. Their journeys have in some cases been further disrupted because they have in effect been held hostage by the people smugglers.
Simon Cheng went missing on 8 August during a business trip to the city but has now returned to Hong Kong. China's foreign ministry said Mr Cheng had been detained for 15 days for violating public security laws. The UK has welcomed his release. It comes as anti-government protests in Hong Kong enter their third month. The large-scale demonstrations were sparked by a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong to send criminal suspects to China for trial. The police said Mr Cheng had been released as scheduled and that his legal rights had been observed, according to a post on the Weibo social media platform. In a Facebook post, the Cheng family said: "Simon has returned to Hong Kong; thank you everyone for your support." It asked for Mr Cheng to be allowed time to recover before any interviews would be allowed. The UK's Foreign Office said: "We welcome the release of Simon Cheng and are delighted that he can be reunited with his family. We will continue to provide support to them." Who is Simon Cheng? Mr Cheng, 28, is a trade and investment officer at the Scottish Development International section of the consulate, reports local outlet HKFP. The report says Mr Cheng studied in Taiwan and the UK before returning to Hong Kong. Mr Cheng travelled to a business event in Shenzhen on 8 August via the Lo Wu crossing. His girlfriend said he planned to travel home by train the same day but did not return. In messages to his girlfriend, he wrote that he was passing through the border, adding "pray for me". What's the latest on the protests? They have entered their 12th straight weekend. A police-approved march has been taking place on Saturday in the industrial Kwun Tong area, attracting more than 1,000 people. Bricks were thrown at one police station and officers fired tear gas in response. Protesters also reportedly pulled down a "smart lamppost", devices that monitor traffic and air quality but which some believe also violate privacy. Hundreds of pro-government supporters have picketed the Kowloon Tong HQ of public broadcaster RTHK, alleging it is biased, the South China Morning Post reported. What is the situation in Hong Kong? The protests were sparked by a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong to send criminal suspects to China for trial. They have grown into a broader movement calling for democratic reform in Hong Kong, and an investigation into alleged police brutality against protesters. Last Sunday, about 1.7 million people attended a pro-democracy rally in central Hong Kong, according to organisers. However police put the figure much lower at 128,000, counting only those at an officially sanctioned rally in the city's Victoria Park. There have been previous protests at Hong Kong International Airport as well as tourist spots in the city. On Friday, YouTube announced it had shut down over 200 channels that it said were part of a "coordinated" attempt to post material about the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. Facebook and Twitter announced on Monday that they had taken steps to block what they described as a state-backed Chinese misinformation campaign on social networks. Twitter said it removed 936 accounts it said were being used to "sow political discord in Hong Kong". A guide to the Hong Kong protests
In an open letter, the firm warned that its YouTube and Search features could be "dramatically worse" if new rules were brought in. It also added that users' data could be shared. But the Australian competition regulator said Google's letter was "misinformation". Over the past few months, the Australian government has been preparing legislation which will make Google and Facebook pay local publishers for their content. Today, Google has said it will fight the regulation which the government says is designed to create "a level playing field" for news outlets. In an open letter, Google's Australia managing director Mel Silva, wrote: "The way Aussies search every day on Google is at risk from new regulation. "You've always relied on Google Search and YouTube to show you what's most relevant and helpful to you. We could no longer guarantee that under this law." Google Search and YouTube services would be "dramatically worse" and the new regulation "could lead to your data being handed over to big news businesses", Ms Silva said. What are the proposals? Last month, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission published draft legislation which called on internet companies such as Facebook and Google to pay for content. It would allow news companies to negotiate as a bloc with tech giants for content which appears in their news feeds and search results. The draft code covers other matters too, including notifying news companies of changes to algorithms. Penalties could be up to A$10m (£5m; $7m) per breach, or 10% of the company's local turnover. Today, the competition regulator said Google's open letter "contains misinformation" about the proposed law. "Google will not be required to charge Australians for the use of its free services such as Google Search and YouTube, unless it chooses to do so," Rod Sims, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman said in a statement. "Google will not be required to share any additional user data with Australian news businesses unless it chooses to do so." Mr Sims said the new regulations would "address a significant bargaining power imbalance" between Australian news media and internet organisations. "A healthy news media sector is essential to a well-functioning democracy," he added.
Panorama has seen accounts from 106,000 clients in 203 countries, leaked by whistleblower Herve Falciani in 2007. The documents include details of almost 7,000 clients based in the UK. HSBC admitted that it was "accountable for past control failures." But it said it has now "fundamentally changed". "We acknowledge that the compliance culture and standards of due diligence in HSBC's Swiss private bank, as well as the industry in general, were significantly lower than they are today," it added. The bank now faces criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina, but not in the UK, where HSBC is based. HSBC said it is "co-operating with relevant authorities". Treasury minister David Gauke defended the government's actions on tax avoidance in the House of Commons after Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood Shabana Mahmood tabled an urgent question. He insisted that the Treasury approach has been "very successful", saying it has sought prosecution for "serial tax evaders" and raised extra tax revenue. Offshore accounts are not illegal, but many people use them to hide cash from the tax authorities. And while tax avoidance is perfectly legal, deliberately hiding money to evade tax is not. The French authorities concluded in 2013 that 99.8% of their citizens on the list were probably evading tax. Joint investigation The thousands of pages of data were obtained by the French newspaper Le Monde. In a joint investigation, the documents have now been passed to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the Guardian newspaper, Panorama and more than 50 media outlets around the world. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) was given the leaked data in 2010 and has identified 1,100 people from the list of 7,000 British clients who had not paid their taxes. But almost five years later, only one tax evader has been prosecuted. HMRC said £135m in tax, interest and penalties have now been paid by those who hid their assets in Switzerland. But the chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge MP, said: "I just don't think the tax authorities have been strong enough, assertive enough, brave enough, tough enough in securing for the British taxpayer the monies that are due." HSBC did not just turn a blind eye to tax evaders - in some cases it broke the law by actively helping its clients. The bank gave one wealthy family a foreign credit card so they could withdraw their undeclared cash at cashpoints overseas. HSBC also helped its tax-dodging clients stay ahead of the law. When the European Savings Directive was introduced in 2005, the idea was that Swiss banks would take any tax owed from undeclared accounts and pass it to the taxman. It was a tax designed to catch tax evaders. But instead of simply collecting the money, HSBC wrote to customers and offered them ways to get round the new tax. HSBC denies that all these account holders were evading tax. 'Dodge liabilities' Richard Brooks, a former tax inspector and author of The Great Tax Robbery, said: "I think they were a tax avoidance and tax evasion service. I think that's what they were offering. They knew full well that people come to them to dodge their tax liabilities." The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative peer and appointed to the government. Lord Green was made a minister eight months after HMRC had been given the leaked documents from his bank. He served as a minister of trade and investment until 2013. He told Panorama: "As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present." HSBC's Swiss accounts in numbers 106,000 clients with Swiss bank accounts 203 countries involved $118bn total assets held in Swiss accounts 11,235 clients from Switzerland held $31.2bn 9,187 clients from France held $12.5bn 7,000 clients from UK held $21.7bn Treasury minister David Gauke defended Lord Green's appointment on BBC's Radio 4. "I am not aware of any evidence that suggests that Lord Green was involved in this sort of activity", but said he did not know whether anyone asked him about HSBC prior to his government appointment. But Ms Hodge said: "Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices. "Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer." Verbal messages Meanwhile, HSBC said it has completely overhauled its private banking business and has reduced the number of Swiss accounts by almost 70% since 2007. In a statement, the bank said: "HSBC has implemented numerous initiatives designed to prevent its banking services being used to evade taxes or launder money." The bank said it now puts compliance and tax transparency ahead of profitability. But Panorama has spoken to a whistleblower who said there were still problems with tax dodging at HSBC private bank when she worked there in 2013. Sue Shelley was the private bank's head of compliance in Luxembourg. She said HSBC did not keep its promise to change. "I think the verbal messages were great but they weren't put into practice and that disturbed me greatly," she said. It was her job to make sure HSBC followed the rules, but she said she was sacked after raising concerns. She has since won a tribunal hearing for unfair dismissal.

Carrie GracieChina editor@BBCCarrieon Twitter 'Trump confirms socialism is the way' A week is just a week, but when it comes to strategic focus, China is on course. It's easier to look laser sharp when the competition is in disarray. Here the internal difficulties of the US and the European Union are helpful to China. As Chinese Foreign Ministry official Zhang Jun put it in a discussion with foreign journalists: "If people want to say China has taken a position of leadership, it's not because China suddenly thrust itself forward as a leader. It's because the original front-runners suddenly fell back and pushed China to the front." In the past week alone, a bitter row over the size of the crowd at the Trump inauguration, followed by street protests the next day, underlined the divisions of the world's superpower even at the very moment which was supposed to heal. For China's citizens, brought up to see street protests as dangerous, this was another symptom of dysfunction in a political system they've been taught to distrust. And next, an American president echoed Beijing's message that the mainstream American media can't be trusted. So it's been a week to put a spring in the step of China's communists, to shake off the inferiority complex of an autocratic political system, and even to advance the claim that China's system is superior. Among business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Xi talked the language of global togetherness, but back home his Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the People's Daily, lost no time in declaring the bankruptcy of Western politics. "The emergence of capitalism's social crisis is the most updated evidence to show the superiority of socialism and Marxism," it said. This ideological inoculation is invaluable for Xi Jinping ahead of the vital Communist Party Congress which will clarify China's leadership line-up for the next five years. What's more, greater political confidence at home allows him to focus out. The inauguration of a billionaire celebrity promising to make America great again through building walls confirms the view of some in Beijing that the United States is in terminal decline, and that this is a moment of opportunity for China. President Xi's favourite slogans are the "China Dream" and the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese people". But it's all happening faster than his predecessors could have imagined. It's less than two decades since China fully entered a US-led world of global capitalism. When China joined the World Trade Organization, it complained bitterly about living under rules made by the US and its friends, while fully expecting to live under those rules for decades to come. But November's American presidential election finished what the 2008 financial crisis had begun: a shift in worldview. And now we are one week into the new leadership mission set out by President Xi at Davos. In comparison, Xi Jinping looks balanced A word about character. In China there are some who compare Mr Trump's character and leadership style with China's Chairman Mao. They point to the former's relentless tweeting as a new version of the latter's daily deluge of quotations. They note other similarities: the unpredictability, distrust of media, and overwhelming self-confidence. Some admire and some despise, but Donald Trump, they say, is a great disrupter in the Maoist mould. All of which is a discussion which takes some of the heat off President Xi at home. Until recently critics accused him of Maoist tendencies after his relentless concentration of titles and power and his frenetic media personality cult. But as China's citizens look out on a world of strongmen this week, their own president may seem comparatively sober, predictable and experienced: not too much the Caesar, nor too little, for a global leader in our age. China becomes the voice of globalisation Meanwhile Mr Xi's outward facing message, that China wants a world of fair trade and globalisation, got a boost this week from several quarters, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The Chinese-led development bank said it is set for expansion. It currently has nearly 60 members and now says another 25 are likely to join this year. Two years ago when the AIIB was launched, it became a symbol of the pulling power of China's money and nimble diplomacy when US allies lined up to join despite strong US opposition. This week, AIIB president Jin Liqun told journalists, it was China's turn to contribute to the world: "China needs to do something that can help it be recognised as a responsible leader." But in the long view, if this week is to be remembered as a tipping point towards Chinese power, it will not be because of anything announced in Beijing but because of what happens in Washington. One of President Trump's first acts in office was to sign an executive order withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact which the Obama administration had insisted would cement US leadership in Asia. "Protection will lead to greater strength", said Mr Trump. But in an open letter, outgoing US ambassadors in the region disagreed. "Walking away from TPP may be seen by future generations as the moment America chose to cede leadership to others in this part of the world and accept a diminished role." Certainly in response to the Trump announcement, US ally and TPP signatory Australia immediately said it hoped to recast the trade agreement without the US, and said China might be invited to join. China remains unchallenged in Asia... Asia is the key testing ground where the US stands in the way of China's ambitions. Since the end of World War Two, Washington has insisted that the US is in Asia for the good of all and invested decades in diplomacy and defence to maintain the liberal international order. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump expressed impatience with that investment. And having withdrawn from the TPP, the Trump administration will have to find a new way to nurture key allies and partners in the region and to reassure them that 'America first' does not mean everyone else last. But at the same moment, China's diplomats and bankers are stepping up their efforts and their focus does not waver. Last year, Beijing turned an international legal defeat over the South China Sea into a diplomatic triumph by charming and disarming the Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. In the Trump era, it has other US allies in its sights. Only this week, Thailand confirmed funding for the purchase of a Chinese submarine. ... and not afraid to defend itself But on security, the week also saw a cloud on China's leadership horizon. The new White House spokesman Sean Spicer seemed to echo warnings to China from incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he sketched out a position on the South China Sea. "We're going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country," said Mr Spicer. It's not clear exactly what he meant or exactly what Mr Tillerson meant, but a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman immediately restated China's claim to sovereignty in the region, and insisted that Beijing would be resolute in defending its own rights and interests. If the Trump administration is to push back against China in the South China Sea it will need support from US allies who ask themselves whether Mr Trump has the strategic focus necessary for such a risky undertaking. China will naturally encourage those doubts given its preference for making domination of the South China Sea a fait accompli with as little fuss as possible. But there are many players, many unpredictable variables and many wrong moves in this game. One week into the new world order, China's leaders may feel some things are playing into their hand. But it will be many months, perhaps years, before they can judge whether China's global gamble is a win against Trump's America.
By Kelly-Leigh CooperBBC News It emerged this week just how vast a chunk of the family's wealth belongs to the 20-year-old. Despite Kim's initial eclipsing fame, Forbes magazine says Kylie is now worth almost three times as much as her sister at an estimated $900m (£680m). The magazine lauded her for heading towards becoming one of the youngest "self-made" billionaires ever. Given her background, many online scoffed at the title, but the impressiveness of the speed of her business success is harder to mock. Kylie Cosmetics is by far her biggest earner. It's not sold in stores and does not advertise traditionally, because unlike other competitors it doesn't seem to need it. After all, Kylie is a social media powerhouse. When she tweeted that she was "sooo over" Snapchat earlier this year, its shares tumbled. The vast majority of her 110 million-strong Instagram following are young and female, fitting firmly within the brand's target market. Her success can be viewed squarely within larger trends in the global beauty industry, which has undergone a huge shift as social media influencers and vloggers become more important to a brand's success. Kylie launched her first set of own-brand lip kits in November 2015. The product choice was not incidental, as the internet had spent much of the previous two years speculating on the teen's noticeably larger lips. At first the reality star alleged the change was achieved using clever make-up tricks (over-lining the lips and filling in with a natural-looking matte base). Some mocked and sparked a viral, and painful, challenge to plump their own lips, but beauty bloggers avidly recreated her look. The products she was rumoured to use sold out at MAC outlets across the world. Kylie and "momager" Kris saw an opportunity to go it alone. She spent months trailing an initial three-shade launch of lip kits - a combination of nude lip liner and matte lip cream combos - on Instagram and Snapchat. The initial stock launch sold out in less than a minute, crashing the website. Bloggers offered suggestions of "dupe" options for those not lucky enough to grab their own, and the $29 (£22) dollar sets were bootlegged online for hundreds of dollars. After launching the debut kits, she relabelled her business Kylie Cosmetics and sales continue to soar, making a reported $19m in one day in late 2016. In just a couple of years she has amassed a reported $630m (£470m) in sales, diversifying from lip kit duos to other products such as glosses, highlighters and eye-shadows. The brand has kept people hooked by maintaining the initial FOMO (fear of missing out) exclusivity - using countdowns to reveal products and selling them on limited release, often in collaboration with her famous siblings. Kylie Cosmetics is not alone; a host of grassroots brands such as Huda beauty and Anastasia Beverley Hills have soared in popularity in recent years. YouTube endorsements in particular have the power to make a product a "must have". A seismic change Stephanie Saltzman, beauty editor at Fashionista, says it cannot be overstated how significant influencers and online marketing have been. She describes the recent change as a "democratisation" within an industry that she believed had gone stale in its approach. "Maybe historically consumers would use what their Mom used, or would go explore a beauty counter in a department store. Now it's in the palm of their hands through social media," she says. "It feels more authentic coming from a person and Kylie Jenner is a person as opposed to a blanket, faceless corporation." Traditional make-up brands are adjusting, though. Some have collaborated with influencers and beauty vloggers on limited-edition lines or have enlisted to use Generation Z celebrities such as Lily-Rose Depp to be their public face. Charlotte Libby, a colour cosmetics expert at analyst group Mintel, says young consumers are rejecting traditional advertising, instead being drawn to brand transparency, and especially "personality, belief and ethics". "Crowdfunding campaigns and social media have brought down some of the barriers for new brands and levelled the playing field," she tells the BBC. "Social media and the success of influencers has proved that personality sells, and partnering with real people, rather than traditional media, offers brand the opportunity to show more personality." The Forbes cover profile points out that the overhead size of Kylie's company is exceptionally small. It has only 12 employees, and only seven are full-time. Most of the company's operations and production needs are outsourced to specialist firms. "As ultra light start ups go, Jenner's operation is essentially air. And because of those miniscule overhead and marketing costs, the profits are outsize and go right into Jenner's pocket," journalist Natalie Robehmed writes. Kylie's self-driven success and huge profits haven't been lost on sister Kim, who has followed suit by launching a new beauty line of her own and a range of new fragrances. After a social-media-heavy marketing campaign that involved sending elaborately packaged perfumes to celebrities and influencers, Kim's initial fragrance offering sold out rapidly, raking in $10m (£7.5m) before a single paying customer had even smelt the products. "I think that was definitely a wake-up call for a lot of others in the industry, and the same can be said with Kylie and everything she has accomplished," says Fashionista editor Saltzman. "I think they feel threatened and also feel inspired. I interviewed Kim right after that fragrance launch and she was saying some big corporations had come to her for advice." In the beauty industry in particular then, it seems that the Kardashians might actually be the ones to keep up with.
The US soldier then known as Pte First Class Bradley Manning lip-synced to Lady Gaga while downloading thousands of classified documents from military servers, according to a computer hacker she befriended. The 29-year-old is six years into what would have been a 35-year sentence, after being convicted of 20 charges in connection with the leaks, including espionage. She was acquitted of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy. After her sentencing, Pte Manning, who was born a man, said she wanted to live as a woman and had taken the name Chelsea. Her time in prison has seen her engage in a fight with the army over receiving gender reassignment surgery, a fight that also saw her attempt to take her own life. In November, she urged then-President Obama to reduce the remainder of her sentence to the six years she has already served. She said she took "full and complete responsibility" for her actions, and was not asking for a pardon. Three days before he left office, he granted her wish. 'Funny little character' As an intelligence analyst in the US Army, Pte Manning was given access to a large amount of highly sensitive information. But as a private first class, she was very low-ranking with a relatively meagre wage. According to her friends, she had become frustrated with a military career that appeared to be stagnating. And her personal life appears to have hit a downward spiral after she was posted to Iraq in 2009. Pte Manning joined the army in 2007 after drifting through low-paid jobs. Born in December 1987, she was brought up in Crescent, a small town in Oklahoma. Her father, Brian, reportedly spent five years in the military. But her parents divorced when she was a teenager, and she moved with her mother to Haverfordwest in south-west Wales. As a teenager, she was said to have been a hothead who was often teased for being a geek. A friend from Wales, James Kirkpatrick, told the BBC she was a "funny little character, really on the ball" who was obsessed with computers. After finishing school, she returned to the US and joined the army. Friends say she enlisted to help pay for college, and she later said she had joined up in the hope the army would rid her of her desire to be a woman. She was deployed to Iraq in October 2009. But messages she posted on Facebook suggest she was far from happy. She wrote in early May 2010 on the site that she was "beyond frustrated with people and society at large". A week earlier, she had written: "Bradley Manning is now left with the sinking feeling that he doesn't have anything left." Some of the postings appear to refer to a recent breakdown of a relationship. But weeks later her words appeared prophetic when she was arrested by military investigators on suspicion of stealing secret information. Self-confessed computer hacker Adrian Lamo told the world's media how Pte Manning had admitted the data theft during conversations they had on the internet. "Listened and lip-synced to Lady Gaga's Telephone while exfiltrating possibly the largest data spillage in American history," Pte Manning wrote, according to a transcript of their messages published on Wired's website. "Weak servers, weak logging, weak physical security, weak counter-intelligence, inattentive signal analysis… a perfect storm." Mr Lamo went to the authorities with the messages. During a sentencing hearing at her court martial in August 2013, a military psychiatrist testified that Pte Manning had struggled with her gender identity and wanted to become a woman. In March 2011, the US Army charged Pte Manning with 22 counts relating to the unauthorised possession and distribution of more than 720,000 secret diplomatic and military documents. Among the files she passed to Wikileaks was video footage of an Apache helicopter killing 12 civilians in Baghdad in 2007. Wikileaks released tens of thousands of documents relating to the Afghan war. The website later disclosed thousands of sensitive messages written by US diplomats and military records from the Iraq war, causing growing embarrassment to the US government. Pte Manning told the court she had leaked the documents to spark a public debate in the US about the role of the military and about US foreign policy. At a later sentencing hearing, she apologised for "hurting the US" and said she had mistakenly believed she could "change the world for the better". 'I am Chelsea Manning' A day after she was sentenced to 35 years in prison, Pte Manning said she wanted to live as a woman. "I am Chelsea Manning," she said in statement to NBC's Today programme. "I am a female." She said she had felt female since childhood, wanted at once to begin hormone therapy, and wished to be addressed as Chelsea. In 2014, a military judge granted Manning's official name change from "Bradley Edward Manning" to "Chelsea Elizabeth Manning" and she was later approved for hormone therapy . She tried twice to take her own life during her time at Leavenworth prison in Kansas. It was later reported this was because of her ongoing fight for gender reassignment surgery. Her lawyer also said she had spent long stretches in solitary confinement. In 2016, she went on hunger strike, before bringing it to an end after the army agreed to provide her with the surgery. During her time in prison, the US Department of Defense lifted a longstanding ban against transgender men and women serving openly in the military. Manning is expected to complete her gender transition after her release.
"I'm confident we can get this done," Mr Obama said at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) talks. Nine Apec nations are involved in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), but China has so far not expressed interest in joining the talks. In all, 21 Apec countries account for about 44% of global trade. They also make up some 40% of the world's population. Speaking in Honolulu on Saturday, Mr Obama said: "Together we can boost exports and create more goods available for our consumers, create new jobs. Compete, win in the markets of the future." Iran response Describing the region as an engine for growth, he expressed hopes that the TPP deal could be finalised as early as next year. The US leader also said the TPP could serve as a model for other trade pacts. He did not provide further details about the plan. Mr Obama had separate meetings with the Chinese and Russian Presidents, on the sidelines of the Apec summit. In his meeting with the Chinese President, Hu Jintao, Mr Obama pressed him to allow the Chinese currency, the yuan, to rise, and on the need for a rebalancing of the global economy, White House officials said. Mr Obama also warned the Chinese president that Americans were becoming impatient over US-China economic ties. In his meeting with the Russian President, Dmitry Medvedev, Mr Obama discussed Afghanistan, Iran and Syria, among other subjects. Mr Obama said they "reaffirmed our intention to work and shape a common response so we can move Iran to follow its international obligations when it comes to its nuclear programme". Japan 'boldness' The TPP currently includes Chile, New Zealand, Brunei and Singapore - all relatively small economies - with the US, Australia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Peru negotiating to join. And Japan, the world's third largest economy, has now said it also wants to join the discussions. President Obama said he had been "extremely impressed with the boldness" of the Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, whose decision to join free trade talks is strongly opposed by Japan's farmers. Mr Obama spoke after holding his first substantive talks with the new Japanese Prime Minister at the Apec summit. Mr Noda told the US president that he was beginning steps to "review Japan's beef import restrictions and expand market access for US beef", the White House said in a statement. While not taking part in the TPP discussions, Chinese President Hu Jintao said in Honolulu that he backed a long-term goal of negotiating a free trade area in the region, which could in future include all Apec members. Mr Hu said Beijing would focus on innovation and encourage investment overseas. The BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington says the US sees Asia as essential to America's future, both economically and strategically.
It said it took the step because a surge in new arrivals had resulted in a threat to public order. At a summit in Malta, EU Council President Donald Tusk said that saving the EU's Schengen rules on free movement was a "race against time". The EU has agreed to a €1.8bn (£1.3bn) fund to help Africa tackle "the root causes of irregular migration". But some African leaders have already criticised the sum being offered as insufficient. Some 150,000 people from African countries such as Eritrea, Nigeria and Somalia have crossed the Mediterranean from Africa this year, but this has been dwarfed by the arrival of some 650,000 people - mostly Syrians - via Turkey and Greece. Tensions in the EU have been rising because of the pressures faced by those countries where most migrants initially arrive, particularly Greece, Italy and Hungary. Many then head to Germany or Sweden - the two nations regarded as the most welcoming to refugees - to claim asylum. Mr Tusk said recent developments in Sweden, Germany, Slovenia and elsewhere had shown "with utmost clarity the huge pressure member states are facing". 'Another system' needed Sweden said the temporary controls came into effect at midday local time on Thursday and will last initially for 10 days. Checks began on trains crossing the Oresund Bridge between Sweden and Denmark and at terminals for ferries arriving from Denmark and Germany. Police indicated not all vehicles crossing the bridge would be checked. Nearly 200,000 migrants are expected to arrive in Sweden this year, more per head of population than any other EU nation. "This is not an issue for one or two or three countries - this is an issue for the whole European Union," Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said at the Malta talks. "We need another system - that is obvious." More on the migrant crisis Katya Adler - How Sweden's far-right has gained from the crisis Crisis in graphics - Migrant countries of origin, routes and destinations Impact of arrivals - How one German city is coping Swedish Interior Minister Anders Ygeman said the centre-left government had acted "in order to obtain security and stability... not to limit the number of asylum seekers, but to get better control of the flow of asylum seekers to Sweden". Swedish immigration officials say the introduction of temporary border controls will help them register new arrivals and prevent people from staying in the country illegally. Fredrik Bengtsson, spokesman for the Swedish Migration Agency, said it was currently picking up people by bus at the border and driving them to its offices, but "once they get there quite a lot don't enter and get registered but disappear". Cash for help The summit of EU and African leaders in the Maltese capital Valletta was planned after about 800 people died in a migrant boat sinking off Libya in April. It has been looking at ways to reduce the flow of migrants by helping tackle economic and security problems in African states, and at accelerating repatriation of failed asylum-seekers. African leaders are insisting on a much clearer path for smaller numbers of their citizens to migrate officially to Europe. Also on Thursday, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, asked EU member states to donate a total of €2.5bn to a fund to support Turkey's efforts to tackle the migration crisis. Analysis: Chris Morris, BBC News, Valletta It is almost always a good idea to get together, shake hands and smile - the importance of political engagement at the very highest level should not be under-estimated. But there are still some fairly fundamental differences of emphasis between Europe and Africa when it comes to how best to tackle the migration crisis. That is hardly surprising because it is a one-way street - an unequal partnership. And efforts to balance things up involve policies such as conflict resolution and poverty reduction that will take decades to bear fruit. The trust fund established today is new money and it will fund new projects. African leaders would like it to be bigger, but overall this deal can have a positive impact. One practical example is a European promise to reduce the cost to migrant workers of sending money back to Africa. Remittances remain a backbone of many national economies. Nevertheless there remains deep scepticism in Africa about European demands to accept the return of far more of the people that EU countries want to expel. That will remain a serious point of contention. Despite a series of high-level meetings over the migration crisis, the EU remains deeply divided on how to deal with the issue. Hungary has criticised Germany's announcement that it planned to send more Syrian refugees back to the first EU country they had entered - excluding Greece - and Croatia has condemned its neighbour Slovenia for building a razor-wire fence along their mutual border. EU leaders have agreed a controversial programme to redistribute thousands of migrants - but so far only about 130 have been successfully moved from Greece and Italy. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent Andrew Hamilton told a university gathering the real cost of an Oxford undergraduate course was £16,000. He asked how a "market" in higher education could operate if everything "regardless of content and quality, is the same price". The university faced an annual funding gap of £70m, said Prof Hamilton. He argued that different types of institutions should be able to charge different levels of fees. Funding shortfall "Given the great diversity of the institutions in our higher education system, the notion of different universities charging significantly different amounts, doesn't feel inherently unnatural. "It is the current situation that seems out of kilter. What matters surely is that an institution's charges are clearly aligned with what it offers and that they are demonstrably not a barrier to student access." A university spokesman said that the speech was not proposing that students would have to pay fees of £16,000 per year to bridge the shortfall. But Prof Hamilton suggested a "system of tuition charges more closely related to the true cost", with the "strongest guarantees" of support for poorer students. Prof Hamilton argued that there needed to be a more sustainable funding model for universities where £9,000 did not cover their costs. He had heard that some universities were "doing very nicely thank you" with fees of £9,000. "That may or may not be the case for them, but one thing I am quite sure about is that it doesn't add up for Oxford, where the new regime of increased tuition charges for students, but greatly reduced government spending on teaching, have done little to change the basic financial equation." Along with ideas such as increasing philanthropic donations, he floated the idea of raising funds through issuing bonds to investors. The raising of tuition fees to £9,000 was a highly controversial measure, prompting violent protests and occupations, in the biggest upsurge of student activism for decades. Academics at the University of Oxford passed a symbolic motion of no confidence in Universities Minister David Willetts and his higher education funding reforms. But with the funding changes in place, the speech on Tuesday by Prof Hamilton shows there are still far-reaching financial questions for such leading institutions. How can they compete on an international stage with better-funded rivals? Harvard University's financial figures, released last month, showed the US university has an endowment that has grown to $32.7bn (£20.3bn). A fundraising drive by Harvard, launched last month, aims to raise an additional $6.5bn (£4bn). Last year, Oxford hailed the donation of £75m as "the largest such benefaction for undergraduate financial support in European university history". Responding to the speech, Sally Hunt, general secretary of the UCU lecturers' union said: "Prof Hamilton should perhaps be applauded for going after one of the rawest nerves in politics to try and get higher education funding back in the spotlight - something we fear no party will be keen to do this side of the general election. "However, higher university fees are not what this country needs. "Prof Hamilton is correct to say our universities need more funding - we invest just 1.4% of GDP on higher education, compared to an international average of 1.7%. "However, he is wrong to argue that students should pick up tab when we already have the most expensive fees in Europe."
It is the social networking giant's biggest acquisition to date. WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly users and is popular with people looking to avoid text messaging charges. In a statement announcing the deal, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg described WhatsApp's services as "incredibly valuable". WhatsApp allows users to send messages over internet connections, avoiding text messaging fees. The company claims it is currently registering one million new users a day. It makes money by charging users a subscription fee of $1 per year, although it offers a free model as well. Silicon Valley's newest billionaires The deal to buy it includes $4bn in cash and approximately $12bn-worth of Facebook shares, plus an additional $3bn in stock to WhatsApp's founders and employees at a later date. On a conference call to discuss the deal, WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum said he planned to operate the firm "independently and autonomously". He will also become a member of Facebook's board of directors. "We're excited and honoured to partner with Mark and Facebook as we continue to bring our product to more people around the world," Mr Koum said in a statement. Mr Zuckerberg said the prospect of a deal was first floated just 11 days ago. The Facebook founder said he believed WhatsApp was on track to have a billion users, but insisted he had no plans to place advertising on WhatsApp's interface, saying he did not think ads were the best way to make money from messaging systems. Once the deal is finalised, Mr Koum and co-founder Brian Acton are set to become Silicon Valley's newest billionaires. WhatsApp has about 50 employees in total. Siphoning billions Cathy Boyle, a senior analyst at research firm eMarketer, said WhatsApp was valuable to Facebook for several reasons beyond advertising, including its younger user base and its popularity overseas. "WhatsApp actually has greater penetration in a lot of international markets than Facebook," Ms Boyle told the BBC. She added that it was notable that Facebook's chief financial officer David Ebersman referred to the telecommunications industry when discussing the firm's purchase. "WhatsApp is trying to siphon the billions that the telecom industry would make from [traditional SMS text messaging]" she said. Ben Bajarin, from California-based technology consultants Creative Strategies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the deal would allow Facebook to tap into a rapidly growing market. "WhatsApp is on a path towards a billion users," he said. "They're growing exponentially - much, much faster than Facebook. "For Facebook this is a key growth area where, even if they don't monetise this product, this is a way that Facebook can get the next billion smartphone consumers into their ecosystem... to touch them and engage with them in other ways than just the Facebook platform." Shares in Facebook dropped 5% in after hours trading before recovering slightly. Prior to this acquisition, Facebook's biggest purchase had been Instagram for $1bn in 2012. It had also reportedly offered $3bn to acquire photo messaging service Snapchat.
Michel Barnier said he was "not in the frame of mind to make concessions or ask for concessions". UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said talks got off to a "promising start". The UK appears to have conceded to the EU's preferred order for the talks which will mean trade negotiations do not begin immediately. Mr Davis and Mr Barnier gave a joint press conference after day one of the talks in Brussels. The initial focus will be on expat rights, a financial settlement and "other separation issues". Discussions aimed at preserving the Good Friday Agreement and common travel area in Ireland will also begin, although Mr Davis suggested these issues may not be settled until the end of the process, when the UK's trade relationship with the EU is settled. The UK had wanted talks on its future relationship with the EU to be considered from the outset, but Mr Barnier said this would only happen once the European Council decided "sufficient progress has been made" on the other issues. Mr Davis - who had predicted this would be the "row of the summer" - denied suggestions the agreed timetable showed Britain's "weakness" and insisted it was "completely consistent" with the government's aim of parallel trade and exit talks. "It's not when it starts it's how it finishes that matters," he said. Asked whether he had made any concessions to the UK in return, Mr Barnier said the UK had decided to leave the EU - not the other way around, and each side had to "assume our responsibility and the consequences of our decisions". "I am not in a frame of mind to make concessions, or ask for concessions," he said. "It's not about punishment, it is not about revenge. "Basically, we are implementing the decision taken by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and unravel 43 years of patiently-built relations. "I will do all I can to put emotion to one side and stick to the facts, the figures, and the legal basis, and work with the United Kingdom to find an agreement in that frame of mind." Who is in charge? Laura Kuennsberg, BBC political editor It's often compared to a divorce - the UK wanted to talk about who gets the house and the CD collection at the same time as settling who pays for the kids' weddings in 20 years' time. The EU on the other hand have been firm all along that the future arrangements could only be discussed once the terms of the initial split have been agreed. The debate was called "parallelism versus sequentialism" and from this afternoon's press conference and the announcement of the procedure it is clear that the UK has lost. Ministers believed they would be able to persuade the EU - the failure to do so has been described as a "total cave-in". The discussion was even predicted by Mr Davis as likely to be the "row of the summer". The row won't happen because it seems the UK has already given in. Read more from Laura Mr Barnier said a "fair deal" was possible "and far better than no deal". He promised to work with, not against, the UK. "We must lift the uncertainty caused by Brexit," he said. The two men - who exchanged gifts at the start of the talks - set out the structure for the initial negotiations. There will be one week of negotiations every month. Working groups of "senior experts" will be set up to focus on the three main areas. On citizens' rights, which the UK has said should be an immediate priority, Mr Davis said there was "much common ground". The UK is set to leave the EU by the end of March 2019, following last year's referendum vote. Prior to the start of talks, Mr Davis gave his counterpart a first edition of a mountaineering book - a French-language version of Regards vers Annapurna - while Mr Barnier reciprocated with a traditional, hand-carved walking stick from Savoie, complete with leather wrist strap. Who's who in the UK delegation? After holding talks with Theresa May in Downing Street, new Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said there must be no return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and economic borders must be "invisible". While he said he regretted Mrs May's decision to leave the single market and customs union, he said the two had a shared objective to minimise disruption to trade after the UK's exit. Earlier former Marks and Spencer chairman Lord Rose, who chaired the Stronger In campaign last year, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was reassured that economic considerations were "top of the pile" but ministers needed to be realistic with the public. Speaking on the same programme, JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin - one of the leading pro-Leave business voices - said negotiators had to be open to possible compromises but also prepared to walk away and to default to World Trade Organization rules if necessary. "I don't think many people feel that staying in the single market and customs union and being subject to EU laws is Brexit. "I think Brexit is parliamentary sovereignty and an assertion of democracy. Outside that, I think there is a quite a lot of scope," Mr Martin said. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said there was "real confusion" about the government's mandate after the general election result.
If confirmed by the Senate, the 49-year-old would restore the court's conservative majority, lost with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The Senate Democratic leader has said he has "very serious doubts" about Judge Gorsuch's nomination. The court has the final legal word on many of the most sensitive US issues, from abortion to gender to gun control. Mr Trump said Judge Gorsuch had a "superb intellect, an unparalleled legal education, and a commitment to interpreting the Constitution according to text". "Judge Gorsuch has outstanding legal skills, a brilliant mind, tremendous discipline, and has earned bipartisan support," Mr Trump said. He was picked from a shortlist of 21 choices, which Mr Trump made public during the election campaign. Accepting the nomination, he said: "It is the role of judges to apply, not alter, the work of the people's representatives. A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge, stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands." Judge Gorsuch is a so-called originalist, meaning he believes the US Constitution should be followed as the Founding Fathers intended. If successful, his nomination will restore the 5-4 conservative majority on the nine-seat high court. Protests against Mr Trump's choice were held outside the Supreme Court following the announcement. More on this story Where does Judge Gorsuch stand on key issues? Abortion: He has not spoken out about Roe v Wade, the case which legalised abortion nationwide in 1973, making in difficult to pin down where he stands on the issue. Birth control: Judge Gorsuch has supported religious institutions which objected to requirements for employers to provide access to contraception. In one of his most high-profile cases, he defended the religious owners of retailer Hobby Lobby who refused to fund birth control via staff health insurance. Gun rights: He hasn't ruled directly on firearms restrictions, but is thought to be generally pro-second amendment. He once wrote in a legal opinion that a citizen's right to bear arms "must not be infringed lightly". Euthanasia: He has been vocal about assisted dying, writing a book in 2009 which opposed legalisation. A conservative's dream: Anthony Zurcher, North America Reporter Donald Trump's choice of Neil Gorsuch as his Supreme Court nominee is a fairly traditional pick in a decidedly untraditional time. Judge Gorsuch has a CV and background that would make him a natural selection for just about any Republican president. He's the kind of Supreme Court nominee evangelical and traditional conservative voters dreamed of as a reward for sticking with Mr Trump through the general election despite campaign missteps, controversies and occasional political apostasies. They knew they would get a court pick they wouldn't like if Hillary Clinton won. They hoped they would get someone like Judge Gorsuch if Mr Trump prevailed. Meanwhile, Democrats are left fuming over Senate Republicans' precedent-breaking decision to stymie Barack Obama's attempts to fill this court vacancy for nearly 10 months. They have to decide if they will try to derail Mr Gorsuch's nomination as retribution - perhaps forcing Republicans to break with another Senate tradition, the ability of a minority to a block a Supreme Court nominee with only 41 votes through a filibuster. The party's base, feeling a liberal majority on the court was stolen from them, will demand lockstep resistance, likely setting up a divisive confirmation fight ahead. Can Democrats block the nomination? Judge Gorsuch's nomination is expected to spark a political showdown in the Senate. Former President Barack Obama had put forward Judge Merrick Garland after Justice Scalia's death last February. But Republicans refused to debate the choice, saying it was too close to an election, which left Democrats embittered. Even if Judge Gorsuch makes it through the Senate Judiciary Committee, he will still face challenges when the entire chamber convenes for a final vote. Democrats may seek to prevent that second vote by prolonging or filibustering the debate. In that case, the nomination would need 60 votes rather than a simple majority. With Republicans only holding 52 Senate seats, they may have to change Senate rules in order to approve Mr Trump's nominee. Why is the choice so important? The highest court in the US is often the ultimate arbiter on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. It hears fewer than 100 cases a year and the key announcements are made in June. Each of the nine justices serves a lifetime appointment after being nominated by the president and approved by the Senate. The court already has cases this term on the rights of transgender students, gerrymandered voting districts and on the Texas death penalty determination. It is also likely the court will hear cases on voter rights, abortion, racial bias in policing and US immigration policy, and possibly on Mr Trump's controversial executive order banning refugees.

Alibaba was taken off the list four years ago, but US authorities say the firm's online platform Taobao is used to sell "high levels" of fake goods. The company has rejected the allegations, insisting it polices its market place better than in the past. The firm also suggested the "current political climate" in the US might be why they are back on the list. US President-elect Donald Trump had, during his campaign, repeatedly accused Chinese firms of stealing intellectual property. Alibaba Group President Michael Evans said he was "disappointed" by the decision and questioned whether it was "based on actual facts or was influenced by the current political climate." The Chinese online retailer and its market place Taobao have long been accused of being a platform for counterfeit goods. Taobao said earlier this year it had tightened controls on its sale of luxury goods, requiring sellers to show proof of authenticity. In May though, Alibaba was suspended from the International Anti Counterfeiting Coalition (IACC) watchdog over piracy concerns. Some members, including Gucci America and Michael Kors, had threatened they would leave the IACC in protest at Alibaba's membership. Alibaba - by far China's biggest online retailer - floated on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2014 and broke records by raising $25bn.
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) thinks the second quarter, starting in April, will see GDP exceed the level seen at the start of 2008. In upgraded forecasts, it estimates economic growth will be 2.8% this year - up from its earlier estimate of 2.7%. But it also warns of an "unacceptably high" level of youth unemployment. 'Sunny predictions' "Our economic recovery is gaining momentum," said BCC director general John Longworth. "Businesses across the UK are expanding and creating jobs, and our increasingly sunny predictions for growth are a testament to their drive and ambition." In December, the BCC forecast economic growth would reach pre-recession levels by the autumn. It has also upgraded its growth forecast for 2015, from 2.4% to 2.5%. These more optimistic forecasts, the BCC says, are mainly due to upward revisions to historic GDP data by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The group also predicts the first increase in UK interest rates will come at the end of 2015, rising from their historic low of 0.5% to 0.75%. 'Major issues' It expects further modest increases will see the rate rise to 1.5% by the second half of 2016. But Mr Longworth warned it was not "time to break out the champagne glasses just yet". He added: "Major issues remain, such as the unacceptably high level of youth unemployment. "We urge the chancellor to use this month's Budget wisely by incentivising businesses to hire young people so that the next generation of workers are not left behind." He also called for more business investment and better access to finance for companies. The BCC forecasts are echoed in a separate report, from accountants BDO. It says strong growth is being helped by increased optimism and improved hiring intentions, particularly in manufacturing. Budget backdrop Like the BCC report, BDO's analysis predicts wages will grow above the level of inflation from the middle of this year. Separately, in a report on business confidence, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said one in seven smaller companies wanted to create jobs in the next three months. The FSB also said a growing number of companies were getting access to finance. The upbeat reports follow encouraging economic data in recent months, and provide a positive backdrop to Chancellor George Osborne's Budget announcement on 19 March. He is expected to announce an upgrade to UK growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In December's Autumn Statement, the OBR forecast growth of 2.4% for 2014.
By Tulip MazumdarGlobal health correspondent in San Diego We've been here many times before. In the past five years alone, the world has faced outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, another coronavirus called Mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and now the virus simply known as "2019-nCoV". It's already infected thousands of people and killed more than 100. But unlike in many previous outbreaks, where vaccines to protect people have taken years to develop, research for a vaccine to help stem this outbreak got under way within hours of the virus being identified. Chinese officials released its genetic code very quickly. That information helps scientists determine where the virus probably came from, how it might mutate as the outbreak develops, and how to protect people against it. With technological advances and greater commitment from governments around the world to fund research on emerging diseases, research facilities were able to spring into action fast. Unprecedented speed At Inovio's lab in San Diego, scientists are using a relatively new type of DNA technology to develop a potential vaccine. "INO-4800" - as it's currently called - with plans for it to enter human trials by the early summer. Kate Broderick, senior vice-president of research and development at Inovio, said: "Once China had provided the DNA sequence of this virus, we were able to put it through our lab's computer technology and design a vaccine within three hours. "Our DNA medicine vaccines are novel in that they use DNA sequences from the virus to target specific parts of the pathogen which we believe the body will mount the strongest response to. "We then use the patient's own cells to become a factory for the vaccine, strengthening the body's own natural response mechanisms." Inovio says if the initial human trials are a success, larger trials would follow, ideally in an outbreak setting in China "by the end of the year". It is impossible to predict whether this outbreak is likely to have ended by then. But if Inovio's timeline goes to plan, the company says it will be the quickest a new vaccine has ever been developed and tested in an outbreak situation. The last time a similar virus - Sars - emerged in 2002 - China was slow to let the world know what was happening. So by the time work on a vaccine started in earnest, the outbreak was almost over. The timeline of 2019-nCoV The work in these labs is being funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi), which is made up of and funded by governments and philanthropic organisations from around the world. It was created in the aftermath of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa to provide funding to accelerate the development of vaccines for new diseases. Dr Melanie Saville, director of vaccine research and development at Cepi, said: "The mission is to make sure that outbreaks are no longer a threat to humanity and to develop vaccines for emerging infectious diseases." 'Molecular clamp' Cepi is also funding two other programmes that are developing a vaccine for this new coronavirus. The University of Queensland is working on a "molecular clamp" vaccine, which it says "enables targeted and rapid vaccine production against multiple viral pathogens." Moderna Inc in Massachusetts has also joined forces with the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to accelerate its research. The WHO is co-ordinating this global quest for a new vaccine. It says it is following the progress of a number of research facilities, including the three supported by Cepi. Although efforts to come up with a vaccine for this new coronavirus have been accelerated, research is still at an early stage at all the facilities in the race to find a new vaccine. Clinical trials take time and are best carried out within an outbreak setting. There are no guarantees any of the designs so far will be safe and effective enough to be used in the outbreak in China. Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo from the WHO's Health Emergencies programme said: "We have developed a framework to inform decisions on which candidate vaccine(s) should be tested first. "The experts will consider a number of criteria, including acceptable safety profile, induction of appropriate immune responses, and the timely availability of sufficient supplies of vaccine doses. "Understanding the disease, its reservoirs, its transmission, its clinical severity and developing effective counter measures is critical for the control of the outbreak." The WHO is due to decide which vaccine will be tested on humans first in the coming days. Inovio has announced that it will collaborate with a biotech company in Beijing who can help manage human trials which are due to start in the summer. Dr J. Joseph Kim, president and CEO of Inovio, said: "This collaboration allows us to enter China and deliver our vaccine into the areas where they need it most as soon as possible."

The charges relate to Oradour-sur-Glane in central France, where 642 people were murdered by SS troops in 1944. Many were herded into a local church into which hand grenades were thrown before it was set on fire. Prosecutors in Dortmund said the man had been charged over the murder of 25 people and with aiding and abetting the murder of several hundred. The ruins of the village have been preserved just as they were after the massacre, as a permanent memorial. French leader General Charles de Gaulle said it should be a reminder of the cruelty of the Nazi occupation. Some 60 soldiers were brought to trial in the 1950s. Twenty of them were convicted but all were later released. Doused in petrol German investigators said last year they had opened a new inquiry into the massacre. On Wednesday, the regional court in Cologne said: "The prosecutor's office in Dortmund has charged an 88-year-old from Cologne over the murder of 25 people committed by a group, and with aiding and abetting the murder of several hundred people." The man was named in documents as Werner C, a former member of an SS armoured division who was 19 at the time. His lawyer, Rainer Pohlen, told the Associated Press news agency his client was at the village but had nothing to do with the massacre. Dortmund state prosecutor Andreas Brendel said the accused was among six men still facing possible prosecution. On 10 June 1944, a detachment of SS troops had surrounded the tiny hamlet in the Limousin region. It is believed by some that they were seeking retribution for the kidnap of a German officer but some say that resistance members were based in a different, nearby village. Most of the victims were women and children. The men had been locked in a barn. Machine-gunners shot at their legs, then doused them in petrol and set them alight. The landmark 1970s documentary series, The World at War, both begins and ends with references to Oradour-sur-Glane. Last September German President Joachim Gauck travelled to the village and joined hands with one of the survivors and with French President Francois Hollande, as a sign of reconciliation.
It expects to make an operating profit of 8.4 trillion won ($7.9bn; £4.8bn) for the January-to-March quarter, down 4% from the same period last year. This follows a 6% decline in operating profit in the previous quarter. The drop indicates the challenge faced by Samsung to boost its earnings amid falling prices of smartphones. Young Park, an analyst with Hyundai Securities said that Samsung's profits were being hurt by falling margins for smartphones as well as a slowdown in the growth rate of the sector. Cost cutting? The success of Samsung's Galaxy range of smartphones has been one of the biggest drivers of its growth in recent years. But is has been facing rising competition as companies look to tap into the sector's growth. Rivals Apple, HTC and Chinese manufacturers such as Lenovo, ZTE and Huawei have all been looking to boost their market share. That has prompted vendors to reduce prices to attract more customers, putting pressure on their profit margins. Earlier this year, Samsung had warned that it expects competition in the sector to "intensify" further. One analyst said that as profit margins in the sector continue to fall, Samsung may need to cut costs to sustain its earnings growth. "What Samsung needs to do this year for additional growth are things like cost reduction and reducing marketing costs," said Greg Roh, an analyst with HMC Investment and Securities. "In some sense, Samsung has no way to prevent a decline in its earnings without improving internal efficiencies."
By Laura BickerBBC News, Seoul But focusing on this one image means losing sight of the bigger picture. For the uninitiated, the Korean heart is formed if you put the tips of your thumb and index finger together. It started as a gesture of love used by K-pop stars to thank their fans, and has morphed into the pose of choice for selfies with friends in South Korea. We first heard about Mr Kim's attempt at the gesture from a spokesman for South Korea's Blue House, who told a press conference that he tried to do it alongside South Korean cabinet ministers. "How do you do it? I can't quite make the shape," Mr Kim was quoted as saying. It was another Instagram moment for the North Korean leader. We saw one when he took South Korean President Moon Jae-in's hand on their very first meeting and helped him across the line dividing their two countries. We saw it in the selfies during his walkabout in Singapore the night before his summit with Donald Trump. These social media-friendly snapshots have prompted many in the South to describe him on Twitter as misunderstood, or even cute. They are taking this gesture made at the sacred and mythical home of the Korean nation as a sign he is serious about developing a relationship with the South. It's easy to be swept up by the burgeoning friendship beamed onto our screens. I was watching the images from Mount Paektu stream into the press room and it was difficult to recognise Kim Jong-un as the "madman", "maniac" and "sick puppy" that President Trump described last year. The young leader was laughing and joking with President Moon and his wife. They all clutched hands by the pristine lake. It was a moment of unity in a beautiful setting that would have been unthinkable this time last year. "We had a small group today but in the near future, we hope many South Koreans and expats will be able to come here," the North Korean leader said. "We should write another chapter of history between the North and the South by reflecting our new history on this Heaven Lake." Is this really the murderous dictator with a nuclear arsenal that we are told is a global threat? And then, a few days later the Blue House released the photographs of Mr Kim forming the heart. It is designed to play to a South Korean audience. To further soften his image as he starts to gain almost celebrity status in the South. There was even a suggestion that they could use it as a screensaver. What has gone unsaid is that with a click of those same fingers, Mr Kim could put an end to the crimes against humanity committed in North Korea. With just one command he could free tens of thousands of political prisoners from gulags, including six South Koreans, many of whom are forced to do hard labour. Nor is it mentioned that this gesture so loved by K-pop stars is unknown in the streets of Pyongyang, because even listening to South Korean music is a crime. A UN report released in 2014 concluded that the North Korean government was perpetrating "unspeakable atrocities" against its own people on a vast scale. The Chair of the Commission on human rights said they were "strikingly similar" to crimes committed by Nazi Germany in World War II and that the crimes included execution, enslavement, starvation, rape and forced abortion. Mr Kim himself is suspected of ordering the assassination of his half-brother, Kim Jong-nam, in Malaysia, as well as the execution of his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, in 2013. It's not popular to talk about human rights right now. I alluded to some of North Korea's crimes in a Twitter post and it earned me a stream of criticism from some in the South. I was accused of being a foreigner, pouring cold water on the peace process and of misunderstanding the Korean people. A senior adviser to the Blue House has acknowledged that Pyongyang's violations are a "fundamental dilemma". I spoke to him during the first inter-Korean summit and was told I was the only interviewer that day to bring up the issue of human rights. Now is not the time to enter into those discussions, is the answer I was given. "If we push too hard for human rights, then North Korea would regard us as taking a hostile act against North Korea. Then peace would be jeopardised," said presidential adviser Moon Chung-in. The Blue House adviser went on to tell me that the key was to build trust between the two countries first. The North has issued warnings. Weeks before the first inter-Korean summit, state media told South Korean officials to "behave with discretion" and said criticising the North's rights record was tantamount to "throwing a stone to the thin ice-like North-South relations". As a result, South Korean officials have not made human rights a major feature of the three summits. They have also agreed to stop propaganda broadcasts and leaflet distributions on their border. Instead, the focus is on helping with economic reforms which may in the long-run help North Korean people. President Moon took business leaders to Pyongyang. Professor John Delury from Yonsei University wrote in the New York Times that "we have all grown so accustomed to thinking about North Korea in terms of threat, that it takes some unthinking to see the possibilities". He outlines Mr Kim's dream of being "a great economic reformer". There is certainly a lot of evidence to back it up. Mr Kim has visited factory after factory this year, even chiding officials over building delays and other perceived failures. This approach is beginning to yield some results. Mr Kim has made diplomatic progress with President Moon. The Pyongyang agreement, if fully implemented, has the potential to put the two Koreas on a path towards peace. They announced what amounts to conventional arms control measures, including joint measures to reduce guard posts and manage tensions along the Demilitarised Zone. Mr Kim has agreed to allow international experts to watch the dismantling of Tongchang-ri facility, also known as the Sohae Satellite Launching Station - a well-known site associated with various aspects of the country's space and ballistic missile programmes. President Moon told reporters that Mr Kim was also willing to allow experts to verify the destruction of its only known nuclear weapons testing site at Punggye-ri. But there is an element of showmanship at these summits which could give viewers the impression that North Korea is already changing and that it is slowly opening up. There is no evidence of that. It remains a secretive state and its people are not allowed to offer an opinion on how it is run. Nor are they allowed to leave. The secret police are always watching, according to sources who've visited Pyongyang. The media is also not allowed in unchecked. Defectors continue to document stories of widespread human rights abuses. "North Korean refugees with contacts in the North warn that the dictator has been presenting a smiling face for the world, but that he has cracked down domestically," said Casey Lartigue, co-founder and international director of Teach North Korean Refugees. "The world may see him as a cute smiling guy, but to North Korean refugees, that would mean that he is a comedian with a guillotine. "And any North Koreans who approach the border or want to communicate with the outside world know that their heads will be rolling." Every image from North Korea is tightly controlled. We are shown what they want us to see. Kim Jong-un may look cute forming the Korean heart, but it is the job of journalists to look at this photo from all angles with clear eyes. Even if it is what some South Koreans don't want to hear.
Russia has been hit hard by falling oil prices and by Western sanctions imposed in response to its interventions in the crisis in neighbouring Ukraine. The rouble, once a symbol of stability under Mr Putin, suffered its biggest one-day decline since 1998 on Monday. The government has warned that Russia will fall into recession next year. Speaking to both chambers in the Kremlin, Mr Putin also accused Western governments of seeking to raise a new "iron curtain" around Russia. He expressed no regrets for annexing Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, saying the territory had a "sacred meaning" for Russia. He insisted the "tragedy" in Ukraine's south-east had proved that Russian policy had been right but said Russia would respect its neighbour as a brotherly country. Speaking in Basel in Switzerland later, US Secretary of State John Kerry said the West did not seek confrontation with Russia. "No-one gains from this confrontation... It is not our design or desire that we see a Russia isolated through its own actions," Mr Kerry said. Russia could rebuild trust, he said, by withdrawing support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Analysis: BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow The final draft of Vladimir Putin's annual speech is written by the president himself. It is his view of the state of the Russian nation and outlines his priorities for the year ahead. So it's telling that Mr Putin chose to stress his unwavering hard line on the crisis in Ukraine: what happened in Kiev was an "illegal coup" and Crimea, which Russia annexed, is like "holy land" for Russia and will always be treated that way. Vladimir Putin again accused the West of meddling in Russia's internal affairs and using sanctions to "contain" the country as it grew stronger and more independent. His response was a rallying-cry to Russians to pull together for the good of their country. That included a remarkable call for a one-off amnesty on the return of Russian capital stashed offshore. But people here are starting to feel the economic consequences of their president's defiance, through sanctions. For those who are worried, this speech probably offered little reassurance. Mr Putin's speech came amid continued volatility in the value of the rouble. The currency slid almost 9% against the dollar on Monday, before rallying after a suspected central bank intervention. But on Thursday it weakened again as Mr Putin's speech failed to impress investors. At 14:30 GMT it was 1.6% lower on the day against the dollar. "Not seeing any new big ideas in this speech which are going to help the Russian economy, or ease market pressure on Russian assets," Standard Bank analyst Tim Ash said in a note. "This is old school, Cold War stuff." Over the past year, the rouble has lost around 40% of its value against the dollar and inflation is expected to reach 10% early next year. Russians are believed to have taken more than $100bn (£64bn; €81bn) out of the country this year and Mr Putin promised an amnesty for anyone choosing to bring their money back. He said that they would face no questions over how they had earned it. Other economic measures Mr Putin outlined included: Sanction 'stimulus' Falling oil prices have affected Russia because of the country's reliance on energy exports. Russia's estimate of the cost of sanctions and falling oil prices is $140bn a year. Mr Putin foresaw budget cuts of at least 5% over the next three years but hoped to see a return to above-average economic growth within "three to four years". Stressing that Russia remained "open for the world", Mr Putin suggested Western sanctions should be seen as a stimulus. "We have a huge internal market and resources... capable, intelligent people," he said. "Our people have demonstrated national strength, patriotism - and the difficulties we are facing create new opportunities". Condemning the "pure cynicism" of the West, he suggested that even if Crimea had not been annexed, the West would have come up with a different pretext to impose sanctions to contain Russia's resurgence. Russia, he said, would not enter an "expensive arms race" but would provide its own security. Mr Putin said: "There is no doubt they would have loved to see the Yugoslavia scenario of collapse and dismemberment for us - with all the tragic consequences it would have for the peoples of Russia. This has not happened. We did not allow it." President Putin remains popular, the BBC's Steve Rosenberg reports. One opinion poll this week suggested that 72% of Russians still approved of the way he was running the country.
By James FitzgeraldBBC Minute BBC Minute's team - which provide 24/7 news bulletins for radio stations around the world - believe any challenge can be faced with the right music. We even have a motivational poster that reads: "Make a coffee, put on some gangsta rap, and handle it." It seems that's a view shared by our partner stations in 100 cities across 40 countries. We asked their presenters which songs they're playing to help their listeners get through the pandemic. Consider it your lockdown playlist. 1. Bop Daddy (Falz) - chosen by Ronke from Splash FM in Ibadan, Nigeria Many Nigerians are missing their nights out right now, if the #BopDaddyChallenge is anything to go by. It's a TikTok trend, Ronke explains. Those who would normally go to nightclubs have been taking to social media instead. They picture themselves transitioning from pyjamas into glamorous evening-wear - as if by magic. "They're getting all made up… to go nowhere!" she laughs. The soundtrack to the challenge is a tune by rapper-comedian Falz. "It really is just a guy talking about himself, and how he's going to be your everything," says Ronke. "The lyrics may not always make much sense, but the important thing is that it's fun to dance to while at home." 2. Everything I Wanted (Billie Eilish) - chosen by Tebogo from Gabz FM in Gaborone, Botswana Billie Eilish's sombre song recounts a nightmare in which she takes her own life - but nobody cares. It's hardly music to blast away the lockdown blues. But news reporter Tebogo insists it's an apt choice for the present time, which is why Gabz FM has been playing it loads. "It relates to the state of mind Botswana is in," he says. "There's a bit of uncertainty. You're not sure where things are going to end up. But you have no choice other than to remain hopeful." In her track, Eilish ultimately finds solace in those people closest to her, namely her brother Finneas. 3. Imagine (John Lennon) - chosen by Michael from Metro Plus in Hong Kong John Lennon's famous song appeals for unity and compassion. And Michael at Hong Kong's Metro Plus thinks people in Hong Kong are already showing each other more love than usual. "You see a person without a mask by the roadside and someone will be giving him a helping hand. Before, they wouldn't have even looked at that guy," he says. "This struggle is not between an Asian and an American, an American and a European, or a European and an African. "Humans are up against something (coronavirus) we can't even see. If all we come together, as this song asks, we'll get through it." 4. Mulk Kay Nojawano (traditional) - chosen by Asfandyar from Power 99 in Islamabad, Pakistan Asfandyar's tricky task is to create "positive content" during the pandemic. His team have chosen to rework a traditional song, which he says gives people courage. "It makes them feel like defenders. They're an army. Why? Because they're staying home, keeping themselves and their families safe." His playlists follow a daily rhythm. In the mornings, people want energetic pop to exercise to. By 5pm, it's time for something more reflective. "That's when the sun sets, and we play songs like this to give them hope again for tomorrow. Music is the thing here which is calming people down." 5. Par Pira (BeePee) - chosen by Okeng from Radio King in Gulu, Uganda Lockdown has made radio more crucial than ever in rural northern Uganda. Okeng's breakfast show has a feel-good feature in which the station calls up two people who want to connect with each other but lack the means (pay-as-you-go phone credit) - and it's proving popular with couples. As well as dating each other via radio, Gulu's young lovers are said to be coping with their new separation by requesting an elegant Afro-fusion love song by local artist BeePee. "The song means, 'have me in your heart during the good times, but also the bad times'," Okeng explains. 6. Quarantine Show (Dubioza Kolektiv) - chosen by Naida from Radio Antena in Sarajevo, Bosnia & Herzegovina Due to increased pressure on the internet, some of us are glad to just Skype a friend without having issues. But, miraculously, the seven members of Dubioza Kolektiv manage to use video-calling to jam out songs even while each musician stays at home. Radio Antena likes to play the best bits from these live sessions. "Wash your hands!" urges this eccentric (but informative) tune. Antena's mostly English-language playlist rarely gets more Balkan than the odd Dua Lipa track. But presenter Naida says the coronavirus has raised demand for Bosnian artists. "People are listening to us all over the world. A lot of people left here during the [1992-95] war. Right now, they're missing home. They want to hear their language, and to know what's happening here." 7. Resistiré 2020 (David Bisbal, Vanesa Martín, Alex Ubago, and others) - chosen by Valeria from Metropolis FM in Montevideo, Uruguay Recorded back in 1988, Resistiré has re-emerged as a defiant hymn, belted out from apartment balconies in virus-hit Spain. "It's different to a song like [Gloria Gaynor's] I Will Survive," says Valeria at Metropolis FM. "It's not about saying, 'I made it'. Instead it's about saying, 'I will fight this'." A star-studded 2020 cover version has become her most requested song. Uruguay has not yet been badly hit by Covid-19, Valeria says, but people here are watching the rest of the world anxiously. "A lot of them have relatives in Spain. Or they're terribly worried about family in the United States." 8. Ride Natty Ride (Bob Marley) - chosen by Maya from Capital Radio in Khartoum, Sudan "The stone that the builder refuse / Shall be the head cornerstone." Maya loves these Bob Marley lyrics. She thinks they mean that every underdog will have its day. Protesters calling for political changes in Sudan in 2019 adopted the reggae icon as something of a "freedom symbol", and he remains popular with young artists and activists a year later. Many Sudanese continue to feel marginalised, Maya says. But now it's as a result of coronavirus restrictions, which could hit the country's poorest. So, she keeps playing Marley, "no longer as a revolutionary voice, but as a calming father figure who says, 'you're going to get through this'". 9. We Will Rock You (Queen) - chosen by Moustafa from Radio One in Baghdad, Iraq "It's our anthem," says Moustafa of this 70s floor-stomper. "Any time we face a challenge at the radio station, we have a saying: 'We will rock this; this is not a problem for us.' And the same thing goes for the listeners. Whenever they're feeling down, they always request We Will Rock You." For Moustafa, lockdown is further proof of how radio offers young Iraqis an escape from their daily struggles. Turns out it's therapeutic for the DJ, too. "Just as listeners tell me their problems, I tell them mine. So, it's back and forth, which is awesome." 10. Rumah Kita (God Bless) - chosen by Hisa from Smart FM in Jakarta, Indonesia Translated as Our Home, this karaoke-ready tune has taken on a new meaning at Jakarta's Smart FM. Presenter Hisa is playing it for people who are ignoring social distancing restrictions. "We want to invite them to stay at home and be observant of the rules," she explains. "The song's message is all about how great Indonesia is: no matter where you go in the world, it's always more comfortable here. And, right now, it's best to stay not just in Indonesia, but in our homes." No official video available.
In both the photos, taken by his mother the Duchess of Cambridge, the future king flashes a gap-toothed smile at the camera. She photographed her son earlier this month and the pictures are likely to have been taken at their Norfolk home. Kensington Palace said Prince William and Catherine were "delighted" to share the photos. In one of the pictures, George is dressed in a dark green polo shirt and in the other he stands side-on, dressed more casually in a T-shirt with a camouflage design. The prince is the great-grandchild of the Queen. He will be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the crown of England in 1066 if, as is expected, he follows on as king from his grandfather, the Prince of Wales, and then his father, the Duke of Cambridge. Prince George was pictured several times during the coronavirus lockdown with his younger siblings, five-year-old Princess Charlotte and two-year-old Prince Louis, as they applauded heath and care workers during the weekly Clap for Carers. Prince George Alexander Louis - known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge - was born on 22 July 2013. He was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in central London and appeared in front of the world's media one day later, when Prince William and Catherine stood cradling him on the hospital steps. Earlier this year, the duke and duchess spoke about home-schooling George and his brother and sister while schools closed to most pupils during lockdown. "The children have got such stamina I don't know how," Catherine told the BBC. "You pitch a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake. You get to the end of the day and they have had a lovely time - but it is amazing how much you can cram into one day, that's for sure."
By Philippa FogartyBBC News Princess Mako, 25, will lose her title and leave the cloistered imperial household to live with her husband in the outside world. She will receive a one-off payment, after which the couple will be expected to provide for themselves. She will vote and pay tax, shop and do her own chores. If the couple have children, they will not be royal. But her departure means one fewer to carry out official duties. It is also reigniting debate about the shrinking monarchy, the role women play in it and future succession. Emperor Akihito, 83, has already indicated that he wants to step down. As the female royals get married, the monarchy is expected to contract further. There is only one boy among the younger royals, 10-year-old Prince Hisahito. If nothing changes, the future of the imperial institution will rest solely with him. "If you think about it there is a possibility that all but Prince Hisahito will leave the royal household in 10 to 15 years time," said Isao Tokoro, professor emeritus at Kyoto Sangyo University. "I think it [the engagement] gave us an opportunity to think about the problem. The system should be reformed urgently so we don't lose more members from the Imperial family." 'Cheerful home' Under Japan's Imperial Household Law of 1947, princesses who marry commoners are removed from the royal family. That same law slashed the number of Japanese royals, removing 11 out of 12 branches of the imperial family as a cost-cutting measure. That means there are no royal males for current princesses to marry. Japan's imperial family Japan 'considering 2018 abdication date' Ten things about Japan's emperor Emperor Hirohito's daughters lost their titles under the legislation, as did the current crown prince's sister, Sayako, when she married urban planner Yoshiki Kuroda in 2005. Her transition from closeted princess to commoner attracted considerable attention. Reports described how she learned to drive and practised shopping independently ahead of her wedding. The couple used her lump-sum payment (reportedly $1.3m; £1m) to buy a house and she is now a high priestess of the Ise Grand Shrine. So far Princess Mako's engagement has not been officially announced. But the young woman seems well-equipped for her new status, with two spells of independent living under her belt. While studying at Tokyo's International Christian University, she spent nine months as an exchange student at Edinburgh University in 2012-13. A year later, she lived in halls of residence at Leicester University as she completed her Master's in Art Museum and Gallery Studies. She is currently a researcher at a museum in Tokyo and is studying for her doctorate. "Princess Mako has been the embodiment of an Imperial family member who is close to the public," the Yomiuri newspaper said in an editorial. "Being an amiable person, she will surely build a cheerful home." 'Unbroken line' But she will be missed. According to the Asahi newspaper, Princess Mako is currently patron of two organisations, has travelled overseas as a representative of the royal family and has attended important imperial functions. Her official duties must now be shared among a dwindling pool of royals. At the moment there are 19 members of the royal family. Seven are unmarried women who must leave when they wed. Eleven (four couples and three widows) are over 50. That leaves Prince Hisahito. He is the youngest of four males in line to the throne. Three of them - Crown Prince Naruhito, his brother Prince Akishino (Fumihito) and Prince Hitachi (Masahito), the current emperor's younger brother, are highly unlikely to have more children. That could potentially leave Prince Hisahito (and whatever family he might go on to have) with sole responsibility for performing official duties and continuing the imperial line. At the moment, a law allowing Emperor Akihito to abdicate is being prepared. In its editorial, the Yomiuri newspaper said the "creation of female imperial branches should be incorporated" into the law and discussed as a "realistic measure for maintaining the number of Imperial family members". But that is unlikely to go down well with Japanese conservatives. "This is all rooted in the concept of the unbroken male blood line - the notion that what makes Japan special is that it has an imperial line that has been passed down through a male lineage, if you believe the mythical version, ever since the Emperor Jimmu in 660 BC," says Professor Ken Ruoff, director of the Centre for Japanese Studies at Portland State University and an expert on the Japanese monarchy. "This is what the nationalists seize upon and they actually will say things like if the male bloodline is broken, then Japan ceases to exist," he says. "Female blood doesn't count." Japan has had female rulers in the past, though not for about 250 years. In general they were seen as place-holders until the throne reverted to a male member of the family (though there was one case of an empress passing the throne to her daughter to act as regent for a male heir). Before the 1947 legal change, the royal family was much bigger, meaning that if one branch could not produce a male heir there were options elsewhere, but that is no longer the case. In the period before Prince Hisahito was born, when there was no younger-generation heir, there was considerable debate about changing the law to allow women on the throne. The prime minister of the day, Junichiro Koizumi, said he backed the move. But after Prince Hisahito's birth, discussions stalled. Japan's current leader, Shinzo Abe, is a more right-wing figure whose speaks often of national pride, tradition and patriotism. "Prime Minister Abe has spent a lot of time talking about his desire to make Japan a society that shines for women but he's got this far-right faction that absolutely opposes changing the law to allow a woman to sit on the throne," says Prof Ruoff. One other idea is restoring royal status to branches that lost it in 1947, providing more male heirs. Mr Abe, the Yomiuri said, backed this in the past. "It is hard to say the idea has won broad support," the paper pointed out. But there is public support for allowing women to inherit the throne. According to a Kyodo News survey in early May, 86% supported allowing a woman emperor and 59% supported allowing an emperor from the female blood-line. This potentially leaves the government out of step with popular sentiment. Whatever happens, the future looks bright for Princess Mako. Of more concern, perhaps, is whether a 10-year-old boy has broad enough shoulders to carry the Japanese monarchy onwards. Additional reporting: Chika Nakayama
The state of emergency gives security forces more powers and limits the right of public assembly. Authorities had already tightened security, deploying more than 1,400 armed officers at hotels and beaches. Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi said in a national address that "exceptional measures" were needed. "In order to face up to this scourge we need to be prepared. We need to have enough troops, proper training and material means - we are in desperate need of material means," he said, appealing for international counter-terrorism support and co-operation. The state of emergency will be in place for a renewable period of 30 days. An official from the prime minister's office said several officials had been sacked in the wake of the attack, including the governor of Sousse. "Just as there have been security failures, there have also been political failures," Dhafer Neji told AFP. Security forces were criticised for not responding more quickly to the attack on 26 June in Sousse, when a gunman opened fire on tourists on a beach and in a hotel before being shot dead by police. Those killed included 30 Britons. The gunman has been identified as student Seifeddine Rezgui, who authorities say had trained in Libya. Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid conceded in a BBC interview on Friday that the slow response of the police was a key problem. He said Rezgui had probably trained with the Ansar al-Sharia group, though Islamic State (IS) earlier said it was behind the attack. Eight people have been arrested on suspicion of collaborating with Rezgui, and the government says it has uncovered the network behind the Sousse attack. Authorities have also pledged to close some 80 mosques that were operating outside government control and accused of spreading extremism. Analysts say Tunisia has been put at risk by the chaotic situation in neighbouring Libya, and by the danger posed by Tunisians who have gone to fight in Syria and Iraq returning home. In his speech on Saturday, Mr Essebsi spoke in general terms about the threat posed by Libya. He also spoke at length about the economic and social challenges facing the country, including high unemployment and poverty in the country's interior. Tunisian security forces had responded to security challenges "gradually", he said, "because we did not have the culture of terrorism in Tunisia". The last time Tunisia declared a state of emergency was in 2011, in the uprising which overthrew President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali. It was lifted in March 2014. Officials are expected to pass a counter-terrorism bill that has been in parliament since early 2014 in the coming weeks. The Sousse attack represented the second blow in three months to Tunisia's tourism industry, an important sector for the country. In March, two gunmen killed 22 people at the renowned Bardo museum in Tunisia's capital, Tunis. Background and analysis
It will launch as a two-seater convertible with petrol engines made at Jaguar's Castle Bromwich plant with the design to be unveiled this year, the carmaker said. As the iconic E-type was last made in 1975, Jaguar said it had been "absent for too long" from making sports cars. The car will go on sale in mid-2013. Jaguar has previously described it as "the spiritual successor to the E-type", which had its debut more than 50 years ago. "The C-type, D-type and E-type Jaguars were all sports cars that held true to this principle in their era, and the F-type will hold true to that same principle in its time, a time that is soon to arrive," said Ian Callum, Jaguar's director of design. The design will be basedon the C-X16 conceptthat it unveiled in September 2011. "The reaction to it has been so positive that we've accelerated our development of an all-new Jaguar sports car," the carmaker said. The C-X16 can accelerate from zero to 62mph in 4.4 seconds, yet emit just 165g/km of CO2, Jaguar said at the time. That concept car was also fitted with a Kers system, short for Kinetic Energy Recovery System, that has been developed by the Formula 1 industry. The system allows a 1.6kWh lithium-ion battery pack, mounted behind the seats for weight distribution reasons, to be charged through a rear axle electro-hydraulic brake energy regeneration system. Investment plan Jaguar's new sports car is part of a £5bn investment plan, announced by Jaguar Land Rover last year to launch 40 "significant new products" over the next five years. Last May, Jaguar unveiled plans to build a £700,000 petrol-electric hybrid supercar in the UK in partnership with Williams F1. Jaguar had previously tried to re-launch the F-type while under ownership of US carmaker Ford, but that car was never launched. By the time it rolls off the plant, it will join Jaguar's range of other cars - the XF saloon and Sportbrake, the XJ saloon and the XK coupe and convertible. The carmaker said last month that it would create 1,000 new jobs at its Halewood factory on Merseyside to meet strong demand for its Range Rover Evoque and Freelander 2. Jaguar and Land Rover are now owned by Indian firm Tata Motors. Separately, Ford raised its forecast for auto sales this year in the US on improving consumer confidence. The company now expects full-year US sales in the range of 14.5 million to 15 million, up from the 13.5 million to 14.5 million it had predicted earlier.
Steven Weber and his girlfriend, Kenesha Antoine, were staying in a submerged cabin at the Manta Resort, off Pemba Island. Footage shows Mr Weber diving under water to ask Ms Antoine to marry him. In the video, Mr Weber presses a hand-written proposal note against the cabin window as Ms Antoine films from inside. Ms Antoine, confirming Mr Weber's death in a Facebook post, said he "never emerged from those depths". The Manta Resort told the BBC Mr Weber "tragically drowned while free diving alone outside the underwater room" on Thursday afternoon. "It is with the deepest regret that we inform that a fatal accident occurred at The Manta Resort on Thursday 19 September, 2019," the resort said in a statement. Matthew Saus, CEO of the resort, said "everyone is shaken to the core" by Mr Weber's death. Mr Weber and Ms Antoine had booked four nights at the resort's underwater room, which lies approximately 250m (820ft) from the shore. Costing $1,700-a-night (£1,300), the cabin is anchored in water around 10m (32ft) deep. On the third day of their stay, Mr Weber, from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, plunged into the water to make his proposal. Wearing a mask and fins, he held a note against the cabin's glass window as Ms Antoine watched on from within. His note read: "I can't hold my breath long enough to tell you everything I love about you. But… everything I love about you, I love more every day!" Later in the video, Mr Weber turns over the sheet of paper to reveal the proposal, before pulling an engagement ring from his shorts and swimming out of view. Mr Saus told the BBC his staff responded to a "problem in the water", but when they arrived "absolutely nothing could be done". In her Facebook post, Ms Antoine said Mr Weber "never got to hear her answer" to his proposal, which would have been "a million times, yes". "We never got to embrace and celebrate the beginning of the rest of our lives together, as the best day of our lives turned into the worst, in the cruellest twist of fate imaginable," she wrote. "I will try to take solace in the fact that we enjoyed the most amazing bucket list experiences these past few days, and that we both were so happy and absolutely giddy with excitement in our final moments together." The US Department of State said it is aware of the death of a US citizen in Tanzania, in East Africa. "We offer our sincerest condolences to the family on their loss," a spokesperson said. "We stand ready to provide all appropriate consular assistance."
Ren Zhengfei described the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer, as politically motivated. The US is pursuing criminal charges against Huawei and Ms Meng, including money laundering, bank fraud and stealing trade secrets. Huawei denies any wrongdoing. Mr Ren spoke to the BBC's Karishma Vaswani in his first international broadcast interview since Ms Meng was arrested - and dismissed the pressure from the US. "There's no way the US can crush us," he said. "The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit." However, he acknowledged that the potential loss of custom could have a significant impact. What else did Mr Ren say about the US? Last week, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned the country's allies against using Huawei technology, saying it would make it more difficult for Washington to "partner alongside them". Australia, New Zealand, and the US have already banned or blocked Huawei from supplying equipment for their future 5G mobile broadband networks, while Canada is reviewing whether the company's products present a serious security threat. Mr Ren warned that "the world cannot leave us because we are more advanced". "If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine. And if the North goes dark, there is still the South. America doesn't represent the world. America only represents a portion of the world." What did Mr Ren say about investment in the UK? The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has decided that any risk posed by using Huawei technology in UK telecoms projects can be managed. Many of the UK's mobile companies, including Vodafone, EE and Three, are working with Huawei to develop their 5G networks. They are awaiting a government review, due in March or April, that will decide whether they can use Huawei technology. Commenting on the possibility of a UK ban, Mr Ren said Huawei "won't withdraw our investment because of this. We will continue to invest in the UK. "We still trust in the UK, and we hope that the UK will trust us even more. "We will invest even more in the UK. Because if the US doesn't trust us, then we will shift our investment from the US to the UK on an even bigger scale." What does Mr Ren think about his daughter's arrest? Mr Ren's daughter Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer, was arrested on 1 December in Vancouver at the request of the US, and is expected to be the subject of a formal extradition request. In total, 23 charges are levelled against Huawei and Ms Weng. The charges are split across two indictments by the US Department of Justice. The first covers claims Huawei hid business links to Iran - which is subject to US trade sanctions. The second includes the charge of attempted theft of trade secrets. Mr Ren was clear in his opposition to the US accusations. "Firstly, I object to what the US has done. This kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable. "The US likes to sanction others, whenever there's an issue, they'll use such combative methods. "We object to this. But now that we've gone down this path, we'll let the courts settle it." What did Mr Ren say about Chinese government spying? Huawei, which is China's largest private company, has been under scrutiny for its links to the Chinese government - with the US and others expressing concern its technology could be used by China's security services to spy. Under Chinese law, firms are compelled to "support, co-operate with and collaborate in national intelligence work". But Mr Ren said that allowing spying was a risk he wouldn't take. "The Chinese government has already clearly said that it won't install any backdoors. And we won't install backdoors either. "We're not going to risk the disgust of our country and of our customers all over the world, because of something like this. "Our company will never undertake any spying activities. If we have any such actions, then I'll shut the company down." Is Huawei part of the Chinese state? Analysis - Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent - Shenzhen For a man known as reclusive and secretive, Ren Zhengfei seemed confident in the conviction that the business he's built for the last 30 years can withstand the scrutiny from Western governments. Mr Ren is right: the US makes up only a fraction of his overall business. But where I saw his mood change was when I asked him about his links to the Chinese military and the government. While he answered all of my questions, he refused to be drawn into a conversation on this, only to say that these were not facts, simply allegations - and insisted that political connections are not what has led Huawei to be successful today. When I put to him the reports that his former chairwoman, Sun Yafang, had once worked with China's Ministry of State Security, he told me that her profile was up on the company's corporate website and that he didn't think it was "OK to suspect or guess where this person used to be". He also confirmed that there is a Communist Party committee in Huawei, but he said this is what all companies - foreign or domestic - operating in China must have in order to abide by the law.

By David MolloyBBC News Despite their differences, each man has been labelled a populist. Populism is on the rise - especially among Europe's right, and in the US, where it helped crown Mr Trump. Italy's populist Five Star Movement and anti-immigrant League parties have emerged as two major players in the latest elections - the most recent of several such results in Europe. But there's a difference between being popular and being populist. The pure people In political science, populism is the idea that society is separated into two groups at odds with one another - "the pure people" and "the corrupt elite", according to Cas Mudde, author of Populism: A Very Short Introduction. The term is often used as a kind of shorthand political insult. Britain's Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has been accused of populism over his party's slogan "for the many, not the few" - but that's not quite the same thing. The word "is generally misused, especially in a European context," according to Benjamin Moffitt, author of The Global Rise of Populism. The true populist leader claims to represent the unified "will of the people". He stands in opposition to an enemy, often embodied by the current system - aiming to "drain the swamp" or tackle the "liberal elite". "It generally attaches itself to the right in a European context… but that's not an iron rule," Dr Moffitt said. Rise of the Right Populist parties can be anywhere on the political spectrum. In Latin America, there was Venezuela's late President Chávez. In Spain, there is the Podemos party, and in Greece the label has also been applied to Syriza. All these are on the left. But "most successful populists today are on the right, particularly the radical right," Prof Mudde said. Politicians "like Marine Le Pen in France, Viktor Orbán in Hungary, and Donald Trump in the US, combine populism with [anti-immigrant] nativism and authoritarianism," he added. Commentators - from Time magazine to the President of the European Commission - have been warning about the rise of right-wing populism for years. But in reality, it's nothing new. "Political scientists have been catching on to this for the last 25-30 years," Dr Moffitt says - but admits "there's been an acceleration." Experts point to both societal changes like multiculturalism and globalism, and more concrete crises as behind the rise of populist parties in Europe. Martin Bull, Director of the European Consortium of Political Research (ECPR), says the emergence of populist parties in Europe could be seen in the early 2000s - but they remained small for several years. The swell in support seemed to happen "from 2008 - and particularly in 2011, when the banking crisis turned into a sovereign debt crisis", he said. It was a rare occasion when an elite class - the wealthy bankers - could be identified as more or less directly responsible for a crisis which affected the majority of society. 'I am the people' In his book The Global Rise of Populism, Dr Moffitt argues that there are other traits associated with the typical populist leader. One is "bad manners", or behaving in a way that's not typical of politicians - a tactic employed by President Trump and the Philippines' President Duterte. The other, he says, is "perpetuating a state of crisis" - and always seeming to be on the offensive. "A populist leader who gets into power is 'forced' to be in a permanent campaign to convince his people that he is not establishment - and never will be," according to Prof Nadia Urbinati from Columbia University. She argues that populist content is "made of negatives" - whether it is anti-politics, anti-intellectualism, or anti-elite. Here lies one of the populism's strengths - it is versatile. It is "extraordinarily powerful because it can adapt to all situations," she said. Another common thread among populist leaders is they tend to dislike the "complicated democratic systems" of modern government - preferring direct democracy like referendums instead, according to Prof Bull. That also ties in to its links to authoritarianism, he argues - a lack of trust in the established system gives rise to "strongman" leaders. "Ultimately, the leader makes the decision in a way that just isn't possible in traditional democracies," he says. That sentiment is perhaps best embodied by the late left-wing Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, who once said: "I am not an individual - I am the people". Such thinking "can lead to people thinking they're infallible," Dr Moffitt said. "It restructures the political space in a new and scary way". After all, if you're not with "the people" - then you must be against us. That is why populist leaders are often viewed with suspicion - and why the term is often used as a type of insult for a politician who promises too much. It's what Prof Bull says is called "irresponsible bidding". "In order to garner support, they're quicker than the establishment party to make offers, or to promise to change things… that on closer inspection may not turn out to be feasible," he said. "You might question how good that is for democracy," he added.
The star, who shot to fame after appearing on Britain's Got Talent in 2009, had spent years believing she suffered slight brain damage at birth. In an interview with The Observer newspaper she told of her relief at finally getting a "clearer understanding" of her condition. But she vowed: "It will not make any difference to my life." Asperger's is a form of autism which typically means people with the condition struggle with their emotions and have difficulty in social situations, often unable to pick up on non-verbal cues. 'Greater understanding' Boyle, 52, revealed she was misdiagnosed after complications at birth. She said: "It was the wrong diagnosis when I was a kid. "I was told I had brain damage. I always knew it was an unfair label. Now I have a clearer understanding of what's wrong and I feel relieved and a bit more relaxed about myself." The singer has gone on to become one of the best-selling British female artists and recently had a cameo role in the festive film The Christmas Candle. Last year a musical based on her life toured cities in the UK and Republic of Ireland and she has also said a film about her rise to fame is being planned. Boyle said of her recently diagnosed condition: "It will not make any difference to my life. It's just a condition that I have to live with and work through. "I think people will treat me better because they will have a much greater understanding of who I am and why I do the things I do."
They say two women were also freed in an operation involving police forces in 11 provinces of the country. The traffickers are believed to have targeted children in the south-western Yunnan and Sichuan provinces and then sold them in other regions. Child-trafficking has become a serious problem in China, correspondents say. Critics blame the country's one-child policy and lax adoption laws, which they say have created a thriving underground market for buying children. Some families buy trafficked women and children to use as extra labour and household servants, as well as brides for unmarried sons. Last year, more than 24,000 abducted women and children were freed in China, according to the public security ministry. It said that some of those kidnapped had been sold for adoption or forced into prostitution. Greater freedom of movement as a result of China's economic reforms is thought to have made it easier for trafficking gangs to operate.
She was discussing their treatment of Britain's ambassador to China with a senior police officer at a Buckingham Palace garden party on Tuesday. It came after David Cameron was overheard saying Afghanistan and Nigeria were "fantastically corrupt". Buckingham Palace said the Chinese visit had been "extremely successful". Chinese officials in both London and Beijing also recalled the visit's "success". The invitation to President Xi was part of the government's policy of courting Chinese investment. The Queen's remarks were filmed as she was introduced to Metropolitan Police Commander Lucy D'Orsi, who the monarch is told had overseen security during President Xi's visit to the UK in October. She is heard to respond: "Oh, bad luck." 'Extraordinary' An official went on to tell the Queen that Commander D'Orsi had been "seriously, seriously undermined by the Chinese, but she managed to hold her own and remain in command". Commander D'Orsi told the Queen: "I was the Gold Commander so I'm not sure whether you knew, but it was quite a testing time for..." "I did," the Queen said. Commander D'Orsi continued: "It was at the point they walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off, that I felt..." The Queen said: "They were very rude to the ambassador." Commander D'Orsi replied: "They were... it was very rude and undiplomatic I thought." The Queen described it as "extraordinary". A Buckingham Palace spokesman later said: "We do not comment on the Queen's private conversations. "However, the Chinese State Visit was extremely successful and all parties worked closely to ensure it proceeded smoothly." Royal garden parties are filmed by the cameraman who covers the palace for UK broadcasters. Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said that "at times it got a bit stressful on both sides" but that state visits were big logistical challenges. At the palace, Ms D'Orsi told reporters it had been "rewarding" to be thanked by the Queen for her work during the state visit. She said the Queen and her own mother had chatted about the benefits of being grandmothers. A Metropolitan Police spokesman has said it was not prepared to discuss a private conversation. Reports censored In Beijing, a government spokesperson described the trip as very successful, starting a "Golden Era" of relations. Asked several times if that era continued today he neither confirmed nor denied it. The Chinese Embassy in London said both sides at "the working level" had made great efforts towards the visit's success. At the time of the visit, the Queen hailed it as a "milestone" and declared Anglo-Chinese ties were being taken to "ambitious" new heights. President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan were honoured with a state banquet at Buckingham Palace, hosted by the Queen. Analysis By Peter Hunt, BBC royal correspondent Last year, the official talk was of a trade focused state visit ushering in a "golden time" for relations between the two countries. We now know, thanks to a conversation in the Queen's palace garden, that it was a testing time behind the scenes. Blunt talking, in public, is normally the preserve of the Queen's husband. In the 80s, Prince Philip warned some British students in China that they'd get "slitty eyes" if they stayed there too long. And Prince Charles - who's avoided two Chinese state banquets in the UK - described some officials in a leaked journal as "appalling old waxworks". Buckingham Palace - while not commenting on what they call a private conversation - have stressed all parties worked closely to ensure an extremely successful Chinese state visit proceeded smoothly. Reports blocked Coverage of the comments has been censored in China where a report on BBC World News was blanked out. Instead, state media outlets have dedicated their coverage to the Queen's dress sense and notable party attendees. Social media users have been keen to comment, but many appear to have had their posts removed by online censors. Some managed to bypass filters by using English rather than Chinese to repeat the Queen's comments. 'Spurious claims' The Queen has largely avoided making political statements in her 64-year reign but it is not the first time her comments on controversial areas have been reported. In the build-up to Scotland's 2014 referendum on independence, Buckingham Palace denied suggestions that the Queen would wish to influence the result, following reports that she was concerned. Shortly before the vote she was heard saying she hoped people would "think very carefully about the future". And in March this year, there were claims by the Sun newspaper that the Queen told former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in 2011 she was in favour of the UK leaving the European Union. Buckingham Palace said it would not comment on "spurious" claims and complained to the press watchdog, while Mr Clegg called the story "nonsense". Earlier on Tuesday, the prime minister was filmed at a Buckingham Palace event to mark the Queen's 90th birthday also making unguarded comments. Talking about this week's anti-corruption summit in London, he said: "We've got some leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries coming to Britain. Nigeria and Afghanistan, possibly the two most corrupt countries in the world." The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby intervened to say: "But this particular president is not corrupt. He's trying very hard." before Speaker John Bercow said: "They are coming at their own expense, one assumes?" BBC political correspondent James Landale said the prime minister's remarks were outspoken, unguarded and ostensibly embarrassing, but they were not untrue. In Transparency International's 2015 corruption perception index, Afghanistan was ranked at 167, ahead of only Somalia and North Korea, Nigeria was at 136. 'Unfair characterisation' With his remark, the archbishop was believed to have been referring to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari, who won elections last year promising to fight widespread corruption. Mr Buhari said he was "shocked" by the prime minister's comments, while a senior Afghan official said the characterisation was "unfair". No 10 said the presidents of Nigeria and Afghanistan had "acknowledged the scale of the corruption challenge they face in their countries".
By Chi Chi IzunduNewsbeat entertainment reporter The 71-year-old told the Daily Telegraph he could return for a fifth instalment. The news came ahead of the Twitter announcement from Sylvester Stallone that Ford would be joining The Expendables 3. The last film in the franchise, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, was released in 2008. It is estimated the movie, directed by Steven Spielberg, was produced for $185 million (£120m) but took more than $786m (£510m) at the worldwide box office. It starred Shia LaBeouf and Cate Blanchett and was co-written by director George Lucas. Talking about his return as Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford said: "We've seen the character develop and grow over a period of time and it's perfectly appropriate and okay for him to come back again with a great movie around him where he doesn't necessarily have to kick as much ass. "To me, what was interesting about the character was that he prevailed, that he had courage, that he had wit, that he had intelligence, that he was frightened and that he still managed to survive. That I can do." Ford will be starring in a number of films, including the thriller Paranoia and the sci-fi movie Ender's Game. Filming for The Expendables 3 is due to start this month. Stallone tweeted: "Willis out... Harrison Ford in!!!! Great news!!!!! Been waiting years for this!!!! Greedy and lazy ...... A sure formula for career failure." Jackie Chan and Nicolas Cage are due to appear in the film, which is expected to hit cinemas in 2014. Follow @BBCNewsbeat on Twitter
What are the Panama Papers? The files show how Mossack Fonseca clients were able to launder money, dodge sanctions and avoid tax. In one case, the company offered an American millionaire fake ownership records to hide money from the authorities. This is in direct breach of international regulations designed to stop money laundering and tax evasion. It is the biggest leak in history, dwarfing the data released by the Wikileaks organisation in 2010. For context, if the amount of data released by Wikileaks was equivalent to the population of San Francisco, the amount of data released in the Panama Papers is the equivalent to that of India. You can find our special report on the revelations here. Who is in the papers? There are links to 12 current or former heads of state and government in the data, including dictators accused of looting their own countries. More than 60 relatives and associates of heads of state and other politicians are also implicated. The files also reveal a suspected billion-dollar money laundering ring involving close associates of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin. Also mentioned are the brother-in-law of China's President Xi Jinping; Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko; Argentina President Mauricio Macri; the late father of UK Prime Minister David Cameron and three of the four children of Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. The documents show that Iceland's Prime Minister, Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson, had an undeclared interest linked to his wife's wealth. He has now resigned. The scandal also touches football's world governing body, Fifa. Part of the documents suggest that a key member of Fifa's ethics committee, Uruguayan lawyer Juan Pedro Damiani, and his firm provided legal assistance for at least seven offshore companies linked to a former Fifa vice-president arrested last May as part of the US inquiry into football corruption. The leak has also revealed that more than 500 banks, including their subsidiaries and branches, registered nearly 15,600 shell companies with Mossack Fonseca. Lenders have denied allegations that they are helping clients to avoid tax by using complicated offshore arrangements. How do tax havens work? Although there are legitimate ways of using tax havens, most of what has been going on is about hiding the true owners of money, the origin of the money and avoiding paying tax on the money. You can read more on how tax havens work here. Some of the main allegations centre on the creation of shell companies, that have the outward appearance of being legitimate businesses, but are just empty shells. They do nothing but manage money, while hiding who owns it. One of the media partners involved in the investigation, McClatchy, has more on how shell companies work in this video. What do those involved have to say? Mossack Fonseca says it has operated beyond reproach for 40 years and never been accused or charged with criminal wrong-doing. Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the reports were down to "journalists and members of other organisations actively trying to discredit Putin and this country's leadership". Publication of the leaks may be down to "former employees of the State Department, the CIA, other security services," he said. In an interview with a Swedish television channel, Mr Gunnlaugsson said his business affairs were above board and broke off the interview. Fifa said it is now investigating Mr Damiani, who told Reuters on Sunday that he broke off relations with the Fifa member under investigation as soon as the latter had been accused of corruption. Who leaked the Panama Papers? The 11.5m documents were obtained by the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). The ICIJ then worked with journalists from 107 media organisations in 76 countries, including UK newspaper the Guardian, to analyse the documents over a year. The BBC does not know the identity of the source but the firm says it has been the victim of a hack from servers based abroad. In all, the details of 214,000 entities, including companies, trusts and foundations, were leaked. The information in the documents dates back to 1977, and goes up to December last year. Emails make up the largest type of document leaked, but images of contracts and passports were also released. How can I read the papers? So far, a searchable archive is not available at the moment. There is a huge amount of data, and much of it reportedly includes personal information (including passport details), and does not necessarily include those suspected of criminal activity. Having said that, there is plenty of information out there. The ICIJ has put together a comprehensive list of the main figures implicated here - you can also search by country.

They entered what is known as the Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ), but did not enter US air space. The planes, two of which were MiG 31 jets, left the area without incident. Officials said this type of incident was not uncommon, and happens up to 10 times a year. The ADIZ is a zone of airspace which extends out approximately 200 miles from the coastline and is mainly within international airspace. US sovereign air space extends 12 nautical miles from land. Two Alaskan-based F-22 fighter jets and two Canadian CF-18 fighter jets were scrambled to intercept the Russian planes in two separate incidents on Wednesday evening and Thursday morning. Also on Wednesday, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said two Russian military aircraft had crossed into Swedish air space south of the Baltic Sea island of Oland. The ministry called it a "serious violation". Sweden has said it has summoned the Russian ambassador over the incident.
Satellite images show the extent of the storm as it approached the Philippines on 7 November. At times it stretched 600km (372 miles) across. If the same storm was placed over a map of Europe it would stretch from London to Berlin. How Super Typhoon Haiyan would stretch if placed over Northern Europe Super Typhoon Haiyan is the 25th tropical storm to enter Philippine territory this year and reports suggest there have been sustained winds of some 320 km/h (199mph) with gusts of up to 378 km/h (235mph). The "worst" storm is hard to define as such events differ in extremes of wind speeds or gusts, pressure, damage or loss of human life. Some major storms also lose their ferocity as they cross the sea and make landfall. Major storms in the Pacific region in recent years include the Super Typhoon Megi which hit the Philippines in October 2010 before picking up again and moving on to mainland China. Damage caused by winds reaching 268 km/h (167mph) left 200,000 Filipinos homeless. But there were surprisingly few fatalities compared with the 2012 Typhoon Bopha, whose 175mph winds wreaked havoc and caused more than 1,000 deaths - or the 1999 Orissa Cyclone in India which wiped out everything in its path, leaving more than 10,000 dead and millions homeless. Hurricane Katrina, by comparison was Category 3, with winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) when it made landfall in August 2005 in the United States. Katrina's trail of destruction through the Bahamas, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama left around 1,800 people dead and caused an estimated $108bn in damage.
Prior to her detention, the Chinese-born Australian had been a TV presenter for Chinese state media outlet CGTN. Chinese authorities confirmed her arrest on Monday, adding that her legal rights would be guaranteed. Ms Cheng was detained in August and charged last Friday, Australian officials had earlier said. At a press briefing on Monday, Chinese ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said he hoped Australia would "not interfere with China's handling of this case", according to news agency Reuters. Canberra has repeatedly raised concerns with Beijing over Ms Cheng's detention. "We expect basic standards of justice, procedural fairness and humane treatment to be met, in accordance with international norms," said Australia's foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne. "Our thoughts are with Ms Cheng and her family during this difficult period." What do we know about the case? Ms Cheng had worked in Beijing for the last few years. Many of her family, including her two young children, live in Australia. In August, she suddenly disappeared from television and couldn't be contacted by friends or relatives. Her employer, CGTN - the English-language channel of the state broadcaster - also wiped its websites of Ms Cheng's profile page and work. China eventually announced she was being held on national security grounds under "residential surveillance" in an unknown location. Her family said they had no idea why she had been detained. "I don't think she would have done anything to harm national security in any way intentionally," her niece Louisa Wen told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. "We don't know if she's just been caught up in something that she herself didn't realise." Her family said Ms Cheng had been interrogated on several occasions and was being kept in a cell. Her health had deteriorated, they added. Australia said its representatives had been able to visit her once a month - in line with the bilateral consular agreement with China. What's the wider background? Relations between Australia and China have deteriorated in recent years, leading to diplomatic and trade ructions. Analysts say this has made it harder for Australian authorities to negotiate with Beijing over their citizens' release. Beijing has arrested or expelled a number of journalists in recent times. Shortly after Ms Cheng's arrest last year, the last two Australian media correspondents in China fled the country following consular advice. ABC reporter Bill Birtles said that prior to his departure, Chinese police had turned up to his apartment and questioned him about Ms Cheng, but also asked him questions on a wide range of topics. In December, China also arrested Bloomberg journalist Haze Fan, a Chinese citizen who they alleged had endangered national security. Bloomberg said it was "deeply concerned" for her well-being and had sought information on her case. It joined other international media groups in calling for her release. Another China-born Australian citizen, writer Yang Hengjun, has also been in detention in China for over two years. He denies espionage charges. Australia has said Mr Yang has endured "unacceptable" treatment during his detention, including being shackled in his cell and enduring hundreds of interrogations.
By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News A team at New York University trawled the internet to find the most common claims about a good night's kip. Then, in a study published in the journal Sleep Health, they matched the claims to the best scientific evidence. They hope that dispelling sleep myths will improve people's physical and mental health and well-being. So, how many are you guilty of? Myth 1 - You can cope on less than five hours' sleep This is the myth that just won't go away. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously had a brief four hours a night. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made similar claims, and swapping hours in bed for extra time in the office is not uncommon in tales of business or entrepreneurial success. Yet the researchers said the belief that less than five hours' shut-eye was healthy, was one of the most damaging myths to health. "We have extensive evidence to show sleeping five hours or less consistently, increases your risk greatly for adverse health consequences," said researcher Dr Rebecca Robbins. These included cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes, and shorter life expectancy. Instead, she recommends everyone should aim for a consistent seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Thatcher: Can people get by on four hours' sleep? Myth 2 - Alcohol before bed boosts your sleep The relaxing nightcap is a myth, says the team, whether it's a glass of wine, a dram of whisky or a bottle of beer. "It may help you fall asleep, but it dramatically reduces the quality of your rest that night," said Dr Robbins. It particularly disrupts your REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep, which is important for memory and learning. So yes, you will have slept and may have nodded off more easily, but some of the benefits of sleep are lost. Alcohol is also a diuretic, so you may find yourself having to deal with a full bladder in the middle of the night too. Myth 3 - Watching TV in bed helps you relax Have you ever thought "I need to wind down before bed, I'm going to watch some TV"? Well, the latest Brexit twists and turns on the BBC News at Ten might be bad for sleep. Dr Robbins argues: "Often if we're watching the television it's the nightly news… it's something that's going to cause you insomnia or stress right before bed when we're trying to power down and relax." And as for Game of Thrones, it's hard to argue the Red Wedding was relaxing. The other issue with TV - along with smartphones and tablets - is they produce blue light, which can delay the body's production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Will the light from your phone kill you? Myth 4 - If you're struggling to sleep, stay in bed You've spent so long trying to nod off you've managed to count all the sheep in New Zealand (that's about 28 million). So what should you do next? The answer is not to keep trying. "We start to associate our bed with insomnia," said Dr Robbins. "It does take the healthy sleeper about 15 minutes to fall asleep, but much longer than that… make sure to get out of bed, change the environment and do something that's mindless." Her tip - go fold some socks. Myth 5 - Hitting the snooze button Who isn't guilty of reaching for the snooze button on their phone, thinking that extra six minutes in bed is going to make all the difference? But the research team says that when the alarm goes off, we should just get up. Dr Robbins said: "Realise you will be a bit groggy - all of us are - but resist the temptation to snooze. "Your body will go back to sleep, but it will be very light, low-quality sleep." Instead the advice is to throw open the curtains and expose yourself to as much bright light as possible. Myth 6 - Snoring is always harmless Snoring can be harmless, but it can also be a sign of the disorder sleep apnoea. This causes the walls of the throat to relax and narrow during sleep, and can briefly stop people breathing. People with the condition are more likely to develop high blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat and have a heart attack or a stroke. One of the warning signs is loud snoring. NHS: Obstructive sleep apnoea Dr Robbins concludes: "Sleep is one of the most important things we can all do tonight to improve our health, our mood, our wellbeing and our longevity."

The prime minister was told it was needed because another panda, donated to London Zoo when Edward Heath was in Downing Street, had proved "highly unlikely ever to breed". The male had "proved" his fertility and a baby was wanted, an official said. Thatcher was also given a potted history of China before the trip. Cabinet Secretary Robert Armstrong jotted down a reminder that the zoo would like to have a fertile female giant panda from her visit in September 1982. A pair of the animals had been presented to Heath in 1972, but Mr Armstrong, later made a peer, noted: "Unfortunately the female is highly unlikely ever to breed." Yet the male had "proved his fertility", he wrote, adding: "London Zoo would clearly like to have a fertile female and, in due course, a baby panda." To help Thatcher improve her Chinese knowledge there was a guide that provided a briefing of China dating from "prehistory" to 1945. After the visit, during which the future of Hong Kong was discussed, the prime minister sent a letter of thanks to an embassy worker who had "kindly" lent her some "Carmen rollers" to prevent a bad hair day. The documents have been released by the National Archives at Kew under the "30-year rule", under which previously secret information is made public.
Hundreds of people were on the trains involved in Friday evening's crash just outside Bridgeport, Connecticut. Officials said a train that left New York City's Grand Central en route to New Haven, Connecticut, derailed then was hit by another train. Amtrak has suspended its service between New York and Boston. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy said on Friday night that the front of one of the trains had been extensively damaged and its wheels were "sticking into the other train". He said five people had received serious injuries, describing one person as being in a "very critical" condition. The two hospitals in Bridgeport that received the wounded said they were each treating one person in a critical condition. By Saturday morning, many of injured passengers had been released from hospital. Investigators are trying to find out what caused the crash, which happened shortly after 18:00 local time (22:00 GMT). Governor Malloy said he had no reason to believe it was anything other than an accident. Bridgeport Police Chief Joseph Gaudett said most of those hurt were walking wounded. "Everybody seemed pretty calm," he told the Associated Press. "Everybody was thankful they didn't get seriously hurt. They were anxious to get home to their families." But Canadian passenger Alex Cohen told NBC Connecticut that "people were screaming... they had to smash a window to get us out". One witness, Brian Alvarez, told CNN: "I saw this one car and it was completely destroyed and they were pulling people out of the car. They were all bloody."
By Emma AtkinsonBBC News But what is it like for women who study and work in the field? We asked women from UCL to tell us about their experiences, why they chose science and whether women really do cry in labs. Natsuko Macabuag, 31, is a PhD student at the department of Neuroscience, Pharmacology and Physiology I was hugely influenced by my teachers to study science at GCSE and A-Level. I liked biology and chemistry and so a degree in biochemistry seemed a perfect option. I really believe that any positions in science should be based on ability rather than anything else and, from my experience, biosciences have a fairly even gender balance, especially when compared to other areas like engineering for example. I haven't faced any specific discrimination but I do think it can be harder for women if they have to take time off for maternity leave. It can slow your career progression and make it harder to move up. And no, women don't go around crying in the lab. I've seen more men getting angry and frustrated than I have women crying over a stressful job. Martha Robinson, 25, is a PhD student at the Institute of Ophthalmology I've never been told that I don't belong in science but I do think women are treated differently within the sector. There are so few women at the very top and I think progression is really hard. Women's competencies are often described differently. You hear a lot of "proficient" and "good at experiments" rather then "highly intelligent and insightful", which men get and suggest someone is more professor-level. I once worked on some programming and a male professor suggested "you could make it pink". I also went to a conference that had encouraged more women to attend but many men saw it that we were only there because we were women and not because we were as good as them. I was just quite shocked about how blatant they were about saying those things to us. I also think women have a hard time challenging what their seniors say about them, as the industry is so dependent on recommendations and I don't think women feel comfortable challenging them. It can make women's aspirations more limited if they see that it is going to be much tougher for them. Shu Ho, 23, is studying for an MA in Pharmacology I went to a school that specialised in maths and science and when I started the line of boys was much longer than the line of girls. But by the time I left six years later it was much more even, so changes have happened even in a short time. There are so many career opportunities for women in science and I don't feel at this stage that anything is off limits. I've personally always enjoyed labs where there is more of a balance of men and women, as they can be much more productive and nicer environments but really I think it's much more down to personality than it is to gender. Dr Hiranya Peiris is a cosmologist and reader in astronomy I always wanted to be an astronaut when I grew up and was really into science from a young age. My parents were both civil engineers, and growing up in Sri Lanka studying physics and maths was never seen as a boys thing to do. But since then I've had very different experiences. I see girls in my groups who are much less confident than boys, even though often they are much better students. I think it's from decades of these attitudes being reinforced. It's not from outright incidences of sexism but 1,000 small cuts that all add up. After I made an appearance on the BBC's Newsnight talking about astronomy a newspaper columnist suggested I was only on the programme because I was a woman. It hadn't even crossed my mind that anyone would think that and it was so upsetting. At the moment a few exceptional and hardy women make it to the top of my field of research but a lot of women leak out of the pipeline along the way. I really believe that equality will only be reached when average women get the same opportunities that average men do. Dr Helen Wilson, 42, is an applied mathematician I always knew I wanted to do a maths degree. My school was pretty good at encouraging me and I never felt it was something I was being persuaded against, but then I've also never really felt the need to conform, so maybe that's why I just stuck with what I was determined to do. I did notice the gender difference when I got to university though. About a quarter of the people on my undergraduate degree course were female and the proportions went down and down after that, which makes you more aware you are in the minority. There are just as many career opportunities for women in this area but I wonder if the perception is very different or whether it comes down to a confidence issue among some women. I have two young children but I've always found it to be a very family friendly career. I am in a research job, so my hours are more flexible, but I know this isn't the case for women who work in lab science where it isn't always that easy. I didn't take off a huge amount of time when I had my children. Research can move on quite quickly and I was aware of that and it wasn't always easy getting back into work.
Ms Yellen, who headed the US central bank from 2014 to 2018, earlier won bipartisan support from members of the Senate Finance Committee. She will be responsible for guiding the Biden administration's economic response to the pandemic. The US is struggling to rebound economically from the hit caused by the coronavirus pandemic. At her confirmation hearing on 19 January, Ms Yellen urged Congress to approve trillions more in pandemic relief and economic stimulus, saying that lawmakers should "act big" without worrying about national debt. In response, Republican senators warned the former Federal Reserve head this was not the time for "a laundry list" of liberal reforms. Ms Yellen disagreed, highlighting the fact that many families whose incomes have fallen were not reached by jobless programmes. She argued that plans to raise taxes must be seen in the context of financing bigger investments necessary to make the US economy competitive. "The focus now is not on tax increases. It is on programmes to help us get through the pandemic," she stressed. Who is Janet Yellen? Janet Yellen was previously chair of the US Federal Reserve. She was known for focusing more attention on the impact of the central bank's policies on workers and the costs of America's rising inequality. Before then-President Barack Obama named her to lead the Fed in 2014, she had served as one of its board members for a decade, including four years as vice-chair. Donald Trump bucked Washington tradition when he opted not to appoint Ms Yellen to a second four-year term at the Fed. However, her climb to the top of the economics profession had made her a feminist icon in the economics world. When she left the Fed in 2018, many paid tribute to her leadership by imitating her signature look of a blazer with a popped collar. Ms Yellen is seen as someone able to satisfy both progressive and centrist members of Mr Biden's Democratic party. Her nomination to lead the Fed in 2014 won support from some Republicans. Her focus on employment, rather than inflation, gave her a reputation of favouring low interest rates, which spur economic activity by making it less expensive to borrow money. But under her leadership, the Fed raised interest rates for the first time since 2008 - albeit less aggressively than some more conservative commentators supported. Her stewardship of that process has won praise on Wall Street, even as it remains hotly debated.
The top 10 payments in the three years to December 2012 accounted for 20% of the total. The BBC said the savings it had made from senior manager redundancies exceeded the cost of severance pay. The BBC's director general Tony Hall said: "These payments were from another era and we are putting a stop to them." He added: "I believe the BBC lost its way on payments in recent years. I have already said that we will be capping severance payments at £150,000 and we have now begun to improve our processes." The BBC announced in April that it was consulting staff on capping redundancy payments at £150,000 or 12 months' salary, whichever is lower. The BBC also estimated that the cumulative pay bill saved from reducing senior manager numbers in the three years to December 2012 was £35m. However the National Audit Office (NAO) found that the BBC had breached "its own already generous policies on severance payments". Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said: "Weak governance arrangements have led to payments that exceeded contractual requirements and put public trust at risk." The NAO noted "decisions to award severance payments that exceed contractual entitlements have, until recently, been subject to insufficient challenge and oversight. "The BBC's proposal to cap redundancy payments, announced in 2013 by the new director general, is a signal of change for the better. It is well below the maximum that applies to civil servants." The report also noted that the number of senior managers had been reduced from 660 to 445 in the three years to December 2012. Culture Secretary Maria Miller said: "Every publicly-funded organisation must be able to justify every penny of taxpayers' money they spend, and even more so in these tough economic times. There is huge public interest in the BBC, and the NAO has exposed a culture of pay-offs that simply cannot be justified. "The report shines a light on a culture at the BBC where individuals received payments that went beyond the already very generous terms of their contract. I welcome the fact that the BBC is looking at future payments - a move which this report suggests is long overdue." A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister "very much backs the position that Maria Miller has taken on this". Former BBC director general Mark Thompson declined to comment. The NAO provided analysis of several case studies in its report, one of which was the former deputy director general Mark Byford who was paid £949,000, which included £73,000 for unused leave. Former BBC executive Roly Keating, who was paid £376,000 after 29 years service at the BBC, returned a cheque for their net severance payment. The BBC had negotiated a severance arrangement before the manager's post had been made redundant. Mr Keating, who was the BBC's director of archive content until he left last year to become chief executive of the British Library, told the NAO that they would not wish to benefit from a payment that could not be demonstrated to be fully and appropriately authorised. The prime minister's spokesman, when asked whether former BBC executives should follow the lead of Mr Keating, said: "Ultimately it is up to individuals to consider their actions. "The point the PM would want to get across is that it is really important at any time that a publicly-funded organisation is spending taxpayers' money wisely, but especially at a time when we have tough economic constraints that money is being properly spent." It is the BBC's executive board remuneration committee that takes decisions on senior pay packages but the BBC Trust has to hold the executive board to account. The NAO noted that former BBC director general George Entwistle was paid £475,000 after he announced his resignation in November 2012. This included three weeks' salary worth £25,000 that was not part of his severance package of £450,000. Mr Entwistle was entitled to a notice period of 12 months, although he was only in the job for 54 days. The BBC Trust has since agreed with Mr Hall on a reduction to his notice period from 12 to six months. The trust asked the NAO to carry out a review following public concern about the BBC's severance payments to senior managers. Anthony Fry, BBC trustee and chairman of the trust's financial committee, said: "Although the BBC has achieved significant savings in its senior manager pay bill, some of the NAO's conclusions are deeply worrying, particularly the failure to follow agreed severance policies in a number of cases as a result of weak governance from the BBC executive in the past. "Such practices are unacceptable and I have no doubt that they will, quite rightly, be met with considerable dismay by licence fee payers and staff alike." He added: "We have asked the Exec to increase the transparency of the BBC's severance payments by disclosing more information in the annual report and accounts." The BBC has also defended the creation of the new post, that of deputy head of news and current affairs, which will be filled by the current head of BBC newsgathering, Fran Unsworth. In a statement, a BBC spokeswoman said: "This is a senior role which aims to strengthen the BBC News management team. "Previously the deputy director role was carried out as part of other wider responsibilities but it was felt it is such an important role at this current time that it needs to stand alone."
By Rachel StonehouseNewsbeat The intrusive tests are considered a violation of human rights by the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations, which want to see them banned. Critics say they are unscientific, cannot prove whether someone is a virgin and can be a form of abuse. The tests involve a vaginal examination to check if the hymen is intact. The BBC investigation found a number of private clinics advertising "virginity repair" which, when contacted, then also offered the so-called virginity test for between £150 and £300. The BBC identified 21 clinics and managed to make inquiries with 16 of them, seven confirmed they offer "virginity testing" and several others would not clarify their position. All said they would carry out hymen-repair surgery, which costs in the region of £1,500 to £3,000. Data from NHS England shows 69 hymen-repair procedures have been carried out in the past five years. Newsbeat has heard the story of one woman helped by the charity Karma Nirvana, which supports victims of so-called honour-based abuse and forced marriage. "I had a very emotionally abusive relationship with my parents who wanted me to have an arranged marriage," she says. 'Running away was my only option' "One day, an elder in the community saw me out with my friends and said to my mum that one of the boys was my boyfriend. There were lots of rumours in the community about it." She was then threatened with a "virginity test" by her parents. "My parents and the family of the man they wanted me to marry said I had to have a virginity test to prove I was still a virgin so the marriage could go ahead. "I was scared and didn't really understand what it meant. I felt running away was my only option - so that's what I did." Priya Manota manages the helpline for Karma Nirvana. "We have received calls from girls who are concerned about this. It might be that they are worried their families have found out perhaps they've been in a relationship or they're not a virgin. It might be family are pressuring them to go through with tests and they are concerned about the outcome of that. "Triggers for honour-based abuse and forced marriage are being in a relationship, choosing your own partner and being in an intimate or sexual relationship. We know at the charity many victims in extreme cases have been killed. For other victims it might be they are disowned by family." Virginity testing is known to be practised in at least 20 countries, according to WHO, which says there is no evidence that it can prove whether a woman or girl has had sex or not. This is because the hymen can tear for many reasons, including tampon use and exercise. Last year, US rapper T.I. sparked outrage after admitting during a podcast he takes his daughter for a test every year to check her hymen is still intact. Tweezers and fake blood Meanwhile, the BBC has also found hymen-repair kits being sold online for £50, which claim to restore virginity. One kit purchased for £104 arrived from Germany. It contained 60ml of vagina tightening gel, plastic tweezers, a blood capsule and three sachets that appear to contain fake blood. There were no instructions on how to use the kit. Dr Ashfaq Khan is a gynaecologist who regularly gets requests from patients for virginity testing and hymen repair. "I don't understand why it is not illegal in the UK, it should be made illegal," he says. "The whole idea the absence of part of the hymen means you're not a virgin is wrong first of all. It can be torn for various reasons, and if I was to say 'it is torn, I need to repair it' and then I can give you a certificate, that means I am giving a false certificate." 'Educate our communities' He believes more action against the practice is needed. "The same way we push FGM [female genital mutilation] issues brilliantly, as world leaders highlighting the problem of FGM," he tells Newsbeat. "And to me this is another crime - and we are associating ourselves with a procedure which is ethically and morally not correct." Earlier this year, the Middle Eastern Women and Society Organisation started a campaign to ban "virginity testing", and called for more education around the topic. Founder Halaleh Taheri said: "Although we would like to eventually ban hymen repair, banning the practice without proper education will only do more harm than good. The only reason these practices are in business is because of this backward mentality concerning virginity. "If we were to help educate our communities and to reverse this belief, then there would be no need for hymen reconstruction. It would go out of business on its own."

The ceremony in Auckland brings the huge trade pact, which has been five years in the making, another step towards to becoming a reality. But the TPP continues to face opposition. The 12 nations account for some 40% of the world's economy - they now have two years to ratify or reject the pact. Australia's minister for trade Andrew Robb was the first to sign the pact. Those attending the ceremony cheered as his counterpart, New Zealand trade minister Todd McClay, added the last signature. The TPP involves the US, Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru. Those against the deal, particularly some Americans, fear it could mean jobs will move from the US to developing countries. 'Write the rules of 21st Century' However, US President Barack Obama said the agreement was a new type of trade deal "that puts American workers first". "Partnership would give the United States an advantage over other leading economies, namely China," he said in a statement on Wednesday. "TPP allows America - and not countries like China - to write the rules of the road in the 21st Century, which is especially important in a region as dynamic as the Asia-Pacific," he said. "We should get TPP done this year and give more American workers the shot at success they deserve and help more American businesses compete and win around the world." In Auckland and in the US, among other countries, protestors have voiced their anger about the trade pact over the past several months. In the lead up to Thursday's signing, the streets around Auckland's central business district were disrupted by groups blocking access to the Auckland Harbour Bridge. Police clashed with some protestors, who have widely claimed the deal will benefit big business rather than workers. Behind the deal The trade deal looks to facilitate investment between 12 countries across the Pacific Rim, which together account for about 40% of the global economy. It was agreed in October last year after years of negotiations and multiple missed deadlines. The US-led initiative is a key part of Mr Obama's so-called pivot to Asia but has proved to be a controversial issue ahead of the US elections in November. Mr Obama has barely a year left on his term and his administration warns that the US economy will suffer if politicians don't ratify the agreement. US Trade Representative Michael Froman said the deal could add $100bn (£68.5bn) a year to US growth. "After five years of negotiation, signing the TPP is an important milestone in our efforts to set high-standard rules of the road in the Asia Pacific region and more generally, and to deliver an agreement that will benefit American workers, farmers and businesses," he said.
It'll be the virtual band's only UK festival appearance this year. Albarn, who headlined Glastonbury in 2009 with Blur, says it will be a privilege to appear at the festival and they won't let anyone down. He said: "I was surprised and a bit nervous. I appreciate that it's a big deal but I think we can pull it off." U2 were forced to pull out of Glastonbury and cancel their US tour after Bono had back surgery. The singer said he was "heartbroken" at having to take the decision. 'Magic' It means Damon Albarn, 42, will be headlining his second Glastonbury in a row. But speaking on Zane Lowe's Radio 1 show, he says it will be completely different to playing with Blur. He admitted: "I'm not thinking for one second that I can compete with that kind of thing. "This is something very separate and I wouldn't try to compare the two at all. "Obviously it's a great shame for U2 that they can't do that. I know that they were really looking forward to playing that gig. They've never done Glastonbury. "It's magic, Glastonbury. It's definitely magic in so many ways." Gorillaz released their third album, Plastic Beach, in March and unveiled their new set at the Coachella Music Festival in America in April. Damon Albarn says he hopes some of the stars who appeared on the record can sing with them at Glastonbury on Friday 25 June. "I just hope we can convince Lou Reed and he grasps that it's a real privilege to get the chance to do it. "Then we'd have a complete house and that really would be amazing." Albarn also says he's never had the chance to spend any time experiencing Glastonbury as a punter. He said: "It's nice being at the beginning because [Blur] was right at the end and we had to get off stage and get in our bus and drive straight off, which was really strange. "I didn't get a chance to experience it. I'd quite like this time to be able to do my thing and hang out for a while."
By Karishma VaswaniAsia business correspondent However, he maintained that the odds of military conflict are "not yet high". The prime minister said if both nations continue to take a hard line because of domestic considerations, they could easily find themselves at an impasse. The Biden administration will hold its first high-level talks with Chinese officials in Alaska next week. Mr Lee was reluctant to give advice to China but noted its political direction had sparked tensions with nations big and small. "There is significant uncertainty [and] anxiety over which way China is going and whether this will be good for them," he told BBC World News' Talking Business Asia programme. "I do not think that is in China's interest." The Singaporean leader's views on the US-China relationship are often sought, as the tiny island nation plays an outsized role economically and in terms of political influence in the region. The US is a major security partner for the city state and is also the biggest investor in Singapore, far out-stripping any other country's contribution. Meanwhile, China is Singapore's largest export market and, like much of Asia, Singapore's economy has benefited from China's rise. US-China trade war The bitter trade war between the two superpowers over the last two years has threatened this delicate balance. It started during former US President Donald Trump's time in office, but there's been no indication that newly-elected President Joe Biden will take a softer approach with China. Prime Minister Lee said he hoped the new American leader would be someone who "believes in multilateralism and international trade". He also addressed the tussle for global dominance between the two. "The US is still number one but number two [China] is not so far behind," he said. "That is what is difficult for the US to accept." By some estimates, the Chinese economy is slated to overtake the US to become the world's largest by 2028, five years earlier than previously forecast. China's remarkable economic rise has in recent years been accompanied by increasing aggression both internally and externally under leader Xi Jinping. China's rise That has led to condemnation of its actions by many in the West and concern among some partners in Asia. Despite this, Prime Minister Lee said Singapore could not afford to take sides. "It is a problem for many countries, which is why we are all hoping and encouraging the two large powers to think very carefully before deciding that the other one is an adversary which has to be kept down, if not put down," he said. "What we would like to see is China being a country where its prosperity, development and growing strength is welcomed by other countries in the world, who see this as an opportunity for them to prosper together and live in a stable world together." The deterioration in US-China ties is taking place against the backdrop of the pandemic and a backlash against globalisation, an economic trend that has helped Singapore become one of the richest countries in Asia. Prime Minister Lee believes globalisation still has much going for it, especially given the need to cooperate on vaccines. "You cannot avoid working with one another because to go back to where you were... lies poverty and despair and probably instability and conflict," he said. Post-pandemic travel Closer to home, one of the key priorities for Singapore is to open borders and find a way for tourists to return to the trade and travel-dependent nation. The prime minister suggested vaccination passports could be part of that process but warned it would be some time before international travel returned to pre-pandemic levels. "It will not be like before where you can just buy a ticket, hop onto the plane and go off to Hong Kong, Bangkok or Bali for a weekend or a casual holiday," he said. "Hopefully by the end of this year or next year the doors can start to open, if not earlier."

By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent Prof Richard Betts from the Met Office Hadley Centre said we are "seeing a sign of what would be normal conditions under a future warming world of 3C". While natural weather patterns have driven recent fires, researchers said it's "common sense" that human-induced heating is playing a role. Last year was Australia's warmest and driest year on record. UK researchers have carried out a rapid analysis of the impact of climate change on the risk of wildfires happening all over the world. Their study looked at 57 research papers published since the last major review of climate science came out in 2013. All the studies in the review showed links between climate change and the increased frequency or severity of fire weather. This is defined as those periods of time which have a higher risk of fire due to a combination of high temperatures, low humidity, low rainfall and high winds. The signal of human-induced warming has become clearer in different parts of the world with the passage of time. A paper published last year suggests the impact of climate change could be detected outside the range of natural variability in 22% of land that's available for burning. "Overall, the 57 papers reviewed clearly show human-induced warming has already led to a global increase in the frequency and severity of fire weather, increasing the risks of wildfire," said Dr Matthew Jones, from the University of East Anglia, and the lead author of the review. "This has been seen in many regions, including the western US and Canada, southern Europe, Scandinavia and Amazonia. Human-induced warming is also increasing fire risks in other regions, including Siberia and Australia." However, the review says that the dramatic fire situation witnessed in Australia in recent months is "challenging to diagnose". Naturally occurring weather patterns have played a significant role in creating the right conditions for wildfires. Conditions in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific have meant hot, dry spells across the country. But the influence of human-driven climate change is also in the mix. "This (the fires) would have happened naturally but we can be confident that they have been made hotter because of man-made climate change," said Prof Betts. Speaking at the launch of the global review, he pointed to the fact that Australia is now about 1.4C warmer than the global average temperature was in the pre-industrial period. "Temperatures in December in Australia, that have occurred recently, they are extreme for now but they would be normal under a world getting on for three degrees of warming, so we are seeing a sign of what would be normal conditions under a future warming world of 3 degrees," Prof Betts explained. Right now, the world has warmed around 1C since the 1850s. Even with current government plans to limit emissions of CO2, the world is on course for around 3C of warming by the end of this century. Other experts involved in the review say that people are seeing the signal of global warming "with their own eyes" when it comes to wildfires and heatwaves. "These are impacts we are seeing for one degree of global climate change. The impact will get worse as long as we don't do what it takes to stabilise the world's climate," said Prof Corinne Le Quéré, from the University of East Anglia in Norwich. "And what it takes is to bring CO2 and other long-lived greenhouse gases down to net zero emissions. If we don't do it, we will have much worse impacts - so what we are seeing in Australia is not the new normal, it's a transition to worse impacts." The details of the papers included in the review can be found at the ScienceBrief online platform. Follow Matt on Twitter.
She is confident that conditions can be created for the UK to stay in and she is "not losing sleep" over it, she said in a BBC interview. UK Prime Minister David Cameron aims to renegotiate the UK's EU membership terms, ahead of an in/out referendum. "I'm optimistic that if we all want it, we'll find a good solution," she said. "It's not about losing sleep over this, but about doing our work and creating the necessary preconditions for Britain to remain in the EU." 'Different speeds' Treaty change is a thorny issue for the EU, as France and some other countries are known to be very wary of it. The Lisbon Treaty negotiation dragged on for some eight years before its signing in 2009, and involved two Irish referendums. "Some of the things that David Cameron is asking for I can support," Mrs Merkel told the BBC's Europe Editor Katya Adler in Berlin. "There are other points where we have a different opinion, but we have always been able also to pursue a Europe at different speeds, to find opt-out solutions for example." When asked whether EU treaties would be changed, she replied: "If that is really necessary then we have to consider it." Last week, the prime minister made a whistle-stop tour of Europe trying to gather support for changes he wants before holding the UK's EU membership referendum. That vote is to take place by the end of 2017. Tighter rules on migrants' benefits are a priority for the UK Conservatives, as they want to control immigration from the EU. Mr Cameron also wants an opt-out from the EU pledge of "ever closer union" and more influence for national parliaments over EU laws. Mrs Merkel was asked if she was ever irritated by UK demands in the EU. She responded with a smile and said "we know each other.... and as German chancellor I can say that I also have my own ideas of how things in the EU should be. "The EU is a union of 28 member states that have to find compromises. Only when everyone is agreed and happy can we get proper results. That will is there. We have already found many, many solutions for many, many difficult questions - it should be like that in this case too." There is speculation that the EU could come up with a special treaty protocol for the UK, to accommodate particular UK concerns. A similar procedure made Danish and Irish opt-outs legally binding in the past.
By Emily McAuliffeBusiness reporter, Melbourne, Australia "The atmosphere is usually one of enthusiasm, excitement, anticipation and curiosity," he says. If you asked people to try to picture hunting for truffles, the expensive subterranean fungi, many would no doubt imagine men with dogs going through woodlands in France or Italy. Given that truffles have been harvested in both countries for centuries, this is understandable. Yet since 1999 they have been joined by Australia, which in just 20 years has become the world's fourth-largest producer of the most-prized type of black truffle - the French black or périgord. Some in the Australian industry, such as Mr Wood, the owner of Truffle Paddock, a truffle farm in the state of Victoria, even believe that in another decade's time the country could take the number one position. While exact country-by-country figures are difficult to come by, given the secrecy that surrounds the "diamonds in the dirt", Australia is expected to harvest between 14 and 18 tonnes of French blacks this year. This compares with an estimated 60 tonnes last winter in Spain, 30 tonnes in Italy, and slightly more than Australia in France. (Industry experts say it is notoriously difficult to quantify French production figures due to a lack of data, and accusations that it imports périgords from Spain that then become "French".) What is not in doubt is that selling fresh French blacks is a very lucrative business. Much in demand in the world's finest restaurants, they can retail for up to $1,300 (£1,000) a kg. Not native to Australia, they were first introduced to the country in the mid 1990s, with the first Australian truffles unearthed in 1999. To cultivate or farm the truffles, trees - typically oak and hazelnut saplings - are replanted after their roots have been inoculated with the fungus' spores. Then five to eight years later you can start to harvest the resulting black truffles. As périgord truffles are harvested in the autumn and winter, the season in Australia runs from May until mid August. Geoff Barrett, co-founder and managing director of Oak Valley Truffles in Western Australia, says this gives the country's producers a huge advantage because they are selling their crop when they are none available from Europe. "Australia's truffle industry is doing so well because we don't have any competitors," he says. "We produce truffles in the southern hemisphere when there are none in the northern hemisphere." Given that fresh truffles only have a shelf life of two weeks, it means that thanks to Australia's crop, chefs in the northern hemisphere can now sell dishes including the priced ingredient in their spring and summer. "We export to 31 countries, and don't have the supply by even half to match the demand from overseas," says Alex Wilson, head of sales at The Truffle & Wine Co - Australia's first commercial truffle farm or truffière, and the single largest producer of black truffles in the southern hemisphere. "We export around 85% of our truffles and I pre-sell the whole crop," he says. Truffle & Wine Co is so bullish about the industry's growth that it has ripped up around 80% of its former vineyards in Western Australia to allow expansion of the truffière. While Western Australia, and more specifically, the town of Manjimup, produces the lion's share of Australia's périgord truffles - there are now 300 farms scattered across the country, and this number is expected to grow. Colin Carter, vice president of the Australian Truffle Growers Association, says that his members are well versed on how to produce good crops, such as adding limestone to their soils to reach the desired alkaline levels. Mr Wilson says this knowhow means that the industry in Australia is "leaps and bounds ahead" of more recent efforts to farm truffles in South Africa, and countries in South America. "Australia has a multi-tonne commercial industry, while places such as South Africa are still finding their feet," he adds. Alongside Australia's successful exports, a small domestic market is also developing. While truffles have long been a menu staple in Europe, the delicate fungus is a more recent addition to Australia's gastronomy scene, so part of the challenge for local growers has been around education and raising the profile of truffles. "If you mentioned truffles to someone in Australia 20 years ago, most would have assumed you were talking about a chocolate," says Barrett. "Now I'd say 95% of people know what a truffle is, and many are inquisitive as to how they're grown and used." Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: French-born chef Philippe Mouchel says he's noticed greater consumer awareness of truffles at his namesake restaurant in Melbourne's central business district. "During the Australian season we use fresh black truffles across much of our menu and people ask for it," he says. "If you look around Melbourne, everyone is doing truffle degustation dinners throughout winter and they're so popular they sell out. "There are more and more truffles around, chefs want to work with them and people want to enjoy them." To help continue to raise this awareness, Mr Wood of Truffle Paddock, helps to organise an annual truffle festival in Melbourne. And back on his truffle farm he has just spent the autumn and winter welcoming visitors to join him and his dogs hunting for the precious crop. "On most hunts, guests are invited to smell the truffle in the earth before it's harvested, and sometimes get to dig out the truffle," he says. "People really enjoy that part and often want to buy the truffle they harvested to take home, share, and most likely brag about." Regarding the wider industry in the country, he says: "There is good reason to think that Australia could become the world's largest producer of black truffles within the decade. "Some Western Australia estimates suggest that in 10 years their production will quadruple, as many newer and very large and medium-sized farms come into production. And although the east coast is usually characterised by small to medium-sized farms, more recently some large farms have also been established."
Although the official result has not yet been declared, main rival Mar Roxas admitted defeat after polls gave Mr Duterte an unassailable lead. Mr Duterte said he accepted the mandate with "extreme humility". The 71-year-old stirred controversy during campaigning with his incendiary comments. He has credited his success to his tough stance on law and order. His record as the crime-crushing mayor of the southern town of Davao, once notorious for its lawlessness, earned him the moniker The Punisher and resonated with voters. "Duterte Harry" in quotes The Philippines elects its first transgender politician Populism, celebrity and ugly realities in the Philippines Who were the candidates in the Philippines' elections? Other driving issues of the election campaign were pervasive corruption, as well as the poverty and inequality experienced by many Filipinos despite economic growth under outgoing President Benigno "Noynoy" Aquino. What next for Duterte: Analysis by Jonathan Head, BBC News, Manila Rodrigo Duterte, a man dubbed by his rivals as an executioner who would bring terror to the Philippines, has won the presidency by a clear margin, polling nearly twice as many votes as his nearest rivals. But what is less clear is what he will do with the job. His blunt promise to sweep away criminals and corrupt officials won him the backing of millions of Filipinos weary of ineffective governments. But he has so far offered few policy details. A spokesman has already pledged a radical overhaul of the political system. Human rights groups have warned he may repeat what happened in the southern city of Davao, where as mayor he is accused of allowing death squads to murder hundreds of alleged criminals. Mr Duterte has a formidable task in a country still hampered by poverty and poor infrastructure - just meeting the lofty expectations he raised during his campaign will be hard enough. Election officials have said there was a record turnout at polling stations, with more than 81% of the 54 million registered voters casting a ballot. Senators and about 18,000 local officials including mayors are also being elected. The PPCRV (Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting) poll monitor said that with 90% of the presidential ballots counted, Mr Duterte had more than 14.8m votes - about 39%. The PPCRV is accredited by the election commission to monitor counting but its reporting does not represent an official tally. Mr Roxas, a former interior minister and Mr Duterte's closest rival, had 8.6 million votes. As the extent of his lead became clear, Mr Duterte told AFP news agency: "It's with humility, extreme humility, that I accept this, the mandate of the people." Mr Roxas accepted his rival's win. "There are many tears in the room. Let me tell you this is not a time for tears. For our country, we have had a peaceful, successful transfer of power." Another key rival, Senator Grace Poe, was the first to concede defeat, promising to "co-operate with the healing process" after a turbulent campaign. In the election to be vice-president, Leni Robredo, a social activist, is currently slightly ahead of Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos, the son of a former dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The appeal of Duterte: Analysis by Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent The statistics are stark, and bleak. Experts say anywhere between 40% and 80% of Philippine legislators are connected to political dynasties with vested interests. A handful of the families control almost all of the country's wealth. And perhaps the bleakest statistic of all: 25% of the population lives under the poverty line - a figure that has not changed much in two decades. So it shouldn't come as a surprise then that Filipinos have chosen Mr Duterte's crime-busting, tough-talking, action-oriented ways over the current administration's candidate Manuel Roxas. More on this from Karishma Mr Aquino is standing down as the constitution limits presidents to one six-year term. As Mr Duterte rose in opinion polls ahead of voting, Mr Aquino had tried to unite other candidates against him, warning his election could mean a return to dictatorship for the Philippines. Mr Duterte has made many controversial statements during his campaign, saying that he would massacre criminals and drug-users, joking about the rape of an Australian missionary and saying he would dissolve congress if it didn't agree with him. He has also given forthright opinions on the Philippines' territorial dispute with China in the South China Sea, saying he would sail to disputed islands and plant the Philippine flag there. The Philippines has taken one of its claims to a court of arbitration at the Hague. On Monday, he said he would seek multilateral talks over the issue, to include the US and Japan. Duterte: From 'Punisher' to president
Csatary died in hospital in Hungary after suffering from a number of medical problems, said Gabor Horvath. He at one time topped the list of most wanted Nazi war crimes suspects and is alleged to have helped deport 15,700 Jews to death camps in World War II. He faced charges relating to his wartime activities in both Hungary and in neighbouring Slovakia. Mr Horvath said his client died on Saturday morning. "He had been treated for medical issues for some time but contracted pneumonia, from which he died." Csatary had denied the allegations against him, saying he was merely an intermediary between Hungarian and German officials and was not involved in war crimes. Art dealer He was charged in June by Hungarian prosecutors in relation to what they said had been his role as chief of an internment camp for Jews in Kosice, a town then part of Hungary but now in Slovakia. Kosice, known at the time as Kassa, was the first camp to be established after Germany occupied Hungary in March 1944. Prosecutors said in a statement that Csatary, a Hungarian police officer at the time, had "deliberately provided help to the unlawful executions and torture committed against Jews deported to concentration camps... from Kosice". He was accused of regularly beating prisoners with his bare hands and a dog whip. Csatary, whose full name is Laszlo Csizsik-Csatary, was sentenced to death in his absence in Czechoslovakia in 1948 for war crimes. Slovakia was seeking his extradition from Hungary so it could formally sentence him although, with the abolition of the death penalty, it intended to imprison him. The legal proceedings in Hungary were halted last month on the grounds of double jeopardy. Csatary was named in 2012 by the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center as its most wanted suspect. It claimed he oversaw the deportations of Jews from Kosice to the Auschwitz death camp. He was tracked down in Budapest in July 2012 by reporters from the UK's Sun newspaper, with help from the Simon Wiesenthal Center, and was put under house arrest. He had fled to Canada after the war, where he worked as an art dealer in Montreal and Toronto, and disappeared in 1997 after being stripped of his Canadian citizenship. The US-based Simon Wiesenthal Center said it was "deeply disappointed" by the news of his death. "It is a shame that Csatary, a convicted... and totally unrepentant Holocaust perpetrator who was finally indicted in his homeland for his crimes, ultimately eluded justice and punishment at the very last minute,'' Efraim Zuroff, the centre's director, said in a statement. The Simon Wiesenthal Center last month launched its Operation Last Chance II project, offering rewards for information that could help it track down the last surviving Nazi war criminals and bring them to justice. Among its most wanted is Alois Brunner, a key operative of Adolf Eichmann, who was last seen in Syria in 2001, and Aribert Heim, a doctor at three concentration camps, who disappeared in 1962 and was last seen in Egypt in 1992.
Ms Murad is an Iraqi Yazidi who was tortured and raped by Islamic State militants and later became the face of a campaign to free the Yazidi people. Dr Mukwege is a Congolese gynaecologist who, along with his colleagues, has treated tens of thousands of victims. Some 331 individuals and organisations were nominated for the prestigious peace award this year. The winners announced in the Norwegian capital Oslo on Friday won the award for their "efforts to end the use of sexual violence as a weapon of war", Berit Reiss-Andersen, the Nobel committee chair, said. The pair both made a "crucial contribution to focusing attention on, and combating, such war crimes", Ms Reiss-Andersen added. How have the winners reacted? Ms Murad, 25, said in a statement that many Yazidis would "look upon this prize and think of family members that were lost, are still unaccounted for, and of the 1,300 women and children, which remain in captivity". "For myself, I think of my mother, who was murdered by DAESH [IS], the children with whom I grew up, and what we must do to honour them," she added. "Persecution of minorities must end. We must work together with determination - to prove that genocidal campaigns will not only fail, but lead to accountability for the perpetrators and justice for the survivors." New Iraqi President Barham Saleh called the award "an honour for all Iraqis who fought terrorism and bigotry". Dr Mukwege was operating at his hospital when he heard he had won the prize. "I was in the operating room so when they started to make noise around [it] I wasn't really thinking about what was going on, and suddenly some people came in and told me the news," he told Norwegian newspaper VG. He dedicated his award to all women affected by sexual violence. "This Nobel prize is a recognition of the suffering and the failure to adequately compensate women who are victims of rape and sexual violence in all countries around the world," he told reporters gathered outside his clinic. Who is Nadia Murad? Ms Murad did not just lose her mother in the genocide. She endured three months as a sex slave at the hands of IS militants. She was bought and sold several times and subjected to sexual and physical abuse during her captivity. After escaping, she became an activist for the Yazidi people, campaigning to help put an end to human trafficking and calling on the world to take a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war. Ms Murad described her escape in a BBC interview in 2016, detailing how the women who were held captive were treated by IS. She was awarded the Vaclav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Council of Europe in 2016 and called for an international court to judge crimes committed by IS in her acceptance speech in Strasbourg. Ms Murad, the first Iraqi to win the award, was named the UN's first goodwill ambassador for survivors of human trafficking later that year. Who is Denis Mukwege? He has spent decades helping rape victims in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He and his colleagues are said to have treated about 30,000 rape victims, developing great expertise in the treatment of serious injuries sustained during sex assaults that were carried out as a weapon of war. The 63-year-old has won a number of international prizes, including the 2008 UN Human Rights Prize, and was named African of the Year in 2009. He lives under the permanent protection of UN peacekeepers at his hospital and has also previously called for a tougher line on rape as a weapon of war. Denis Mukwege in his own words It was in 1999 that our first rape victim was brought into the hospital. After being raped, bullets had been fired into her genitals and thighs. I thought that was a barbaric act of war but the real shock came three months later. Forty-five women came to us with the same story, they were all saying: "People came into my village and raped me, tortured me." Other women came to us with burns. They said that after they had been raped, chemicals had been poured on their genitals. I started to ask myself what was going on. These weren't just violent acts of war, but part of a strategy. You had situations where multiple people were raped at the same time, publicly - a whole village might be raped during the night. In doing this, they hurt not just the victims but the whole community, which they force to watch. The result of this strategy is that people are forced to flee their villages, abandon their fields, their resources, everything. It's very effective. Who else won a Nobel award this year? Earlier this week the Nobel prize for physics was awarded to Donna Strickland, only the third woman winner of the award and the first in 55 years. The Canadian was honoured along with Arthur Ashkin, from the US, and Gerard Mourou, from France. The Nobel prize for medicine was awarded to two scientists - Professor James P Allison from the US and Professor Tasuku Honjo from Japan - who discovered how to fight cancer using the body's immune system. For chemistry, the prize was awarded to three scientists for their discoveries in enzyme research. Americans Frances Arnold and George P Smith shared the prize with Briton Gregory Winter How is the prize decided?
Nuon Chea, 88, served as leader Pol Pot's deputy and Khieu Samphan, 83, was the Maoist regime's head of state. They are the first top-level leaders to be held accountable for its crimes. Up to two million people are thought to have died under the 1975-79 Khmer Rouge regime - of starvation and overwork or executed as enemies of the state. Judge Nil Nonn said the men were guilty of "extermination encompassing murder, political persecution, and other inhumane acts comprising forced transfer, enforced disappearances and attacks against human dignity''. Lawyers for the pair said they would appeal against the ruling. "It is unjust for my client. He did not know or commit many of these crimes," Son Arun, a lawyer for Nuon Chea, told journalists. They will remain in detention while this takes place. 'Anger remains' The regime sought to create an agrarian society: cities were emptied and their residents forced to work on rural co-operatives. Many were worked to death while others starved as the economy imploded. During four violent years, the Khmer Rouge also killed all those it perceived as enemies - intellectuals, minorities, former officials - and their families. Nuon Chea was seen as an ideological driving force within the regime. Khieu Samphan was its public face. Prosecutors argued that they formulated policy and were complicit in its brutal execution. Over three years the court has heard from some of those who lost entire families to the regime. "My anger remains in my heart,'' Suon Mom, 75, whose husband and four children starved to death, told the Associated Press news agency. "I still remember the day I left Phnom Penh, walking along the road without having any food or water to drink." Jonathan Head, BBC News, Phnom Penh After three years of hearings, and a summary of charges that ran for 90 minutes, the presiding judge delivered sentencing against the two elderly defendants surprisingly briskly. Both men were guilty of crimes against humanity, both were sentenced to life in prison. Khieu Samphan, the urbane, international face of the Khmer Rouge, was found not to have had authority over those carrying out the worst atrocities documented by the tribunal. Nuon Chea was found guilty on all charges. Both in the end received the same sentence, somewhat academic given that both men are in their eighties, and in poor health. They had insisted on their innocence, dismissing the accusations against them as propaganda and lies. Their defence, though, was dismissed by the tribunal as lacking credibility. Nuon Chea, unable to stand for the sentence, showed little emotion, but Khieu Samphan appeared visibly angry. They had told their families not to come and hear the verdicts. It was in many ways an anticlimactic end to the only official accounting for the horrors of the Khmer Rouge years. The true value of this unique "hybrid" tribunal, blending international and Cambodian judicial authority, is still difficult to assess. Justice delayed Outside the court, Khmer Rouge survivor Nou Saota said: "I feel so happy and relieved. A huge burden has been lifted off me." Youk Chang, another survivor, told the BBC the verdict was "a little too late for many" but said it was vital the trial took place. "It's important for the young population to learn this lesson so that we can prevent such atrocity from occurring anywhere, not just in Cambodia," he said. Rights group Amnesty International, meanwhile, called the ruling "an important step towards justice", as it noted "troubling" obstacles the court had faced. Some have criticised the slow pace and cost of the court. In 2012, a Swiss judge resigned, saying his investigations into other Khmer Rouge suspects were being blocked. 'Socialist revolution' Both Khmer Rouge leaders denied the charges against them. In closing statements last year, they expressed remorse but said they had neither ordered deaths nor been aware of them. In a statement shortly after the ruling, the court said both men had participated in "a joint criminal enterprise to achieve the common purpose of implementing a rapid socialist revolution... by whatever means necessary". The pair also face a separate genocide trial. The case against them was split to accelerate proceedings, because of their age. Who were the Khmer Rouge? Cambodia's brutal Khmer Rouge regime Two other former Khmer Rouge ministers were to be tried with them. Ieng Sary, the former foreign minister, died in March 2013. His wife Ieng Thirith, who served as the regime's social affairs minister, has been ruled unfit to stand trial. Before this, former prison chief Duch was the only senior Khmer Rouge figure held to account, but he was not part of the regime's central leadership. He was jailed in 2010 for running the Tuol Sleng prison, where thousands of people defined as enemies of the regime were tortured and killed.
When a bottle covered in barnacles containing a note inside washed up on Airlie Beach, in Queensland Australia, a local tour operator took to social media to find out more. In a Facebook post showing employee Daniel McNally holding up the bottle, Whitehaven Beach Tours asked its social media followers to "stay tuned for the grand opening". Once opened, the company discovered the note was written in Mandarin Chinese, and appealed for help in translating it. Soon, help flooded in. Co-worker Rach Elle had a look and when she discovered it was a love letter written by a sailor to his fiancée, she shared his words in the hope that the woman may be tracked down. The sailor, who was newly-engaged and crossing the Indian Ocean, was not expecting anyone to pick it up but just wished he could be with his love for ever. Another former employee, Judy Hu, helped with translation, calling it a "lovely story discovered from the ocean". And so, the sailor's words were shared: "Deep in my heart, I miss my fiancée so bad. I went to sea straight after I got engaged. "I feel really sorry for her. This bottle is a way to express my affection from my heart. "I hope that once I go back home, I will be with Jing for ever. "This bottle will stay deep in the ocean, I don't expect anyone would get this or even open this. "I'm just looking for a comfort for my heart." An Australia-based blogger wrote about the note and appealed for help to search for the fiancée on China's social media site Weibo on 24 September. "There are 1.4 billion people in China. I don't know many Chinese people. Can you help me in your social media?" As photos of the bottle were shared, some users described the note as so romantic, they could cry. You may also be interested in: News of the note spread across several Chinese websites, including the Guangzhou Daily. One woman from Tianjin wrote: "It's amazing to have such a husband. If my ex-boyfriend was like him, we would not have broken up. He left me because of my bad skin which is gone now. Regret being with him. Hope I can find a good boyfriend for myself." In Shanxi, all hope was restored for one Weibo user who wrote: "There is something called true love." As yet, neither the sailor nor the fiancée have been tracked down.

Some 6,000 members of the judiciary and military, including generals, have been detained. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to purge state bodies of the "virus" that had caused the revolt. The US Secretary of State, John Kerry, has stressed the importance of democratic rule. Speaking in Brussels where he has been meeting European foreign ministers, Mr Kerry said the US stood squarely on the side of the elected leadership in Turkey: "We will certainly support bringing perpetrators of the coup to justice - but we also caution against a reach that goes well beyond that." Mr Erdogan said on Sunday that Turkey would consider reinstating the death penalty - a suggestion that was met with strong opposition from EU leaders. "No country can become an EU member if it introduces the death penalty," said the EU's foreign affairs chief, Federica Mogherini. A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel was similarly clear that such a move would spell an end to Turkey's longstanding, albeit stalled, application for EU membership. Capital punishment was abolished in 2004 as part of Turkey's bid to join the bloc. Nobody has been executed in the country since 1984. Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said that 208 "martyrs" had lost their lives during the failed coup attempt, including 60 police, three soldiers and 145 civilians. Another 1,491 were injured, he said. Twenty-four alleged coup plotters were killed, Mr Yildirim said - a smaller number than Turkish officials previously reported. Little room for taking risks: analysis by Rengin Arslan, BBC Turkish, Istanbul Three years ago when the AK Party government began its fight against Fethullah Gulen - a cleric in self-imposed exile in the US, who was a close ally of Mr Erdogan for years - it began with the police department. The government knew where to find Gulen supporters, in part because it had helped them to take positions within the police when they were still allies. When the fight against Gulen movement started thousands of police were moved sideways into roles where they would not harm the government. Now, instead of being reshuffled, thousands of police personnel have been suspended from their duties. Obviously Mr Erdogan has little room for taking risks. In a country which also faces threats from so-called Islamic State and Kurdish militants in its big cities, and has been targeted by suicide bombs, it is difficult to predict what the result of these large-scale suspensions will be. But with these personnel or without them, it will take time for anyone in Turkey to feel safe. More than 100 generals and admirals have been detained in raids across the country. Police and prosecutors searched Incirlik air base near the Syrian border on Monday. The base is used by warplanes of the US-led coalition against so-called Islamic State to launch attacks on the group in Syria. Turkey had restricted flights from the base in the hours following the coup attempt. The air force academy in Istanbul was raided on Monday morning. According to state media, prosecutors have begun questioning an alleged ringleader of the coup attempt, former air force commander Akin Ozturk. Overnight and into Monday morning the suspended police officers were called to regional headquarters and forced to hand over their weapons, Hurriyet reports. Many provincial governors and judges have also been relieved of their duties. The Turkish government accuses cleric Fethullah Gulen of being behind the plot. Mr Gulen lives in the US and strongly denies any involvement. Mr Kerry said Turkey must produce evidence to support any extradition application for the cleric. Eight Turkish military officers who fled to Greece by helicopter appeared in court in the Greek border city of Alexandropouli charged with entering the country illegally. Proceedings were adjourned until Thursday. Turkey has requested their extradition; they have applied for asylum in Greece. Ms Mogherini stressed the importance of the rule of law prevailing, and said ministers shared concerns about "what is happening in Turkey in these hours" - a reference to the rounding up of suspects. "We need to respect, have Turkey respect, democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms," she said. Johannes Hahn, the commissioner in Brussels dealing with Turkey's accession negotiations, said it appeared the Turkish government had pre-prepared lists of people to arrest before the coup attempt. The Turkish government says it was gathering evidence of a "secretive organisation" working within state structures even before the failed coup. Are you in Turkey?

Frauke Petry, head of the eurosceptic Alternativ fuer Deutschland (AfD) party, told a regional newspaper: "I don't want this either. But the use of armed force is there as a last resort." Her comments were condemned by leftwing parties and by the German police union. More than 1.1 million migrants arrived in Germany last year. Also on Saturday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said most migrants from Syria and Iraq would go home once the wars in their countries had ended. She told a conference of her centre-right CDU party that tougher measures adopted last week should reduce the influx of migrants, but a European solution was still needed. Which migrants does the EU send back? Migrants feel the chill as border checks increase Will Germans embrace or shun migrants? Police must stop migrants crossing illegally from Austria, Ms Petry told the Mannheimer Morgen newspaper (in German), and "if necessary" use firearms. "That is what the law says," she added. A prominent member of the centre-left Social Democrats, Thomas Oppermann, said: "The last German politician under whom refugees were shot at was Erich Honecker" - the leader of Communist East Germany. Germany's police union, the Gewerkschaft der Polizei, said (in German) officers would never shoot at migrants. It said Ms Petry's comments revealed a radical and inhumane mentality. The number of attacks on refugee accommodation in Germany rose to 1,005 last year - five times more than in 2014. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.
Earlier this week it was announced a deal was almost secure to keep "Spy Booth" in the town, after campaigners raised the money to buy it. The piece, depicting men "snooping" on a phone box, appeared in April, three miles from government listening post GCHQ. The local businessman, who has agreed to pay for the artwork, said he was "confident" it could be saved. Jenny Lyon, whose boyfriend David Houghton spotted the vandalism on an early morning run, said: "There appears to be silver writing all over the three spies. It's completely ruined. It's awful. "People have worked so hard to keep it here and then somebody overnight has ruined it for everybody." 'Confident it will come off' Businessman Hekmat Kaveh, who agreed to pay an undisclosed amount to keep the artwork in place, said he believed it could be saved. "I believe the original paint had some anti-graffiti products in it and also an anti-graffiti product was put over the top of it. I am confident that it will come off," he said. Mr Kaveh said he was "rather surprised" local people had begun trying to remove the silver paint with a brush. "I would much rather get the professionals onto it," he said. Experts will be called in to complete the clean-up work on Saturday and Perspex will be put over it for protection. Gloucestershire Police said officers were carrying out inquiries and appealed for anyone who witnessed the act of vandalism to get in touch. Campaigners have been trying to keep the artwork in situ on the corner of Fairview Road and Hewlett Road after owners of the house claimed it had been sold and workmen arrived to remove it. Last month, Cheltenham Borough Council issued a temporary stop notice preventing further removal work from taking place on the Grade II* listed building.
Vincent Ni and Yitsing WangBBC World Service Moving slowly and carefully along the pavement, some crouched, others tilted their heads towards the ground, as curious onlookers snapped photos. It was a performance staged by the artist Deng Yufeng, who was trying to demonstrate how difficult it was to dodge CCTV cameras in the Chinese capital. As governments and companies around the world boost their investments in security networks, hundreds of millions more surveillance cameras are expected to be installed in 2021 - and most of them will be in China, according to industry analysts IHS Markit. By 2018, there were already about 200 million surveillance cameras in China. And by 2021 this number is expected to reach 560 million, according to the Wall Street Journal, roughly one for every 2.4 citizens. China says the cameras prevent crime. And in 2018, the number of victims of intentional homicide per head of population in China was 10 times lower than in the US, according to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. But a growing number of Chinese citizens are questioning the effect on their privacy. They also wonder what would happen if their personal data was compromised. 'Recruited volunteers' It is rare for Chinese citizens to stage protests against government surveillance. And it is not without risk. But creative types such as Deng are coming up with innovative ways to bring the issue out into the open. Before the performance, he measured the length and width of Happiness Avenue with a ruler. He then recorded the brands of the 89 CCTV cameras alongside it and mapped out their distributions and ranges. And finally, he recruited volunteers online. It took them more than two hours to walk 1.1km (0.7 miles) along Happiness Avenue. They managed to avoid their faces being caught on camera, but Deng said it would have been "almost impossible" to have avoided being filmed completely. "It was harder than I had expected," volunteer Joyce Ge, 19, told BBC News. "I thought there were just a few cameras and I could easily duck and cover. But it turned out not to be the case at all. The cameras were really all over the place, and it was impossible to evade them." Black market It is not the first time Deng has tried to raise public awareness about privacy and digital security. Two years ago, the former sculptor bought the personal data of more than 300,000 residents throughout the country from an online black market and put it on public display at a museum in Wuhan. The police shut down the exhibition two days after it opened. After relocating to Beijing earlier this year, Deng noticed the growing number of cameras in front of his apartment building and across the city. "[These cameras represent] government power - and their 'intrusion' into the lives of private citizens," he said. "Most people are probably used to cameras on the street. "But I still pay attention unconsciously. "When a lot of cameras are looking at me, I always try to avoid them. "It's a subconscious reaction - a sense of conflict in me, even if I'm not doing anything bad." Deng divided the road into five levels: "One of the most difficult areas was a car-park entrance, which was next to a big company, so there were five cameras pointing at one spot at the same time," Deng said. "It's also very difficult to deal with a rotating camera. "So I sometimes had to stay in one place for two or three hours to record how often the camera rotated." Police cars Deng created a set of "tactical steps" as a part of the instructions to volunteers. When there was a camera on one side, they were told to walk sideways, like a crab. To avoid a camera installed high up, they had to cling to a wall and traverse its lower edge. And in areas with a high concentration of cameras, additional props were required - foliage, billboards and even temporarily parked police cars. But despite his careful planning, there was still shock when he and his volunteers finally stood on Happiness Avenue for the experiment. "Halfway down the road, we noticed that a few more cameras had been added," Deng said. "I was confused as I'd only been away for less than a fortnight. "But we managed to improvise. "And we adjusted our route a little." Chinese media says most of the CCTV cameras are part of the government's Sky Net project. Last year, the New York Times reported Facial-recognition data allowed Chinese police to match a face on camera with a number of profiles, including: Critics say the authorities are making full use of the surveillance network to monitor dissidents and stop protests. In 2018, Chinese police used facial recognition to catch more than 60 suspects at Hong Kong pop singer Jacky Cheung's concerts in mainland China. But not all Chinese citizens are critical of government surveillance. Joyce Ge said some of her classmates were unimpressed by her involvement in the experiment. "They say it's natural for the public to relinquish some of their freedoms and rights to the government, because they are ultimately responsible for the safety of the public," she said. Another participant in Deng's project, Kaka - not her real name - was concerned about data security. Kaka, 32, who works in the advertising industry, said she believed her identity information had been compromised, leading to extortion demands. Kaka had brought along her daughter, five and a half, the youngest participant in the project. She said: "When we finished, my daughter said to me with a sense of triumph, 'Mummy, we finally defeated the cameras.'"
By Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva And this month it is introducing the highest minimum monthly salary in the world, in response to a referendum at the end of September. The new hourly rate of 23 Swiss francs - equivalent to £19, $25 or €22 - will give a minimum monthly salary of 4,000 francs (£3,350). Why the need? This Swiss canton may be rich but it is also home to tens of thousands of hotel workers, waiters, cleaners and hairdressers who struggle to make ends meet. When Switzerland went into lockdown last March, images of lines of people at food banks in Geneva made headlines. In fact, the food banks existed before the pandemic, and they are still there months after the lockdown ended. Charly Hernandez's charity Colis du Coeur distributes thousands of bags of groceries a week at one food bank in the city centre. The lines are long, most of the people queuing are women, many of them have young children. Isn't 4,000 francs a month too much? It may sound a lot, but only if you don't live in Geneva, Charly explains. "A single room is 1,000 francs a month, if you can survive on 500 francs a month for food you're a very good manager, health insurance is 550 a month per person. If you are a family with two kids, you barely scrape by." The new minimum wage will make a difference to many people, like Ingrid, who have been going to the food bank. "At the end of the month my pockets are empty," she says. "This [food bank] has been great, because you have a week of food. A week of relief." Even some of the volunteers, like Laura, find Geneva's cost of living difficult. On her nurse's salary, she can't really afford a place of her own in the city. "I would be living in a very small place, in one room. So I still live with my family. I'm 26," she says. Who will pay? Businesses offering less than 23 francs an hour will now have to give employees a pay rise. To have to bear this new cost in the middle of the Covid pandemic and a drastic drop in profits could cause more harm than good, fears Vincent Subilia of Geneva's Chamber of Commerce. "Hotels, restaurants, these are areas which are already confronted with major challenges due to the pandemic," he says. "This could potentially jeopardise the very existence of these sectors." One restaurateur, Stefano Fanari, told Swiss television he did not think he would be able to foot the bill. As the head chef, his monthly wage averages between 5,000 and 6,000 francs a month. "How can I continue when I have to pay the dish washers that much? "Should I cut their hours? Don't get me wrong, I'm not against someone earning 4,000 a month. But there's a point where we just can't pay that. I've sacrificed, I work 12 hours a day here. What should I do?" So what happens now? Geneva's minimum wage came into law not because the government imposed it, but because Geneva citizens proposed it as a "people's initiative". They gathered enough signatures to call a referendum on the issue, and on 27 September voters said yes, by a pretty overwhelming 58% to 42%. Switzerland's system of direct democracy means the voters have the final say, so the minimum wage is now obligatory. Often, Swiss citizens tend to vote very cautiously when it comes to spending public money. But on the same day they also backed the nationwide introduction of two weeks' paid paternity leave. For Charly Hernandez these moves are positive signs that, especially in such difficult times, people in this largely wealthy country are looking out for one another. "They voted for it, and I'm elated. We do have a very direct democracy that is great, but what many people don't know is that most people's initiatives get turned down. "It's exceptional that things get approved, so I believe things are improving… OK at a slow pace, but that is the Swiss pace." The next test for voters will come later this month when the Swiss will decide on a "responsible business initiative". That would require companies based in Switzerland to take legal and financial responsibility for human rights and environmental abuses right along their supply chains, anywhere in the world. A yes to that could cost far more than Geneva's world-beating minimum wage. More stories from our Switzerland correspondent
By Nikhil InamdarBBC News, Mumbai Its neighbour India has sensed an opportunity and is keen to make inroads to a space it hopes China will vacate sooner rather than later. China's weakened global position is a "blessing in disguise" for India to attract more investment, transport minister Nitin Gadkari said in a recent interview. The northern state of Uttar Pradesh, which has a population the size of Brazil, is already forming an economic task force to attract firms keen to ditch China. India is also readying a pool of land twice the size of Luxembourg to offer companies that want to move manufacturing out of China, and has reached out to 1,000 American multinationals, Bloomberg reported. "This outreach has been an ongoing process," Deepak Bagla, chief executive of Invest India, the government's national investment promotion agency told the BBC. "Covid will only accelerate the process of de-risking from China for many of these companies." The US-India Business Council (USIBC), a powerful lobby group that works to enhance investment flows between India and the US, also said that India has significantly stepped up its pitch. "We are seeing India prioritise efforts to attract supply chains, both at central and state government level," Nisha Biswal, President of USIBC and the former assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs in the US Department of State, told the BBC. "Companies that already have some manufacturing in India may be earlier movers in reducing output in plants in China and scaling up in production in India." But things are still at an evaluation stage and decisions are unlikely to be made in a hurry, she added. In an environment where global balance sheets are fractured, relocating entire supply chains is easier said than done. "Many of these companies are facing severe cash and capital constraints because of the pandemic, and will therefore be very cautious before making quick moves," independent economist Rupa Subramanya said. According to Rahul Jacob, a long-time China watcher and former Financial Times bureau chief in Hong Kong, the Indian government putting together land banks is a step in the right direction, but large companies are unlikely to move their operations just because land is made available. "Production lines and supply chains are far more sticky than most people seem to understand. It is very difficult to pull them apart overnight," he said. "China offers integrated infrastructure like large ports and highways, top quality labour and sophisticated logistics, all of which are critical factors to meet strict deadlines that international companies operate on." Another reason India might not be the obvious choice for global multinationals is because it isn't well integrated with major global supply chains. Last year Delhi pulled out of a crucial multilateral trade agreement with 12 other Asian countries, collectively known as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), despite seven years of negotiations. Decisions like these make it difficult for Indian exporters to benefit from tariff-free access to destination markets or offer reciprocity to its trading partners. "Why would I make something that I want to sell to Singapore in India? Being connected in trade agreements institutionally is as important as offering competitive prices," Parag Khanna, author of The Future is Asian, told the BBC. Regional integration is particularly crucial he believes, as global trade begins to follow the "sell where you make" model where companies so-called "near-source" rather than out-source production and bring it closer to demand. India's volatile relationship with foreign direct investment (FDI) and uneven regulation is also something that continues to bother global companies. From prohibiting e-commerce companies to sell non-essential items and tweaking FDI rules to disallow easier capital flows from neighbouring countries, the fear is that India has used the pandemic to build protectionist walls around itself. In a recent address to the nation, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made "be vocal for local" his rallying cry. New stimulus proposals meanwhile have increased thresholds for foreign companies bidding for Indian contracts. "The more that India can improve regulatory stability, the better its chances of persuading more global businesses to establish hubs in India," says Mr Biswal. So then who, If not India? As things stand, Vietnam, Bangladesh, South Korea and Taiwan seem to be favourites to benefit from the backlash against China. The latter two at the "high-tech end of the spectrum" and Vietnam and Bangladesh at the lower end, according to Mr Jacob. Multinationals began moving production out of China into these countries nearly a decade ago due to rising labour and environmental costs. The slow exodus has only gathered pace as US-China trade tensions have increased in recent years. Since June 2018, a month before the trade war began, US goods imports from Vietnam have soared by more than 50% and those from Taiwan by 30%, according to calculations made by the South China Morning Post newspaper. India is seen to have lost out because it failed to create conditions allowing multinationals to supply not only the local market, but also to use the country as a production base to export to the world. In recent weeks, several states have begun making moves to address some concerns around the ease of doing business - prime among them being making contentious changes to India's archaic labour laws, put in place to reduce exploitation. Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh states, for instance, have suspended significant labour protections exempting factories from even maintaining basic requirements like cleanliness, ventilation, lighting and toilets. The intention is to improve the investment climate and attract global capital. But such decisions could become counterproductive and hurt rather than help, says Mr Jacob: "International companies would be very wary about this. They have strict codes of conduct on labour, environment and safety standards for suppliers." The 2013 collapse of the Rana Plaza garment factory in Bangladesh that supplied retailers like Walmart was a turning point. It forced Bangladesh to significantly improve factory infrastructure and safety to clinch more investment, he cautions. "India has to follow better standards. These are white board ideas drafted on Powerpoint by bureaucrats who are completely divorced from the reality of global trade." But with the US weighing punitive action against China, Japan paying its corporations to move out of the country and UK lawmakers coming under pressure to reconsider their decision to allow Chinese telecoms giant Huawei a role in building the country's new 5G data network, global anti-China sentiment is increasing. The time is ripe, say experts, for India to undertake broad-based structural reforms and use these sweeping geopolitical shifts to modify its trading relationship with the world.
The LSE said Panorama reporter John Sweeney posed as one of its professors on a study trip in order to film undercover in the country. The union's Alex Peters-Day said the BBC used students "as a human shield". Sweeney said the students were told a journalist was with them but that the LSE was not as it was not an LSE trip. 'Nazi state' Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme, Sweeney said: "For the LSE to put words into the mouths of those LSE students... is extraordinary. For them to say kill this programme - that feels entirely wrong. "What the LSE is saying we dispute. I can't talk for those students - they are grown-up, they are brave and good people. "All of those students could have dobbed me in. They didn't, the majority of these students support this programme." Sweeney spent eight days undercover inside North Korea for the programme. He travelled with his wife and a cameraman. Sweeney described North Korea as a "Nazi state" that practised the "most extreme form of censorship". He added: "It's more like Hitler's Germany than any other state in this world right now. It's extraordinarily scary, dark and evil." But the LSE students' union general secretary, Ms Peters-Day - who was not on the trip - told the BBC News channel: "One of the students made it absolutely clear that she was not made aware of what happened. "For us, this is a matter of student welfare - students were lied to, they weren't able to give their consent." She said all LSE's future research was "now at risk". "I think the trip was organised by the BBC as potentially a ruse for them to get into North Korea and that's disgraceful. "They've used students essentially as a human shield in this situation." In an email sent to LSE students and staff, the university said: "It is LSE's view that the students were not given enough information to enable informed consent, yet were given enough to put them in serious danger if the subterfuge had been uncovered prior to their departure from North Korea. "While this particular trip was run in the name of a student society, the nature of LSE's teaching and research means that aspects of North Korea are legitimate objects of study in several of our academic disciplines. "The BBC's actions may do serious damage to LSE's reputation for academic integrity and may have seriously compromised the future ability of LSE students and staff to undertake legitimate study of North Korea, and very possibly of other countries where suspicion of independent academic work runs high." 'Full apology' It said the LSE was "fully supportive of the principle of investigative journalism in the public interest" but could not condone the use of its name, or the use of its students, "as cover for such activities". It also said two other people working for the BBC also went on the trip. "At no point prior to the trip was it made clear to the students that a BBC team of three had planned to use the trip as cover for a major documentary to be shown on Panorama," it added. The LSE said BBC director general Lord Hall refused its request to withdraw the programme and "issue a full apology to LSE for the actions of BBC staff in using the school and its good reputation as a means of deception". A student who went on the trip, wishing to remain anonymous, told the Beaver that "we were not made aware of the presence of several BBC journalists at the time of the flight to Pyongyang. We were led to believe that John Sweeney was a history professor, although it was later implied that he was not a professor at the LSE." Also on Twitter, Craig Calhoun, the director of the LSE, said the "BBC story put LSE students at danger but seems to have found no new information and only shown what North Korea wants tourists to see". A BBC spokesman said: "We recognised that because it could increase the risks of the trip, the students should be told in advance that a journalist intended to travel with them, in order to enable the students to make their decision about whether they wanted to proceed. "They were given this information, and were reminded of it again, in time to have been able to change their plans if they wanted to. The students were all explicitly warned about the potential risks of travelling to North Korea with the journalist as part of their group. "This included a warning about the risk of arrest and detention and that they might not be allowed to return to North Korea in the future." Panorama: North Korea Undercover can be seen on BBC One at 20:30 BST on Monday.
By John SudworthBBC, Beijing "To get so many people to come to the streets," he mused, "must take organisation, a big sum of money and political resources." Since then, the protests sparked at the beginning of Hong Kong's hot summer have raged on through autumn and into winter. The massive marches have continued, interspersed with increasingly violent pitched battles between smaller groups of more militant protesters and the police. The toll is measured in a stark ledger of police figures that, even a short while ago, would have seemed impossible for one of the world's leading financial capitals and a bastion of social stability. More than 6,000 arrests, 16,000 tear-gas rounds, 10,000 rubber bullets. As the sense of political crisis has deepened and divisions have hardened, China has continued to see the sinister hand of foreign meddling behind every twist and turn. The 'grey rhino' In January, China's supreme political leader Xi Jinping convened a high-level Communist Party meeting focused on "major risk prevention". He told the assembled senior officials to be on their guard for "black swans" - the unpredictable, unseen events that can plunge a system into crisis. But he also warned them about what he called "grey rhinoceroses" - the known risks that are ignored until it's too late. While state media reports show the discussions ranging over issues from housing bubbles to food safety, there's no mention at all of Hong Kong. And yet the seeds were already being sown for what has become the biggest challenge to Communist Party rule in a generation. A few weeks after the meeting, the Hong Kong government, with the strong backing of Beijing, introduced a bill that would allow the extradition of suspects to mainland China. Opposition to the bill was immediate, deep-seated and widespread, driven by the fear that it would allow China's legal system to reach deep inside Hong Kong. Despite assurances that "political crimes" would not be covered, many saw it as a fundamental breach of the "one country, two systems" principle under which the territory is supposed to be governed. It wasn't just human rights groups and legal experts expressing alarm, but the business community, multinational corporations and foreign governments too, worried that overseas nationals might also find themselves targeted by such a law. And so, the first claims of "foreign meddling" began to be heard. On 9 June, a massive and overwhelmingly peaceful rally against the bill was held, with organisers putting the attendance at more than a million. The accusations made in person by officials, like the one mentioned earlier, were echoes of a narrative being taken up in earnest by China's Communist Party-controlled media. The morning after the march, an English language editorial in the China Daily raised the spectre of "interference". "Unfortunately, some Hong Kong residents have been hoodwinked by the opposition camp and their foreign allies into supporting the anti-extradition campaign," it said. From the protesters' point of view, the dismissal of their grievances as externally driven explains, to a large extent, what happened next. The city's political elite, backed by Beijing and insulated from ordinary Hong Kongers by a political system rigged in its favour, demonstrated a spectacular failure to accurately read the public mood. Three days after the march, with Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, insisting she would not back down, thousands of people surrounded the Legislative Council building where the bill was being debated. It was on the same spot just outside the chamber, less than five years earlier, that a phalanx of trucks with mechanical grabbers had begun scooping up rows of abandoned tents. To the sound of the snapping of poles and the crunching of bamboo barricades - the detritus of weeks of protest and occupation - 2014's pro-democracy demonstrations finally ran out of steam. Now the proposed law, one that may once have been seen as relatively inconsequential, was about to reignite the movement. The protesters threw bricks and bottles, the police fired tear gas and by the evening of 12 June, Hong Kong had witnessed one of its worst outbreaks of violence in decades. No-one could be in any doubt that the Umbrella Movement, with its demands for wider democratic reform, was back with a vengeance. The few concessions - first the suspension and finally the withdrawal of the bill - came too late to stop the cycle of escalating violence from both the protesters and the police. Beijing is right to point out that there are plenty of Hong Kongers who deplore the mask-clad militants building barricades, vandalising public property and setting fires. Some of them are ardent supporters of Chinese rule, others are simply being pragmatic, believing that violence will only provoke the central government into intervening more strongly in Hong Kong's affairs. But the authorities were stunned last month by a test of the true strength of those viewpoints, when - on a record turnout in local elections - the pro-democracy camp swept the board. The poll gave its candidates almost 60% of the total share of the votes. At first there was an astonished silence from mainland China, which had genuinely thought the pro-Beijing side would win. The initial news reports mentioned only the conclusion of the voting, not the results, but then came a familiar refrain. The state-run Xinhua news agency blamed "rioters" conspiring with "foreign forces". "The politicians behind them who are anti-China and want to mess up Hong Kong reaped substantial political benefits," it said. As proof of interference, China cites cases of foreign politicians voicing support for democracy or raising concerns about its erosion under Chinese rule. It has also blamed Washington for passing a law mandating an annual assessment of Hong Kong's political freedoms as a pre-condition for continuing the territory's special trading status. Xinhua has denounced it as "a malicious political manipulation that seriously interferes with Hong Kong affairs". But no evidence has been produced of any outside forces co-ordinating or directing the protests on the ground. In reality, the young, radical protesters, with the ubiquitous use of the portmanteau "Chinazi" in their street graffiti, appear as much motivated by statements from Beijing as they are from Washington. The very institutions - independent courts and a free press - that are supposed to be protected by the "one country, two systems" formula, are derided by the ruling Communist Party as dangerous, foreign constructs. Where once Hong Kongers might have hoped that China's economic rise would bring political freedoms to the mainland and a closer alignment with their values, many now fear the opposite. Mass detention camps in Xinjiang, a wider crackdown on civil society, and the abduction of Hong Kong citizens for perceived political crimes have all underlined the concern that their city is now ruled by political masters inherently hostile to the very things that make it special. And any appeal to universal values as underwriting Hong Kong's side of the "two systems", is anathema to Beijing, one that it rejects by conflating it with outside foreign meddling. Despite earlier fears, the central government seems unlikely to send in the army - a move certain to provoke even more of an international outcry. But nor can it offer a political solution. Giving the pro-democracy movement any more of what the Communist Party strains every fibre of its organisational structure to deny to the mass of Chinese people is impossible. Its values are stability and control, not freedom and democracy, and it struggles to understand how anyone would choose the latter over the former. So Beijing finds itself bound by a sense of historical destiny to a territory with which it is - in large part - in deep ideological opposition. It is a tension that has not gone unnoticed elsewhere in the region, in particular, in Taiwan, the self-governing island that China considers a breakaway province. Hong Kong's experience of one country, two systems, the Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has suggested, has shown that authoritarianism and democracy cannot coexist. Referring to the prospect of a similar formula being foisted on Taiwan she tweeted, in Chinese characters, the phrase bu ke neng - "Not a chance".
Police are investigating whether one of the bodies is that of a perpetrator. At least 10 people have been wounded. Three armed attackers were earlier reported to be on the run. Police urged people to avoid public places. Public transport shut for several hours after the attack at the Olympia centre in the north-western Moosach district. Police helicopters are flying over the city and the elite border security unit, GSG9, has been flown in. The body of the suspected attacker was found about 1km (0.6 miles) from the shopping centre, local media reported, and police were using a robot to check it for explosives. Live updates Munich shooting in pictures Eyewitness accounts German news magazine Focus reported that a gunman had shot himself in the head, but investigators have not commented. A car believed to be linked to the attack was taken away by police on a tow-truck, the magazine added. The Bavarian capital's central railway station was evacuated as authorities suspended all public transport. The system was reopened several hours later. Thousands of people stranded by the emergency and unable to get home were offered shelter by local residents. The initiative was launched with the Twitter hashtag #Offenetür (open door). Police, who describe the operation as "an acute terror situation", say the first reports of a shooting in Hanauer Street came in just before 18:00 (16:00 GMT). Chancellor Angela Merkel's chief of staff, Peter Altmaier, told national TV the motive for the attack was still unclear. "We cannot rule out that it is linked to terrorism but we can't confirm it either, but we are also investigating in this direction," he said. A meeting of the government's security cabinet will be held on Saturday. Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer is holding a crisis meeting with security advisers and the German Interior Minister, Thomas de Maiziere, who was on his way to the US, is returning home. Meanwhile the neighbouring Czech Republic is boosting its border security. More details have begun emerging about events at the shopping centre. Local resident Dominic Faust described how people entered the mall screaming. "Those people told us that there was a shooting outside and so the security closed the door of this mall and asked everybody to go upstairs to the fifth floor," he said. A man working at a petrol station in Munich earlier told the BBC: "We see just ambulances and firemen and police but all this area is evacuated, all the streets. "Now [there] are no cars just on the streets. All of the streets are blocked. The people are scared. Everybody is running around." Munich police said they did not know where "the perpetrators" were. "Look after yourselves and avoid public places". Police also urged people to help their operation by avoiding speculation and to desist from using photos or video of their deployments online. German security forces have been on alert since a teenage migrant stabbed and injured five people on a train in Bavaria on Monday, in an attack claimed by so-called Islamic State. The authorities had warned of the danger of further incidents. Are you in the area? Did you witness the shooting? You can email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk with your experiences.

It is among several new weapons systems featuring in a vast parade on 9 May. It is 70 years since the Soviet and Allied armies defeated Nazi Germany in 1945. The Russian defence ministry has posted photos of the new military hardware, taken during a rehearsal. Most Western leaders will not go to Moscow because of the Ukraine crisis. Russia's former World War Two allies - the UK, France and US - will be conspicuously absent from the event. The Red Square spectacle is expected to be the biggest military parade ever held. How big is the Moscow parade? 'Fully robotic' The Armata tank has an unmanned turret and a 125mm smooth-bore cannon that can fire guided missiles as well as shells. The three-man crew has better protection than in existing Russian tanks. They will be housed in a reinforced chamber, away from the main gun, Russian media report. Zvezda TV, a Russian defence ministry channel, says the tank's chassis is adaptable as a platform for other weapons systems. And Russia's RT news says the Armata could "evolve into a fully robotic battle vehicle". Its computer technology, speed and manoeuvrability are said to be far superior to those of the T-90, the current mainstay of the Russian army. Russia plans to bring in about 2,300 Armatas, starting in 2020, to replace Soviet-era tanks. Foreign snub Russia's annexation of Crimea and help for rebels in eastern Ukraine triggered Western sanctions, targeting senior government officials, defence industries and the energy sector. The Kremlin sent dozens of invitations to foreign leaders, but many will stay away from the 9 May parade. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel will not be there for 9 May, but will visit the following day. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier plans to travel to Volgograd - formerly Stalingrad - on 7 May. Nazi troops were defeated there in one of the bloodiest battles in history. Chinese and North Korean leaders will be among foreign dignitaries at the 9 May parade. Serbia - a candidate for EU membership - sent an elite guards unit to Moscow on Monday. They will be among several foreign contingents in the march-past. Greece's left-wing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras plans to attend the parade.
She entered hospital on Friday "for rest and some tests", her office said, after Closer magazine published images linking him to actress Julie Gayet. Mr Hollande did not deny the report but protested at invasion of his privacy. Conservative opposition leader Jean-Francois Cope has suggested the drama has damaged France's image abroad. 'Unpopular' Hollande Ms Trierweiler is expected to leave hospital on Monday, her office told AFP news agency. Political commentators have called on Mr Hollande to clarify her role as first lady. The French press has also been asking questions about the flat, just round the corner from the Elysee Palace, where the pair apparently met. It has been reported that it was borrowed by Ms Gayet from a friend, another actress, with links to the Corsican mafia. A presidential news conference scheduled for Tuesday on plans to boost the flagging economy now looks like being overshadowed by Mr Hollande's private life, correspondents say. Opinion polls already suggest he is the most unpopular president in a generation - one on Thursday indicated that only 25% of French people trusted him. The French media face strict privacy laws but the tradition of secrecy over the private lives of public figures has been steadily eroded in recent years. However, opinion polls suggest the French public appears to be averse to reporting politicians' private lives. According to an Ifop-JDD poll published on Sunday, three out of four French people believe the alleged affair is a private matter for the president. But with this dramatic twist affecting his official partner, it is increasingly hard to argue that these are personal matters which should not be under public scrutiny, says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris. Privacy debate On Friday, Closer magazine printed a seven-page article about the alleged affair between Mr Hollande and Ms Gayet. It was illustrated with photos showing a man said to be the president visiting a flat near the Elysee Palace at the same time as Ms Gayet. The man said to be the president is wearing a helmet and is ferried to and from the building on a moped. Mr Hollande threatened to sue over the report, which he called an "attack on the right to privacy", without denying the allegation. Allegations of the affair are not new. Ms Gayet lodged a complaint in March last year after a report of the liaison appeared online. In December, another actor, Stephane Guillon, teased her over Mr Hollande during a talk show to promote a new film. The same month, L'Express magazine reported mounting concern among presidential staff over the president's frequent "escapades", without giving details. Ms Trierweiler, who is a divorcee and mother of three children from an earlier marriage, is Mr Hollande's official partner and lives in a wing of the Elysee Palace. Mr Hollande, who has never married, left his previous partner and mother of his own four children - fellow Socialist politician Segolene Royal - to be with her. Mr Cope, leader of the centre-right UMP, said that while he was "very attached to respect for privacy", this recent incident was a "lesson in humility" for Mr Hollande. "All of this is disastrous for the image of the presidential function," he said on national TV. "You only have to read the international headlines."
The World Happiness Report measures "subjective well-being" - how happy the people are, and why. Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland and Finland round out the top five, while the Central African Republic came last. Western Europe and North America dominated the top of table, with the US and UK at 14th and 19th, respectively. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and those hit by conflict have predictably low scores. Syria placed 152 of 155 countries - Yemen and South Sudan, which are facing impending famine, came in at 146 and 147. The World Happiness Report was released to coincide with the United Nations' International Day of Happiness on 20 March. It mainly relies on asking a simple, subjective question of more than 1,000 people every year in more than 150 countries. "Imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom to 10 at the top," the question asks. "The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you personally feel you stand at this time?" The average result is the country's score - ranging from Norway's 7.54 to the Central African Republic's 2.69. But the report also tries to analyse statistics to explain why one country is happier than another. It looks at factors including economic strength (measured in GDP per capita), social support, life expectancy, freedom of choice, generosity, and perceived corruption. Can we all be as happy as Scandinavians? 'America's crisis' This year's report also contains a chapter titled "restoring American happiness", which examines why happiness levels in the United States are falling, despite constantly-increasing economic improvement. "The United States can and should raise happiness by addressing America's multi-faceted social crisis - rising inequality, corruption, isolation, and distrust - rather than focusing exclusively or even mainly on economic growth," the authors said. "America's crisis is, in short, a social crisis, not an economic crisis." Jeffrey Sachs, the director of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, which published the report, said President Donald Trump's policies were likely to make things worse. "They are all aimed at increasing inequality - tax cuts at the top, throwing people off the healthcare rolls, cutting Meals on Wheels in order to raise military spending. I think everything that has been proposed goes in the wrong direction," he told Reuters. The report also suggests that professional "white collar" jobs are associated with improved happiness over "blue collar" roles - but that having a job at all is one of the biggest factors. And while "those in well-paying jobs are happier and more satisfied with their lives", that effect has diminishing returns - "an extra $100 of salary is worth much more to someone at the lower end of the income distribution than someone already earning much more."

The latest figures show there were 70,000 people out of work between December 2017 and February 2018, which is 3,000 fewer than the previous quarter, and 4,000 fewer than a year earlier. The Welsh unemployment rate fell by 0.3 percentage point over the past year. The UK rate fell 0.1 percentage point from the previous quarter to 4.2%. Figures released last month put the Welsh unemployment rate at 4.8%. The employment rate for people aged 16-64 was down 0.1 percentage point at 73% compared with 12 months ago. The rate of economic inactivity increased slightly over the year by 0.3 percentage point to 23.4%. This looks at the number of people between 16 and 64 not actively looking for work because they are full-time students, carers, early retirees or long-term sick and they are not counted in the unemployment rate. Wales' unemployment rate is lower than London, Yorkshire/Humberside, West Midlands and north-east England, according to the information published by the Office for National Statistics. The unemployment rate in both south-east England and south-west England was 3.4%. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: "While there is still a lot of work to do, I am confident we will build on this encouraging picture as employers continue to seek out our skilled workforce and great venues for investment".
About 85,000 German-language copies of the anti-Semitic Nazi manifesto have been sold. Publisher Andreas Wirsching said "the figures overwhelmed us". He is director of the Institute of Contemporary History (IfZ) in Munich. But the sales are well below those of best-sellers in Germany. It is an academic edition, costing €58 (£49). At the end of January the IfZ will launch a sixth print run. The book contains critical notes by scholars. Unlike the Nazi-era editions, the IfZ's Mein Kampf (My Struggle) has a plain white cover - without a picture of Hitler. The swastika and other Nazi symbols are banned in Germany. Mr Wirsching told the German news agency DPA that the IfZ was planning a shorter, French-language edition. "But two-thirds of our commentaries will be translated" for it, he said. The first print run in Germany in 2016 was 4,000 copies. Life of Adolf Hitler Austria MPs vote to seize Hitler's house Himmler diaries show daily Nazi horrors Living with a Nazi name The decision to republish the inflammatory book was criticised by Jewish groups. Mein Kampf was originally printed in 1925 - eight years before Hitler came to power. It sets out racist ideas that the Nazis put into practice later, including the denigration and oppression of Jews and Slavs. 'Not a runaway hit' - the BBC's Damien McGuinness in Berlin writes: The fact that the Nazi manifesto reached number one in Der Spiegel's non-fiction charts in April is cited as evidence that Adolf Hitler's propaganda is making a comeback in Germany. But the term "best-seller" does not necessarily mean very much. A quarter of all books sold in Germany are bought in the run-up to Christmas. At other times of the year it is possible to top listings with relatively few sales. Mein Kampf (My Struggle) is an expensive academic text, and is being bought by libraries, schools and history academics. For a German non-fiction book sales of 85,000 are not bad. But the figures don't indicate a runaway hit. The current biggest non-fiction seller is The Hidden Life of Trees, a book about the ecosystem of woodland, which has sold half a million copies so far. Read Damien's analysis in full here. After Nazi Germany was defeated in 1945, the Allied forces handed the copyright to the state of Bavaria. Under German law copyright lasts for 70 years. While the Bavarian regional government held the copyright, reprinting of the book was banned. But the copyright expired a year ago. Mr Wirsching said he favoured "clever" teachers using the IfZ edition in the classroom. He warned against "repeating the absurd 1950s discussion, when people said 'it was all Hitler's fault'." He said the IfZ had obtained solid legal advice before republishing the book on a limited scale. And the scholarly edition was aimed partly at pre-empting any editions put out by Nazi sympathisers. "It would be irresponsible to just let this text spread arbitrarily," he told DPA.
By Carrie GracieBBC China editor Under the existing terms of the £18bn project, a Chinese company is to finance a third of the new Hinkley Point C reactors and may later build a Chinese-designed nuclear power station in Essex. So what's the difference between a French company and a Chinese one when it comes to the UK's critical infrastructure? How you answer that question depends on your assessment of China and its intentions. This is a fiendishly difficult calculation. China is a moving target, and a huge, contradictory and complex one at that. In 2016 it is already not the country that David Cameron faced when he became prime minister six years ago. and not the China that former George Osborne set out to woo for investment in the UK's infrastructure upgrade. Beijing is more powerful and its global agenda more assertive. At home, its political crackdown puts it increasingly at odds with British values. Should any of this matter? The UK already has a Chinese company, Huawei, running key parts of its telecommunications network. Arguably nuclear energy is likewise a business relationship subject to similar national security safeguards. But led by the United States, several other western countries have barred Huawei's involvement in key telecommunications networks on national security grounds. And no other major developed economy has invited Chinese involvement in a key nuclear energy project. 'Fear and greed' Two years ago the German Chancellor Angela Merkel asked her Australian counterpart what drove his country's policy on China, and he answered "fear and greed". In the absence of political change in China, this blunt assessment sums up the calculus for many countries, though the exact proportions of each differ depending on circumstance. Some in the British political and security establishment felt that under the previous government's declared "golden era" with China, there was not enough fear in London and too much greed. One such was the prime minister's joint chief of staff Nick Timothy. In comments which have received enormous scrutiny since Thursday night's surprise announcement that the Hinkley Point deal would be delayed, Mr Timothy wrote last October on the eve of the Chinese president's state visit to the UK: "Security experts - reportedly inside as well as outside government - are worried that the Chinese could use their role to build weaknesses into computer systems which will allow them to shut down Britain's energy production at will… "MI5 believes that 'the intelligence services of… China… continue to work against UK interests at home and abroad'." Is Mrs May worried? According to the former Business Secretary Vince Cable, the then home secretary did raise national security concerns about the Hinkley Point deal in cabinet. Sir Vince described Mrs May as "unhappy about the rather gung-ho approach to Chinese investment that we had, and that George Osborne in particular was promoting and, as I recall, raised objections to Hinkley at that time". Interestingly, Mrs May's less "gung ho" attitude on China was already evident in another dimension. As home secretary, she intervened personally when it emerged that the dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei had been granted only a 20-day visa to launch his exhibition at London's Royal Academy. Ms May overturned that decision, ordered a six-month visa and apologised to Mr Ai. So perhaps we will see a more nuanced policy to China under this new government. But this, too, is hard to get right. Some in the business and political community will remind Mrs May that her predecessor learned early what it was to feel Beijing's wrath when he ignored Chinese protests and met the Dalai Lama in 2012. As a result, no senior figure in the British government was invited to China for the following 18 months - and when Mr Cameron did finally visit, it was after George Osborne had wrested control of UK-China policy from the more cautious Foreign Office to launch what he called "the next big step", a very business-oriented relationship which culminated in President Xi's state visit to the UK last October. It's worth remembering that the Hinkley Point deal was the centrepiece of that visit, the symbol of the "golden era" in relations that both governments hoped to launch. And Beijing has good reason for investing political capital in the nuclear energy relationship. China has more than 30 nuclear power stations at home and nearly as many under construction. Exporting its nuclear technology is now the priority, and although it has customers like Pakistan in the developing world, the UK's track record and internationally respected safety regime would make it a hugely valuable showcase. The price of making China angry China's embassy in London said on Saturday that Chinese involvement in Hinkley Point is a "win-win", and UK enthusiasts insists Chinese technology is cheap and safe and that China has too much at stake to want to "shut down Britain's energy production at will", as Mr Timothy put it. But if at the end of her review, Mrs May does decide she's unsure about future Chinese intentions and wants to renegotiate, what will happen? Could she have Chinese investment for Hinkley Point without any strings attached about a Chinese-designed and built nuclear power station down the line? At this point, we just don't know, but one answer may be no, and if she then walks away, she risks making China angry. Now that would cause problems for another stated government goal. Mrs May is only prime minister because of the Brexit vote, and in a world where the UK stands outside the European Union, it may want to work harder at its economic relationship China. Last weekend, Chancellor Philip Hammond was in Beijing and raised the possibility of a free trade agreement. If Chinese pique over a reverse on nuclear energy landed the British government back on what many in Whitehall called China's "naughty step", trade negotiations would go into the freezer and howls of protest would follow from those in the business community who were hoping to realise Mr Osborne's "golden decade" in economic relations. It's possible that Mrs May won't get to this point in her reassessment, but if she does, she may reflect that if China is minded to exact a price for a change of heart on a business deal, the price for other differences of opinion might become unacceptably high if the same China was in control of a British nuclear power station. Which then brings the prime minister to the question of how other world leaders manage difficulties in their relationship with China. Size and strategic dominance puts the United States in a different class, but there's an interesting model closer to home. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel manages to have a close and profitable business relationship with Beijing at the same time as being much more robust in defence of German interests, and much more vocal on other issues like China's territorial assertiveness and its crackdown on human rights and freedom of speech. In Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne, Chinese leaders have grown used to British partners who kept most differences behind closed doors, whether on steel dumping, Hong Kong, locking up lawyers or the South China Sea. It would be an ironic twist if one result of the Brexit vote was a reset of UK China policy which put that policy back in line with its more robust EU partners. China's calculus A month ago, Brexit looked like one set of problems for China, mostly focused on economic fears. Now with her Hinkley Point pause, Ms May has delivered a wholly new set of problems. But while Chinese leaders may not like the unpredictable and inconvenient U-turns in policy and style that come with messy democracies, they are increasingly adept at handling them. From the United States to Sri Lanka and Myanmar, Beijing plays a long and pragmatic game when it comes to new governments. So China liked the Cameron-Osborne team and got used to the chancellor calling the tune on UK-China policy. But with this signal that key decision making has moved from No 11 to No 10 Downing St, Beijing will be working hard to map the players in the May team, and when the prime minister finishes her assessment of the Hinkley Point deal and announces the outcome, you can be sure Beijing will be ready for her.
By Carrie GracieBBC China editor 'Trump confirms socialism is the way' A week is just a week, but when it comes to strategic focus, China is on course. It's easier to look laser sharp when the competition is in disarray. Here the internal difficulties of the US and the European Union are helpful to China. As Chinese Foreign Ministry official Zhang Jun put it in a discussion with foreign journalists: "If people want to say China has taken a position of leadership, it's not because China suddenly thrust itself forward as a leader. It's because the original front-runners suddenly fell back and pushed China to the front." In the past week alone, a bitter row over the size of the crowd at the Trump inauguration, followed by street protests the next day, underlined the divisions of the world's superpower even at the very moment which was supposed to heal. For China's citizens, brought up to see street protests as dangerous, this was another symptom of dysfunction in a political system they've been taught to distrust. And next, an American president echoed Beijing's message that the mainstream American media can't be trusted. So it's been a week to put a spring in the step of China's communists, to shake off the inferiority complex of an autocratic political system, and even to advance the claim that China's system is superior. Among business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, President Xi talked the language of global togetherness, but back home his Communist Party's flagship newspaper, the People's Daily, lost no time in declaring the bankruptcy of Western politics. "The emergence of capitalism's social crisis is the most updated evidence to show the superiority of socialism and Marxism," it said. This ideological inoculation is invaluable for Xi Jinping ahead of the vital Communist Party Congress which will clarify China's leadership line-up for the next five years. What's more, greater political confidence at home allows him to focus out. The inauguration of a billionaire celebrity promising to make America great again through building walls confirms the view of some in Beijing that the United States is in terminal decline, and that this is a moment of opportunity for China. President Xi's favourite slogans are the "China Dream" and the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese people". But it's all happening faster than his predecessors could have imagined. It's less than two decades since China fully entered a US-led world of global capitalism. When China joined the World Trade Organization, it complained bitterly about living under rules made by the US and its friends, while fully expecting to live under those rules for decades to come. But November's American presidential election finished what the 2008 financial crisis had begun: a shift in worldview. And now we are one week into the new leadership mission set out by President Xi at Davos. In comparison, Xi Jinping looks balanced A word about character. In China there are some who compare Mr Trump's character and leadership style with China's Chairman Mao. They point to the former's relentless tweeting as a new version of the latter's daily deluge of quotations. They note other similarities: the unpredictability, distrust of media, and overwhelming self-confidence. Some admire and some despise, but Donald Trump, they say, is a great disrupter in the Maoist mould. All of which is a discussion which takes some of the heat off President Xi at home. Until recently critics accused him of Maoist tendencies after his relentless concentration of titles and power and his frenetic media personality cult. But as China's citizens look out on a world of strongmen this week, their own president may seem comparatively sober, predictable and experienced: not too much the Caesar, nor too little, for a global leader in our age. China becomes the voice of globalisation Meanwhile Mr Xi's outward facing message, that China wants a world of fair trade and globalisation, got a boost this week from several quarters, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB). The Chinese-led development bank said it is set for expansion. It currently has nearly 60 members and now says another 25 are likely to join this year. Two years ago when the AIIB was launched, it became a symbol of the pulling power of China's money and nimble diplomacy when US allies lined up to join despite strong US opposition. This week, AIIB president Jin Liqun told journalists, it was China's turn to contribute to the world: "China needs to do something that can help it be recognised as a responsible leader." But in the long view, if this week is to be remembered as a tipping point towards Chinese power, it will not be because of anything announced in Beijing but because of what happens in Washington. One of President Trump's first acts in office was to sign an executive order withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact which the Obama administration had insisted would cement US leadership in Asia. "Protection will lead to greater strength", said Mr Trump. But in an open letter, outgoing US ambassadors in the region disagreed. "Walking away from TPP may be seen by future generations as the moment America chose to cede leadership to others in this part of the world and accept a diminished role." Certainly in response to the Trump announcement, US ally and TPP signatory Australia immediately said it hoped to recast the trade agreement without the US, and said China might be invited to join. China remains unchallenged in Asia... Asia is the key testing ground where the US stands in the way of China's ambitions. Since the end of World War Two, Washington has insisted that the US is in Asia for the good of all and invested decades in diplomacy and defence to maintain the liberal international order. On the campaign trail, Mr Trump expressed impatience with that investment. And having withdrawn from the TPP, the Trump administration will have to find a new way to nurture key allies and partners in the region and to reassure them that 'America first' does not mean everyone else last. But at the same moment, China's diplomats and bankers are stepping up their efforts and their focus does not waver. Last year, Beijing turned an international legal defeat over the South China Sea into a diplomatic triumph by charming and disarming the Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. In the Trump era, it has other US allies in its sights. Only this week, Thailand confirmed funding for the purchase of a Chinese submarine. ... and not afraid to defend itself But on security, the week also saw a cloud on China's leadership horizon. The new White House spokesman Sean Spicer seemed to echo warnings to China from incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson when he sketched out a position on the South China Sea. "We're going to make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country," said Mr Spicer. It's not clear exactly what he meant or exactly what Mr Tillerson meant, but a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman immediately restated China's claim to sovereignty in the region, and insisted that Beijing would be resolute in defending its own rights and interests. If the Trump administration is to push back against China in the South China Sea it will need support from US allies who ask themselves whether Mr Trump has the strategic focus necessary for such a risky undertaking. China will naturally encourage those doubts given its preference for making domination of the South China Sea a fait accompli with as little fuss as possible. But there are many players, many unpredictable variables and many wrong moves in this game. One week into the new world order, China's leaders may feel some things are playing into their hand. But it will be many months, perhaps years, before they can judge whether China's global gamble is a win against Trump's America.
The books date from 1925 and 1926 and were purchased by an anonymous US buyer, auctioneer Nate Sanders said. Hitler inscribed the cloth-bound volumes, one a first edition and the other a second, to Josef Bauer, an early Nazi party member and SS officer. The Nazi leader offered Bauer his best wishes in the Christmas season. The online bidding started at $20,000 and concluded on Thursday night. The books received 11 bids. Written by Hitler while he was jailed for his role in a 1923 failed putsch attempt, Mein Kampf (My Struggle) rails against Judaism and communism. The two volumes were published in 1925 and 1926, before Hitler became chancellor of Germany. "I think it's very heinous," Mr Sanders, who identified himself as Jewish, told a local television station. "But it is an auction item, it is a memento, it's a piece of memorabilia, and a piece of history."
The White House said the move was a response to "Russia's continued illegal intervention in Ukraine". Those targeted include Igor Sechin, head of oil giant Rosneft, and Sergei Chemezov of the hi-tech firm Rostec. The announcement comes after the mayor of Kharkiv, a city in eastern Ukraine, was shot and critically wounded. Hennadiy Kernes was recovering after an operation to repair damage to the chest and abdomen, but his life remained in danger, his office said. Mr Kernes used to be a supporter of former pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. He then dropped his support for Mr Yanukovych in favour of a united Ukraine. Monday also saw pro-Russian separatists seize a local government building in Kostyantynivka, a town in the eastern Donetsk region. In Donetsk itself, pro-Russian activists armed with clubs and chains attacked a pro-unity rally. A number of people were injured in the clash. Western countries accuse Russia of actively supporting the activists in Eastern Ukraine - a claim denied by Moscow. Separatists were also continuing to detain about 40 people in the town of Sloviansk, including journalists, pro-Kiev activists and seven military observers linked to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) as well as three members of Ukraine's security service, officials in Kiev said. At an OSCE meeting in Vienna, Russian ambassador Andrei Kelin said Moscow was taking "steps" to secure the observers' release. But the area around Sloviansk was very tense and it had been "extremely irresponsible" to send them there, he added. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon later called for the immediate and unconditional release of the observers. Separately, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu in a phone call with his US counterpart Chuck Hagel said Russian troops had returned to their permanent positions after conducting military exercises on the border with Ukraine. But he did not say whether the overall number of Russian troops deployed in the region - said to be around 40,000 - had been reduced. Meanwhile, Mr Hagel warned that Russia's continued aggression would result in more diplomatic and economic pressure. 'Additional costs' The US and EU first imposed visa bans and asset freezes on a number of senior Russian officials and companies after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine last month. On Thursday, the White House said it was adding to its sanctions list "in response to Russia's continued illegal intervention in Ukraine and provocative acts that undermine Ukraine's democracy". It accused Russia of "doing nothing to meet the commitments it made" at a meeting with Ukraine, the US and EU in Geneva on 17 April, which it said had included refraining from violence or provocative acts. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow's response would be "painful for Washington". He told the Interfax news agency the Kremlin was "disgusted" by the sanctions. Among the seven government officials facing a US asset freeze and visa ban, two are seen as long-time allies: Most of the 17 companies targeted are linked to Arkady and Boris Rotenberg and Gennady Timchenko - individuals targeted in the previous sanctions list. The latest measures also targets some hi-tech exports that "could contribute to Russia's military capabilities". Meanwhile, diplomats in Brussels said EU governments had reached a preliminary agreement to impose similar sanctions on another 15 people as part of expanded sanctions against Russia. The names are expected to be released on Tuesday.
By Victoria GillScience reporter, BBC News Wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic revealed an "emerging trend" of making and smuggling beads, bracelets and bangles and rhino horn powder. The lead investigator told BBC News the trade in rhino horn was now "morphing" into a market for luxury items. At least 7,100 rhinos are estimated to have been killed in Africa since 2007. Today, about 25,000 of the animals remain. Julian Rademeyer from Traffic explained that the production of rhino horn "trinkets" mirrored some of the patterns seen in the trade in ivory. "It's very worrying," he told BBC News. "Because if someone's walking through the airport wearing a necklace made of rhino horn, who is going to stop them? "Police are looking for a piece of horn and whole horns." Status symbol The primary destinations for smuggled rhino horn remain the same; the largest markets are in China and Vietnam. But this investigation also found that smuggling routes constantly changed and adapted, becoming more complex in order to avoid countries and airports where law enforcement resources were being focused. This shift in how horn is processed before it is moved could make it more difficult to detect. "This is quite a preliminary assessment," explained Mr Rademeyer, "but it's vital that there's information sharing about these new trends - particularly with law enforcement." He added that the market for medicinal rhino horn - believed by many to be a cure for a range of illnesses, from rheumatism to cancer - seemed to have "reduced somewhat". But owning rhino horn - particularly for wealthy men in Vietnam - is also seen as a status symbol. "It's about power - about showing off your wealth," said Mr Rademeyer. "It's been called the Ferrari factor - having something says you are wealthy and that you're untouchable [by the law]." Susie Offord-Woolley, managing director of the charity Save the Rhino International, said this kind of information was "essential" in order that law enforcement officers could be trained to identify rhino horn jewellery. "The fact they're carving [the horn] up now means these gangs are getting more concerned about security, and that's a good sign," she added. At the current rate of poaching, Save the Rhino says that rhinos could be extinct in the wild within the next 10 years. "That's what we're all trying to avoid," said Ms Offord-Woolley. And while this is a fight to save a species, she added, "this also affects so many people". She added: "In last 10 years, 1,000 rangers have been killed in Africa while on patrol protecting rhinos. "So this is an issue for people's lives, as well." Follow Victoria on Twitter
In September last year he told fans that he had decided to run for the White House in 2020. Speaking exclusively to Radio 1's Annie Mac he has given more details about his plans and motivation. But the rapper says he doesn't have views on politics, just "a view on humanity, on people, on the truth". He tells the DJ that he just wants to bring about positive change in America if he can. "If there is anything that I can do with my time and my day, to somehow make a difference while I'm alive I'm going to try to do it." He speaks about the current political situation in the States and the recent string of police shootings against unarmed black Americans. "We are numb, we're numb to 500 kids getting killed in Chicago a year," Kanye tells Annie. "We're numb to the fact that it was seven police shootings in the beginning of July." The deaths have sparked the Black Lives Matter movement. People have often speculated that he initially made the announcement that he wanted to be president for publicity or on the spur of the moment. However, he's always insisted that he is totally serious about running in 2020. In the past he said he's had lots of support since announcing his plans to stand. The interview will be broadcast on Monday 1 August 19:00-21:00 BST on Radio 1 Find us on Instagram at BBCNewsbeat and follow us on Snapchat, search for bbc_newsbeat
"What is it like to request a last meal before you are executed for a crime that you may or may not have committed?" asks the American photographer in an art statement on the project. "If we can place ourselves in front of that meal, perhaps we can feel the experience. "Maybe we can question our own motives and complicity with the justice system.

"[There are a] couple of matters I want to talk about since this is one of the few times people will listen to what I have to say. The United States has gotten [to a place] now where [there is] zero respect for human life. My death is just a symptom of a bigger illness. At some point, the government has got to wake up and stop doing things to destroy other countries and killing innocent children. The ongoing embargo and sanctions against places like Iran and Iraq, Cuba and other places - they are not doing anything to change the world and they are hurting innocent children. "Perhaps more important in a lot of ways is what we are doing to the environment is even more devastating because as long as we keep going the direction we're going the end result is it won't matter how we treat other people because everybody on the planet will be on their way out. "One of the few ways in the world the truth is ever going to get out, or people are ever going to know what's happening, [is] as long as we support a free press out there. I see the press struggling to stay existent as a free institution." Last Meals is at the Parrish Art Museum, in New York, until 31 January 2021. All photographs subject to copyright.
Mr Liu, a human rights campaigner, was jailed in 2009 on subversion charges for calling for greater democracy. His lawyer says he is being treated in hospital in northern Liaoning Province after being diagnosed a month ago. His wife Liu Xia has been under house arrest since her husband won the award in 2010 but has never been charged. Liu Xiaobo, 61, was a key leader in the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. The Chinese authorities have never explained why they have restricted his wife's movements. Mr Liu's brother confirmed the Nobel laureate had been diagnosed with cancer on 23 May, his lawyer Mo Shaoping told the South China Morning Post. He was released days later and is now being treated in the northern city of Shenyang. "He has no special plans. He is just receiving medical treatment for his illness," Mo Shaoping told AFP news agency. A statement from the government in Liaoning said Mr Liu had been released on medical parole and was being treated by eight tumour experts. Fighting for change from within - Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Beijing Most people in China have never heard of Liu Xiaobo due to the censorship of discussion about him here. That it could take a month for news of his release to become public gives you an idea of the level of sensitivity. It also shows that his transfer to hospital by no means guarantees his friends and family will be able to visit. After the brutal crackdown in and around Tiananmen Square in 1989 Mr Liu was driven to the front gate of the Australian embassy and an Australian diplomat said that he had to choose in or out. He decided not to leave, believing he could be more effective trying to make change from within. This commitment to a very different China has led to him paying a terrible price. The Nobel committee described Liu Xiaobo as "the foremost symbol" of the human rights struggle in China. He never collected his prize and was represented by an empty chair. The Chinese government, which regards him as a criminal, was infuriated by the award. Diplomatic ties with Norway were frozen. Relations were normalised only last December. Mr Liu has three years left to serve of an 11-year sentence for "inciting subversion" after drafting Charter 08 - which called for multi-party democracy and respect for human rights in China. Amnesty International said he should never have been jailed. It urged China to ensure he received "adequate medical care, effective access to his family and that he and all others imprisoned solely for exercising their human rights are immediately and unconditionally released".
Crowds of pro-Moscow voters celebrated in the main city of Simferopol, and Crimea's pro-Russia leader said he would apply to join Russia on Monday. But many Crimeans loyal to Kiev boycotted the referendum, and the EU and US condemned it as illegal. Pro-Russian forces took control of Crimea in February after Ukraine's pro-Moscow president was overthrown. On the ballot paper, voters were asked whether they would like Crimea to rejoin Russia. A second question asked whether Crimea should return to its status under the 1992 constitution, which would give the region much greater autonomy. There was no option for those who wanted the constitutional situation to remain unchanged. Ethnic Russians make up 58.5% of the region's population, and many of them were expected to vote for joining Russia. One voter, Olga Koziko, told the BBC that she was voting for secession because she did not want to be governed by "those Nazis who came to power in Kiev". "Russia will defend us and protect us," the schoolteacher said. There are 1.5 million eligible voters and election officials put the turnout in Sunday's vote at more than 80%. Ethnic Tatars, who make up 12% of the population, mostly boycotted the election. Sergei Aksyonov, who was installed as Crimea's regional government leader after Russia's military takeover, said a session of parliament would take place on Monday. "The Supreme Soviet of Crimea will make an official application for the republic to join the Russian Federation at a meeting on March 17," he said on Twitter after the vote. But White House spokesman Jay Carney condemned the vote as "dangerous and destabilising" and said it would have "increasing costs for Russia". The US has previously threatened to impose sanctions on Russia. The European Union said the vote was "illegal and illegitimate and its outcome will not be recognised". EU foreign ministers are due to meet on Monday and are expected to consider imposing sanctions on Russian officials. Away from the Crimea region, unrest continued in the south-east Ukrainian city of Donetsk. Pro-Russian protesters stormed the prosecutor's building shouting "Donetsk is a Russian city", and then broke into the local security services headquarters for the second time in two days. They later dispersed but promised to return on Monday. The protesters are demanding that the prosecutor release a pro-Russian leader, Pavel Gubarev. The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had told German Chancellor Angela Merkel by phone he was concerned by escalating tensions in Donetsk, blaming "radical groups" which had the consent of Kiev. Mr Putin told Mrs Merkel that Sunday's referendum was legal and Moscow would respect the result. The German chancellor's spokesman said she had proposed expanding the presence of international observers from the OSCE in eastern Ukraine and that Mr Putin had welcomed the plan. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk warned that the authorities would track down separatist "ringleaders". "We will find all of them - if it takes one year, two years - and bring them to justice and try them in Ukrainian and international courts," he said. In other developments: Russia on Saturday vetoed a draft UN resolution criticising the vote - the only Security Council member to vote against it. Moscow's main ally China abstained, ensuring Russia's isolation. The Crimean region was part of Russia until 1954 and Russia's Black Sea fleet is based in Ukrainian ports. But Moscow has signed agreements promising to uphold Ukraine's territorial integrity.
Mayor Bill de Blasio said all visitors would be ordered to stay for 14 days at the address they provided on arrival. He said anyone arriving from the UK would be visited by sheriff's deputies to ensure they abide by the rules. Those who breach them will be fined $1,000 (£737) a day, Mr de Blasio warned. About 18.4m coronavirus cases and more than 326,000 deaths have been recorded across the US, according to Johns Hopkins University. New York City was at the epicentre of America's coronavirus outbreak earlier this year, and has again become one of the country's worst-affected states. In a statement, Mayor de Blasio said all inbound international travellers must provide their contact details. "We are really serious about the fact that if you violate quarantine you're creating a danger for everyone else," said Mr de Blasio. "We are in the final battle here, all we have to do is get through these holidays," he added. Dozens of countries - including nearly all 27 EU states - have already imposed restrictions on travel from the UK, as governments clamp down on the spread of coronavirus over the Christmas period. What are the new Covid-19 variants? This week UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson revealed that a new strain of coronavirus was behind a surge in cases in the country. Then on Wednesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said yet another variant - originating in South Africa - had been detected in the country. The two variants are still being analysed, but the government said it was confident that both are more easily transmittable than other strains. But the UK government said its new, tougher lockdown measures would help to contain the spread. What's the latest in the US? America continues to report the world's highest total cases and Covid-related deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. In all, about 5% of the US population are known to have been infected since the pandemic began. Daily cases have been at record levels since early November, and many states are overwhelmed with hospitalisation numbers. US regulators have recently approved two vaccines - one by Moderna, and another by Pfizer and BioNTech - and over 9.4 million doses have been shipped nationwide, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The government has also signed a deal with Pfizer to buy an additional 100 million doses of the its vaccine. But last week, a US general in charge of distributing the jabs apologised after many states learned they would be receiving fewer vaccines than expected. As of Wednesday, over one million Americans had had their first jab, the CDC said. Earlier this year, the government pledged to inoculate 20 million people by the end of 2020.
As slides of the paintings were shown at a news conference, an expert said the works had been seized from private individuals or institutions. Previously unregistered works by Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Max Liebermann and Henri Matisse were found. Prosecutors said the issue of ownership was still being clarified. The total value has been estimated at about 1bn euros (£846m; $1.35bn). Reinhard Nemetz, head of the prosecutors' office in Augsburg, said that 121 framed and 1,285 unframed works had been seized in the flat of Cornelius Gurlitt in Munich in March of last year. It was not yet clear if any offence had been committed, he added, stressing that the legal position was extremely complex. Investigators, he said, had turned up "concrete evidence" that at least some of the works had been seized by the Nazis from their owners or had been deemed "degenerate". Art expert Meike Hoffmann said some of the works were dirty but they had not been damaged. 'Extraordinarily good' "When you stand before the works and see again these long-lost, missing works, that were believed destroyed, seeing them in quite good condition, it's an extraordinarily good feeling," Ms Hoffmann said. "The pictures are of exceptional quality, and have very special value for art experts. Many works were unknown until now." Other artists whose works were found include Pablo Picasso and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, as well as Canaletto and Gustave Courbet. The paintings were found in March of last year after Mr Gurlitt was investigated for tax evasion. The framed pictures were stacked on a shelf, like in a museum storeroom while the unframed works were piled up in drawers, said customs official Siegfried Kloeble. According to a report by Germany's Focus magazine, Mr Gurlitt, the reclusive son of an art dealer in Munich, would occasionally sell a picture when he needed money. "We don't have any strong suspicion of a crime that would justify an arrest," said Mr Nemetz, adding that the current whereabouts of Mr Gurlitt were unknown. Asked at the news conference why the German authorities had taken so long to reveal the paintings, the prosecutor said it would have been "counter-productive to go public" with the case earlier. Mr Kloeble refused to say where the artworks were being stored. Mr Gurlitt's father Hildebrand collected early 20th Century art regarded by the Nazis as un-German or "degenerate", and removed from show in state museums. He was recruited by the Nazis to sell the "degenerate art" abroad but also bought privately. After the war he told investigators that his collection had been destroyed during the Allied bombing of Dresden in 1945. He also said he had been persecuted himself for having a Jewish grandmother. Resuming his work as a dealer, he died in a car crash in 1956. A Jewish group has questioned the length of time it took Germany to unveil the artworks and called for them to be returned to their original owners. "It cannot be, as in this case, that what amounts morally to the concealment of stolen goods continues," said Ruediger Mahlo, speaking for the Conference on Jewish material claims against Germany. 'Justice denied' Stuart Eizenstat, a former US ambassador to the EU, told the BBC that time was running out, and the details of the artworks should be published. "Victims of the Holocaust are aging, even the families of those who did not survive are of an age," he said. "It's important that this be publicised. But the longer one goes... the more difficult it is for people to prepare potential claims... Justice delayed is justice denied." However, prosecutors say it would not be proper procedure to put things on the internet and people who want to make a claim should contact them directly. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Munich says that descendants of owners of art taken by German forces in occupied Europe may be able to make claims. However, there are suggestions that art taken in Germany itself may not be reclaimable because of a 30-year statute of limitations. Mr Mahlo said that private collections of such art under the Third Reich had been almost all Jewish. However, auctioneers have argued that at least some of the works were purchased cheaply in 1938 by Mr Gurlitt's father from a collection of state-owned art. In 1990, Cornelius Gurlitt auctioned works for 38,250 Swiss francs (31,000 euros) in Galerie Kornfeld, an auction house and gallery in the Swiss city of Bern. In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, Galerie Kornfeld said: "Cornelius Gurlitt inherited the works after the death of his mother Helene. Basically this is a case of undeclared inheritance."
By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent Andrew Parker was making his first public speech since taking over as head of the UK Security Service in April. Al-Qaeda and its affiliates in Pakistan and Yemen present "the most direct and immediate threats to the UK," he said. He also warned of the damage done to British security by the leaking of classified documents from GCHQ. Addressing the Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall, Mr Parker added the security services must have access to the many means of communication which terrorists now use. He also revealed some of the fears and frustrations his service was experiencing over both the advances in technology, and those who leak government secrets into the public domain. 'Enormous damage' Intelligence officials in both the US and Britain have been absolutely dismayed at the wealth of secret data taken by the former CIA contractor Edward Snowden when he fled to Russia. Some 58,000 of the files are from GCHQ, whose intelligence, Mr Parker said, had played a vital role in stopping many UK terrorist plots over the past decade. Without mentioning Mr Snowden by name, he said ''it causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of GCHQ techniques". Doing this, he added, handed the advantage to the terrorists. He warned that terrorists now had tens of thousands of means of communication "through e-mail, IP telephony, in-game communication, social networking, chat rooms, anonymising services and a myriad of mobile apps". Mr Parker said it was vital for MI5 - and by inference its partner GCHQ - to retain the capability to access such information if the Security Service was to protect the country. However, some have argued that Snowden's revelations, which were published in the Guardian newspaper, have not harmed Britain and, in fact, opened a debate on the balance between privacy and security. Henry Porter, a columnist with that newspaper's sister title the Observer, said: "The people who released and let go of these documents, of course, were the NSA in America. "That's where the leak took place and we haven't published anything which jeopardised the security of this country." In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: "What we have done is shown how much surveillance we are under; legitimately under the laws that have been passed by this government." A Guardian News & Media spokesman said: "A huge number of people - from President Obama to the US Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper - have now conceded that the Snowden revelations have prompted a debate which was both necessary and overdue. "The President has even set up a review panel and there have been vigorous discussions in the US Congress and throughout Europe "Such a debate is only worthwhile if it is informed. That is what journalism should do." 'Not perfect' But Mr Parker warned that threats to the UK are growing more diverse and diffuse. And he warned: "It remains the case that there are several thousand Islamist extremists here who see the British public as a legitimate target." He explained that "knowing of an individual does not equate to knowing everything about them". "Being on our radar does not necessarily mean being under our microscope," he said. "The reality of intelligence work in practice is that we only focus the most intense intrusive attention on a small number of cases at any one time. "The challenge therefore concerns making choices between multiple and competing demands to give us the best chance of being in the right place at the right time to prevent terrorism." Mr Parker added: "We are not perfect, and there are always things we can learn, do better and sharpen up on." With 30 years in MI5, Mr Parker was previously deputy director general and before that director of its counter-terrorism division at the time of the London bombings in 2005. 'Stopped at airports' In his speech, he named al-Qaeda and its affiliates in south Asia and the Arabian peninsula as presenting "the most direct and immediate threats to the UK". By that he meant primarily its elements in Pakistan and separately in Yemen, from where al-Qaeda has three times succeeded in smuggling explosives past security on to planes in the last four years. Referring to the ongoing conflict in Syria, he said a growing proportion of MI5's casework concerned individuals from the UK who had travelled to fight there. He said extremist Sunni groups in Syria were aspiring to attack Western countries. This has long been a concern of Western governments - that British-based jihadists will one day return from the killing fields of Syria and turn their new-found skills on the population back home. A number of people have been stopped at airports and some have been arrested on suspicion of terrorism. "For the future, there is good reason to be concerned about Syria," he said. Mr Parker said 330 people had been convicted of terrorism-related offences in Britain between 11 September 2001 and 31 March 2013. He added that in the first few months of this year, there had been four major trials related to terrorist plots. Chillingly, he reminded the public that these included plans for a 7/7-style attack with rucksack bombs, and named two other plots. There were guilty pleas in each case, he said, with 24 terrorists convicted and sentenced to more than 260 years in jail. In conclusion, Mr Parker said he did not believe the terrorist threat was any worse now than before. But it was "more diffuse, more complicated, more unpredictable".
By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News A team at New York University trawled the internet to find the most common claims about a good night's kip. Then, in a study published in the journal Sleep Health, they matched the claims to the best scientific evidence. They hope that dispelling sleep myths will improve people's physical and mental health and well-being. So, how many are you guilty of? Myth 1 - You can cope on less than five hours' sleep This is the myth that just won't go away. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously had a brief four hours a night. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has made similar claims, and swapping hours in bed for extra time in the office is not uncommon in tales of business or entrepreneurial success. Yet the researchers said the belief that less than five hours' shut-eye was healthy, was one of the most damaging myths to health. "We have extensive evidence to show sleeping five hours or less consistently, increases your risk greatly for adverse health consequences," said researcher Dr Rebecca Robbins. These included cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attacks and strokes, and shorter life expectancy. Instead, she recommends everyone should aim for a consistent seven to eight hours of sleep a night. Thatcher: Can people get by on four hours' sleep? Myth 2 - Alcohol before bed boosts your sleep The relaxing nightcap is a myth, says the team, whether it's a glass of wine, a dram of whisky or a bottle of beer. "It may help you fall asleep, but it dramatically reduces the quality of your rest that night," said Dr Robbins. It particularly disrupts your REM (rapid eye movement) stage of sleep, which is important for memory and learning. So yes, you will have slept and may have nodded off more easily, but some of the benefits of sleep are lost. Alcohol is also a diuretic, so you may find yourself having to deal with a full bladder in the middle of the night too. Myth 3 - Watching TV in bed helps you relax Have you ever thought "I need to wind down before bed, I'm going to watch some TV"? Well, the latest Brexit twists and turns on the BBC News at Ten might be bad for sleep. Dr Robbins argues: "Often if we're watching the television it's the nightly news… it's something that's going to cause you insomnia or stress right before bed when we're trying to power down and relax." And as for Game of Thrones, it's hard to argue the Red Wedding was relaxing. The other issue with TV - along with smartphones and tablets - is they produce blue light, which can delay the body's production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Will the light from your phone kill you? Myth 4 - If you're struggling to sleep, stay in bed You've spent so long trying to nod off you've managed to count all the sheep in New Zealand (that's about 28 million). So what should you do next? The answer is not to keep trying. "We start to associate our bed with insomnia," said Dr Robbins. "It does take the healthy sleeper about 15 minutes to fall asleep, but much longer than that… make sure to get out of bed, change the environment and do something that's mindless." Her tip - go fold some socks. Myth 5 - Hitting the snooze button Who isn't guilty of reaching for the snooze button on their phone, thinking that extra six minutes in bed is going to make all the difference? But the research team says that when the alarm goes off, we should just get up. Dr Robbins said: "Realise you will be a bit groggy - all of us are - but resist the temptation to snooze. "Your body will go back to sleep, but it will be very light, low-quality sleep." Instead the advice is to throw open the curtains and expose yourself to as much bright light as possible. Myth 6 - Snoring is always harmless Snoring can be harmless, but it can also be a sign of the disorder sleep apnoea. This causes the walls of the throat to relax and narrow during sleep, and can briefly stop people breathing. People with the condition are more likely to develop high blood pressure, an irregular heartbeat and have a heart attack or a stroke. One of the warning signs is loud snoring. NHS: Obstructive sleep apnoea Dr Robbins concludes: "Sleep is one of the most important things we can all do tonight to improve our health, our mood, our wellbeing and our longevity."

By Yvette TanBBC News Instead, much to his dismay, the struggling Asian American actor is only ever cast in parts like Generic Asian Man Number One or Background Oriental Male. He is, however, the main protagonist of the satirical novel Interior Chinatown, which last month won one of the most prestigious literary prizes in the US, the National Book Award for fiction. Its author, Charles Yu, says he wrote the book to "create a space where background characters get to have a story". Even more than that, he hopes the novel will shed more light on the ongoing debate about representation and Asian American stereotypes, and create a conversation about escaping the roles we are forced into. In the words of Willis Wu: "To be yellow in America... a special guest star, forever the guest." Not all black and white A former lawyer, Yu first shot to fame in 2010 with his novel How to Live Safely in a Science Fictional Universe. He then went on to work as a writer for the award-winning HBO television series Westworld, before returning to literature. "I struggled for years trying to get [the book] off the ground," the 44-year-old tells the BBC in a recent Zoom interview from his southern California home. But a major "catalyst" that got him going, he says, was the election of President Donald Trump in 2016. "It's sometimes really dispiriting and challenging to still feel like a foreigner [in the US]. We're from here but here is the president basically doing all the stuff he's doing to stoke xenophobia and making some very sweeping generalisations about what's foreign and what's American," says Yu. "I just felt much more of an urgency and desire to talk about immigrants and to share some of the stories of my parents. I realised I needed to write about it." And so he did. Written in the form of a screenplay, Interior Chinatown centres on the trials and travails of Willis as he tries to break into Hollywood. Set in a fictional Chinatown, the story follows Willis as he plays background characters in a police TV show called Black and White - which stars a black person and a white person. He slowly works his way up from playing bit parts like Delivery Guy and Silent Henchman to eventually clinch his dream role - Kung Fu Guy. But Willis soon realises that no matter what role he plays, he's still pandering to a stereotypical idea of what it means to be Asian-American. "The [characters] are all trapped in their roles, they're part of this narrative that has been scripted for them," says Yu. Willis' mother for example, once seen as an Asian Seductress, eventually becomes an Old Asian Woman. Willis also comes to realise more broadly, that everyone ultimately has to deal with the stereotypes they have been assigned in life. "Do you think you're the only group to be invisible?" asks one of the characters in the book. "What about older women, older people in general, black women, people that are overweight?" Yu explains: "This book is really about people not seeing other people as having their own subjectivity. When you make someone the background, whether that's an Asian character, a female love interest, an older person... you take away some of their humanity." He admits that some parts of the novel were "hard to write…[but] that's when I knew it was starting to be real". Hollywood and the road ahead The novel itself was inspired in part from his own experience as the son of Taiwanese immigrants. "I drew from my family, my parents came [from Taiwan] in the 1960s and I really wanted to capture things I've absorbed from their experience and the sacrifices they made over the years," he says. "The story of them being Americans, to me, is both inspirational and also really complicated." In one scene, Willis' father arrives in the US with hardly any money - mirroring Yu's father's experience. "I feel like a lot of people's parents have some version of this story. In my dad's case, he came to the US with like $50 or something and had to navigate this country knowing really nothing about it," he says. "And to see the span between my parents and my kids, who were born here, and to see how much has changed in just a couple of generations… [but] at the same time some aspects might not have changed. There are still parts of the population that [still] view us as foreigners." But what about in Hollywood? Is there still a sense of the Chinese man being the Kung Fu Guy? "I think the industry is slowly moving forward. I think there's a real interest in authentic and diverse points of view in terms of sexuality, gender, types of stories," he says. Crazy Rich Asians, which in 2018 made its debut to much fanfare - and also criticism - is one such example of more Asian-Americans slowly making their way to the big screen. "To me, it was very positive progress in that it opened many doors for more Asian American storytellers, actors… I think we're at that place where it's hard not to see the positives." But Yu also says a "real milestone" in terms of representation to him would be "when you can have a character who is played by an Asian in Hollywood that isn't a feature of the story or the character". "Certainly there can be valid stories where that is the point of the story, but to me, it would be really neat to see a part that could have been played by literally anybody, but they happen to cast an Asian."

He said disclosure of a secret court document on phone record collection threatened "irreversible harm". Revelations of an alleged programme to tap into servers of nine internet firms were "reprehensible", he said. Internet firms deny giving government agents access to their servers. The director of US national intelligence said he wanted to reassure Americans that the intelligence community was committed to respecting their civil liberties and privacy. He issued a strong-worded statement late on Thursday, after the UK's Guardian newspaper said a secret court order had required phone company Verizon to hand over its records to the National Security Agency (NSA) on an "ongoing daily basis". That report was followed by revelations in both the Washington Post and Guardian that US agencies tapped directly into the servers of nine internet firms to track people in a programme known as Prism. The reports about Prism will raise fresh questions about how far the US government should encroach on citizens' privacy in the interests of national security. The NSA confirmed that it had been secretly collecting millions of phone records. But Mr Clapper said the "unauthorized disclosure... threatens potentially long-lasting and irreversible harm to our ability to identify and respond to the many threats facing our nation". The article omitted "key information" about the use of the records "to prevent terrorist attacks and the numerous safeguards that protect privacy and civil liberties". He said reports about Prism contained "numerous inaccuracies". While admitting the government collected communications from internet firms, he said the policy only targets "non-US persons". 'Variety of threats' Prism was reportedly developed in 2007 out of a programme of domestic surveillance without warrants that was set up by President George W Bush after the 9/11 attacks. Prism reportedly does not collect user data, but is able to pull out material that matches a set of search terms. Mr Clapper said the communications-collection programme was "designed to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning non-US persons located outside the United States". "It cannot be used to intentionally target any US citizen, any other US person, or anyone located within the United States," he added. Mr Clapper said the programme, under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, was recently reauthorised by Congress after hearings and debate. "Information collected under this program is among the most important and valuable foreign intelligence information we collect, and is used to protect our nation from a wide variety of threats," he added. But while US citizens were not intended to be the targets of surveillance, the Washington Post says large quantities of content from Americans are nevertheless screened in order to track or learn more about the target. The data gathered through Prism has grown to become a major contributor to the president's daily briefing and accounts for almost one in seven intelligence reports, it adds. The Washington Post named the nine companies participating in the programme as Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple. Microsoft said in a statement to the BBC that it only turned over customer data when given a legally binding order, and only complied with orders for specific accounts. "If the government has a broader voluntary national security program to gather customer data we don't participate in it," Microsoft said. Meanwhile, Yahoo, Apple and Facebook said they did not give the government direct access to their servers. In a statement, Google said: "Google does not have a 'back door' for the government to access private user data." On Wednesday, it emerged that the NSA was collecting the phone records of tens of millions of Americans, after the Guardian published a secret order for the Verizon phone company to hand over its records. A senior congressman, House intelligence committee chairman Mike Rogers, told reporters that collecting Americans' phone records was legal, authorised by Congress and had not been abused by the Obama administration. He also said it had prevented a "significant" attack on the US "within the past few years", but declined to offer more information. The order requires Verizon - one of the largest phone companies in the US - to disclose to the NSA the metadata of all calls it processes, both domestic and international, in which at least one party is in the US. Such metadata includes telephone numbers, calling card numbers, the serial numbers of phones used and the time and duration of calls. It does not include the content of a call or the callers' addresses or financial information. As surveillance practices come under scrutiny in the US, a new system to monitor phone and internet connections in India is being criticised as "chilling" by New York-based group Human Rights Watch (HRW). The Central Monitoring System (CMS) enables authorities to follow all online activities, phone calls text messages and social media conversations. The Indian government said in December 2012 the system would "lawfully intercept internet and telephone services". But HRW says the system by-passes service providers in a country that has no privacy law to protect people from arbitrary intrusions. In the UK on Wednesday, a committee of MPs criticised a decision to allow Chinese firms such as Huawei to become embedded in British network infrastructure without the knowledge and scrutiny of ministers. Huawei - which denies close ties with the Chinese state - signed a 2005 telecoms deal with BT to supply equipment for a £10bn major network upgrade.
In total, 170,000 people are expected to be deployed to guarantee security across the 12 host cities. On Wednesday, President Dilma Rousseff said the armed forces could also be brought in if needed. Since last June, protesters have staged a number of street marches, with some violent episodes, raising concerns about security at the tournament. Earlier this month, a cameraman died after being hit by fireworks apparently launched by protesters. In January, the organisers had suggested the tournament's security personnel would total 100,000 people. 'Potential violence' But at a security workshop on Thursday, the organising committee said this figure should be increased. "We have a lot of concerns, not so much about protests which are a democratic right, but rather about potential violence. We are committed to preventing violence during any protest activity," a Justice ministry official, Andrei Rodrigues, told reporters. Around 150,000 personnel will be from the armed services and police. But an extra 20,000 security stewards will be trained to work inside the 12 stadiums of the tournament, organisers say. Also on Thursday, Brazil launched its first naval preparatory exercise ahead of the World Cup. Around 30,000 men, in more than 60 ships and 15 planes took part in the operations. World football governing body Fifa's security director, Ralf Mutschke, said he was confident Brazil was going to host a safe tournament. "The teams have great faith in the level of security going to be provided," Mr Mutschke said at the close of a security workshop for officials of the 32 teams which will be competing in Brazil. Brazil saw a big wave of protests in June, as the country hosted football's Confederations Cup. What started as a protest against an increase in bus and underground fares grew into a much larger movement. More than a million people took to the streets against corruption and excessive spending in preparations for the World Cup and the 2016 Olympics, which Rio will host.
However, speaking to BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme, Mr Farage claimed cabinet ministers had been banned from talking to him. But senior Tory MP Crispin Blunt said he was being a "political gadfly" and had not taken advice from diplomats. Number 10 has rejected Mr Farage's offer, saying "there is no vacancy". The UKIP MEP was the first British politician to meet Mr Trump after his US presidential election victory in November. He has since held two further meetings with the president-elect, who has said Mr Farage would make a good UK ambassador. "Political revolution" Mr Farage told the programme he did not expect to get a role in the new US administration because of his British passport. But he said the unwillingness of the UK government to use him as an intermediary with Mr Trump showed how "petty, small-minded and tribal" British politics was. Mr Blunt, chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sunday Breakfast programme that if Mr Farage was serious, he would get in touch with British diplomats to be briefed instead of "striking a pose" for television. "I know for a fact he's not sought advice from the British Embassy in the United States and put his connections at the disposal of the British government," he said. "All he's done is communicated this through the media." International Trade Secretary Liam Fox also denied Mr Farage's claim that the cabinet had been banned from talking to him. "I've not had any such instruction," he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.. Death threats Mr Farage told the BBC Britain's "political revolution" was incomplete - and there would ultimately be a similar upheaval to Mr Trump's takeover of the Republican Party. He said he was "hacked off" by the term "populist" being to describe anyone opposed to what he called the "global elite", saying it was a deliberately pejorative term. Asked about the rise in hate crime since the referendum, the former UKIP leader said he had endured four years of "endless" death threats - and that it was not just one side of the referendum argument who had behaved badly. He said he had received 10 death threats in the past two weeks alone. Paul Nuttall was elected leader of the UK Independence Party in November, replacing Mr Farage who was acting interim leader after Diane James quit just 18 days into the role.

By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The five-month-old boy has the usual DNA from his mum and dad, plus a tiny bit of genetic code from a donor. US doctors took the unprecedented step to ensure the baby boy would be free of a genetic condition that his Jordanian mother carries in her genes. Experts say the move heralds a new era in medicine and could help other families with rare genetic conditions. But they warn that rigorous checks of this new and controversial technology, called mitochondrial donation, are needed. It's not the first time scientists have created babies that have DNA from three people - that breakthrough began in the late 1990s - but it is an entirely new and significant method. Three person babies Mitochondria are tiny structures inside nearly every cell of the body that convert food into usable energy. Some women carry genetic defects in mitochondria and they can pass these on to their children. In the case of the Jordanian family, it was a disorder called Leigh Syndrome that would have proved fatal to any baby conceived. The family had already experienced the heartache of four miscarriages as well as the death of two children - one at eight months and the other at six years of age. Leigh syndrome Scientists have devised a number of fertility methods to help such families. The US team, who travelled to Mexico to carry out the procedure because there are no laws there that prohibit it, used a method that takes all the vital DNA from the mother's egg plus healthy mitochondria from a donor egg to create a healthy new egg that can be fertilised with the father's sperm. The result is a baby with 0.1% of their DNA from the donor (mitochondrial DNA) and all the genetic code for things like hair and eye colour from the mother and father. Dr John Zhang, medical director at the New Hope Fertility Centre in New York City, and his colleagues used the method to make five embryos - only one of them developed normally. The UK has already passed laws to allow the creation of babies from three people. But the science does raise ethical questions, including how any child from the technique might feel about having DNA from three people. Fertility experts say it is important to push ahead, but cautiously. Some have questioned whether we are only now hearing the success story while failed attempts could have gone unreported. Prof Alison Murdoch, part of the team at Newcastle University that has been at the forefront of three person IVF work in the UK, said: "The translation of mitochondrial donation to a clinical procedure is not a race but a goal to be achieved with caution to ensure both safety and reproducibility." Critics say the work is irresponsible. Dr David King from the pro-choice group Human Genetics Alert, said: "It is outrageous that they simply ignored the cautious approach of US regulators and went to Mexico, because they think they know better. Since when is a simplistic "to save lives is the ethical thing to do" a balanced medical ethics approach, especially when no lives were being saved?" Dr Zhang and his team say they will answer these questions when they presents their findings at a meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in October. Prof Darren Griffin, an expert in Genetics at the University of Kent, said: "This study heralds a new era in preimplantation genetics and represents a novel means for the treatment of families at risk of transmitting genetic disease. "With radical new treatments like this there are always challenging ethical issues, however any concerns need to be balanced against the ramifications of not implementing such a technology when families are in need of it."

The two-day summit, attended by the US, Chinese and Russian leaders among others, will focus on promoting growth. In a speech, US President Barack Obama sought to reassure Asia-Pacific allies of the US' commitment to the region. Vladimir Putin is expected to face a hostile reception from some Western leaders concerned about Russia's increasing military assertiveness. Speaking ahead of the G20 summit, the Russian president said US and EU sanctions imposed over Russia's actions in Ukraine would harm not just Russia but the global economy. Meanwhile, President Obama said the US believed that security in the Asia-Pacific region must depend on international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes. "We believe... that any effective security order for Asia must be based not on spheres of influence, or coercion or intimidation where big nations bully the small, but on alliances for mutual security, international law and norms that are upheld, and the peaceful resolution of disputes," he said. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott previously said world leaders would use the summit to discuss job creation, identifying tax cheats and strengthening the global economy. Leaders are expected to expand on plans agreed in February at the G20 finance ministers' meeting to boost global economic growth by 2% in five years. However the crisis in Ukraine and the threat of Ebola are also expected to be discussed at the summit, while campaigners want climate change on the agenda. "Obviously I would like this discussion to focus on the politics of economic reform," Mr Abbott said as he opened the session on Saturday. "In the end, though, this is your retreat, it is open to any of you to raise any subject that you wish." The BBC's Linda Yueh in Brisbane says that while the global economy is the official focus of the summit, the agenda is likely to reflect what the people around the table are concerned about - including Ukraine, the spread of Ebola and climate change. Our correspondent says the question will be how much can be achieved by leaders of the G20 nations with so much to discuss in just two days. In early developments: Brisbane, in the state of Queensland, is said to be taking unprecedented security measures for the summit, with some 6,000 police deployed. Twenty-seven different groups have been given permits to protest at designated areas near the Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre, the venue hosting the meeting, and thousands of people are expected over the weekend. More than 200 protesters buried their heads in the sands of Bondi Beach on Thursday in a demonstration over climate change inaction. Earlier in the week, the US and China made what US President Barack Obama described as "historic" pledges on emissions, with the US promising greater cuts and China for the first time setting a date by which emissions would peak. Australia has, however, stood firm on keeping climate change off the agenda of the G20 summit. The government is facing criticism over its climate policies. Since coming to power, Mr Abbott has axed a carbon tax and overseen a 70% fall in investment in renewable energy. Eyes will also be on President Putin, amid tensions over Russia's role in Ukraine. Some Australians had called for Mr Putin to be blocked from the summit over the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. Thirty-eight Australians were among the 298 people who died when the plane was brought down over rebel-held eastern Ukraine, by a missile that the West believes was supplied by Russia. Russia rejects the claim. Mr Abbott, who discussed the issue with Mr Putin in Beijing earlier this week, described Russia's actions in Ukraine as part of a "regrettable pattern" by a nation that was being "much more assertive". He said he told Mr Putin that Russia should aspire to be a superpower "for peace and freedom and prosperity" instead of "trying to recreate the lost glories of tsarism or the old Soviet Union".

By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent These tests, held every three years by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, measure pupils' skills in reading, numeracy and science. Pisa tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment - have become the leading international benchmark. The findings indicate that China has an education system that is overtaking many Western countries. While there has been intense interest in China's economic and political development, this provides the most significant insight into how it is teaching the next generation. 'Incredible resilience' The Pisa 2009 tests showed that Shanghai was top of the international education rankings. But it was unclear whether Shanghai and another chart-topper, Hong Kong, were unrepresentative regional showcases. Mr Schleicher says the unpublished results reveal that pupils in other parts of China are also performing strongly. "Even in rural areas and in disadvantaged environments, you see a remarkable performance." In particular, he said the test results showed the "resilience" of pupils to succeed despite tough backgrounds - and the "high levels of equity" between rich and poor pupils. "Shanghai is an exceptional case - and the results there are close to what I expected. But what surprised me more were the results from poor provinces that came out really well. The levels of resilience are just incredible. "In China, the idea is so deeply rooted that education is the key to mobility and success." Investing in the future The results for disadvantaged pupils would be the envy of any Western country, he says. Mr Schleicher is confident of the robustness of this outline view of China's education standards. In an attempt to get a representative picture, tests were taken in nine provinces, including poor, middle-income and wealthier regions. The Chinese government has so far not allowed the OECD to publish the actual data. But Mr Schleicher says the results reveal a picture of a society investing individually and collectively in education. On a recent trip to a poor province in China, he says he saw that schools were often the most impressive buildings. He says in the West, it is more likely to be a shopping centre. "You get an image of a society that is investing in its future, rather than in current consumption." There were also major cultural differences when teenagers were asked about why people succeeded at school. "North Americans tell you typically it's all luck. 'I'm born talented in mathematics, or I'm born less talented so I'll study something else.' "In Europe, it's all about social heritage: 'My father was a plumber so I'm going to be a plumber'. "In China, more than nine out of 10 children tell you: 'It depends on the effort I invest and I can succeed if I study hard.' "They take on responsibility. They can overcome obstacles and say 'I'm the owner of my own success', rather than blaming it on the system." Education's World Cup This year will see another round of Pisa tests - it's like World Cup year for international education. And Mr Schleicher's tips for the next fast-improving countries are Brazil, Turkey and Poland. Mr Schleicher, a German based in the OECD's Paris headquarters, has become the godfather of such global education comparisons. Armed with a spreadsheet and an impeccably polite manner, his opinions receive close attention in the world's education departments. The White House responded to the last Pisa results with President Barack Obama's observation that the nation which "out-educates us today will out-compete us tomorrow". The next round of global league tables will test 500,000 pupils in more than 70 countries - with the results to be published late next year. Education ministers will be looking nervously at the outcome. "In the past, politicians could always say we're doing better than last year - everyone could be a success," he says, describing the tendency for national results to rise each year. The arrival of Pisa tests sent an icy draught through these insulated corridors. No excuses Perhaps the biggest discomfort of all was for Germany - where "Pisa shock" described the discovery that their much vaunted education system was distinctly average. And the biggest change in attitude, he says, has been the United States - once with no interest in looking abroad, now enthusiastically borrowing ideas from other countries. "Education is a field dominated by beliefs and traditions, it's inward looking. As a system you can find all kinds of excuses and explanations for not succeeding. "The idea of Pisa was to take away all the excuses. "People say you can only improve an education system over 25 years - but look at Poland and Singapore, which have improved in a very short time, we've seen dramatic changes." The biggest lesson of the Pisa tests, he says, is showing there is nothing inevitable about how schools perform. "Poverty is no longer destiny. You can see this at the level of economies, such as South Korea, Singapore." Fair comparison? A criticism of such rankings has been that it is unfair. How can an impoverished developing country be compared with the stockpiled multiple advantages of a wealthy Scandinavian nation? Here Mr Schleicher makes a significant distinction. It might not be fair, but such comparisons are extremely relevant. "Relevance and fairness are not the same thing," he says. Youngsters in the poorest countries are still competing in a global economy. "It's a terrible thing to take away the global perspective." He also attacks the idea of accepting lower expectations for poorer children - saying this was the "big trap in the 1970s". "It was giving the disadvantaged child an excuse - you come from a poor background, so we'll lower the horizon for you, we'll make it easier. "But that child has still got to compete in a national labour market. "This concept of 'fairness' is deeply unfair - because by making life easier for children from difficult circumstances, we lower their life chances." 'Sorting mechanism' So why are the rising stars in Asia proving so successful? Mr Schleicher says it's a philosophical difference - expecting all pupils to make the grade, rather than a "sorting mechanism" to find a chosen few. He says anyone can create an education system where a few at the top succeed, the real challenge is to push through the entire cohort. In China, he says this means using the best teachers in the toughest schools. The shifting in the balance of power will be measured again with Pisa 2012, with pupils sitting tests from Stockholm to Seoul, London to Los Angeles, Ankara to Adelaide. "I don't think of Pisa as being about ranking, it tells you what's possible. How well could we be doing?"
The police headquarters and the main government building fell to the Taliban on Wednesday, a local senator said. The Taliban say their fighters have seized the entire district. However, the Afghan defence ministry said fighting was continuing and that reinforcements had been sent. Sangin saw almost a quarter of British military fatalities during the UK's combat mission in Afghanistan. District governor Haji Suliman Shah told the BBC he had been airlifted from the district HQ to Shorabak base - formerly Camp Bastion - in the provincial capital Lashkar Gah early on Wednesday, along with 15 wounded security force members. A few hundred police and soldiers have taken refuge at an army barracks about 7km (four miles) from Sangin, and are besieged there. Why Sangin matters Read more about Sangin Harsh lessons from Sangin Who are the Taliban? Ashuqullah, a police officer at the barracks, told the BBC the "entire" town was controlled by militants. "We have not seen any help," he said. "Support troops have been airdropped at a distance... but all roads are blocked and in the militants' control," he added. There were many wounded at the barracks needing urgent evacuation, he said. Speaking in Kabul, Afghanistan's acting Defence Minister Masoum Stanikzai described the situation in Helmand as "manageable" and said fresh support troops had been sent in. Afghan government forces had been "thinly spread" over the whole country, he said, and had been trying their best to hold all areas. A small contingent of British troops has been sent to Helmand "in an advisory role," the British government said on Tuesday. A Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, claimed on Wednesday: "The Sangin district centres, its police HQ, and other establishments were under continued attacks of the mujahideen and today... with God's grace the district was fully captured by the mujahideen. "The white flag of the Islamic emirate is at full mast at the district now.'' Haji Daud, the head of the Sangin district people's council, told the BBC that Sangin residents had fled the district to neighbouring areas. Responding to the defence minister's claims, he said: "Those whose family - brothers and siblings and parents - are not fighting on the front, they always say the situation is not dangerous in the area..." "Those who make such comments do not care to defend Helmand." Pharmacy owner Sarwah Shah, who fled to Lashkar Gah, told the BBC that all of the families living on his street in Sangin - around 20 to 30 houses - had fled. Another resident Agha Wali said he had fled Sangin with his children two days ago. He had had to leave all his possessions behind, he said. The Taliban have already seized control of all but two districts in Helmand. On Monday the deputy governor of Helmand complained of a lack of government support in an open letter on Facebook to President Ashraf Ghani. "Helmand will collapse to the enemies and it's not like Kunduz, where we could launch an operation from the airport to retake it. That is just impossible and a dream," he wrote. In September, the Taliban briefly overran the northern Afghan city of Kunduz in one of their biggest victories since 2001.
In a statement, the Taliban acknowledged Mansour's death for the first time and named his successor as Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada. Analysts say it is unlikely the group will change direction under hardline religious scholar Akhundzada. Meanwhile, a breakaway faction has rejected the move, saying Akhundzada does not represent the group. This highlights deep divisions in the Taliban following the death of the group's founder Mullah Mohammad Omar and his replacement by Mansour. Mansour was killed in a strike on his car in Pakistan's Balochistan province on Saturday. Under his stewardship, the Taliban refused to take part in peace talks. Instead, militant attacks escalated and became more daring. Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada, a former head of the Taliban courts, was a deputy leader to Mansour. Profile: New Taliban chief Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada Appointment signals continuity The trail of clues after Taliban leader's death Analysis: Waheed Massoud, editor, BBC Afghan service, Kabul It doesn't look as if there will be a major shift in the Taliban's approach to peace talks under the new leadership. Mawlawi Hibatullah Akhundzada was deputy to Mullah Mansour and held senior positions under the movement's founder Mullah Omar. He comes from Kandahar in the Taliban heartlands of southern Afghanistan and seems to have been an acceptable choice for a significant number of Taliban shura (council) members. The new leader is not as controversial as his predecessor, who led the militants for two years before news emerged that Mullah Omar was actually dead. A Taliban statement said the new appointment had been unanimous, the same word the Taliban used when Mullah Mansour took over. Splits soon emerged after that - this time there could still be some disagreements, but probably not enough to challenge the new leader's authority. "Hibatullah Akhundzada has been appointed as the new leader of the Islamic Emirate (Taliban) after a unanimous agreement in the shura (supreme council), and all the members of shura pledged allegiance to him," the Taliban said in a statement. It also said that Mullah Mohammad Yaqoob, son of Mullah Omar, would become a joint deputy head of the movement, alongside current deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani. Sirajuddin Haqqani, who is much more well known, is leader of the Haqqani network which has been blamed for some of the most violent attacks inside Afghanistan. The group is known for its daring raids on Western and Afghan targets, particularly in Kabul. Mansour named Akhundzada as his successor in his will, Taliban sources told AFP, in what may be an attempt to legitimise the transition. A spokesman for Afghanistan's chief executive, Abdullah Abdullah, urged the new Taliban leader to join talks. "We invite Mula Hibatullah to peace. Political settlement is the only option for the Taliban or new leadership will face the fate of Mansour," Javid Faisal tweeted. In 2015 the Taliban was deeply divided over the selection of Mullah Mansour as the new leader. The fact that Akhundzada comes from the traditional Taliban stronghold of Kandahar is likely to please rank-and-file fighters, the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Kabul says. But there is already controversy surrounding his appointment, with a splinter faction led by Mullah Mohammad Rasool saying it will reject the group's new leadership. "I believe this appointment is done by outsiders. This does not represent the Taliban movement," the faction's deputy head and spokesman, Mullah Abdul Manan Niazi, told the BBC. "We call them a group for the benefit of foreigners. They cannot represent Afghans and the Taliban. And we are standing against them." Separately on Wednesday, 11 people were killed and many others were injured in a suicide attack that hit a bus carrying court employees in Kabul. The Taliban said it was behind the attack.

The framed Girl With Balloon, one of the artist's best known works, was auctioned by Sotheby's in London. Moments after the piece was sold, the canvas of a girl reaching for a heart-shaped balloon shredded itself. Quoting Picasso on his Instagram, Banksy wrote: "The urge to destroy is also a creative urge - Picasso." The clip starts with a caption, saying: "A few years ago, I secretly built a shredder into a painting." The video then shows someone in a hoodie installing the device, before another caption, saying: "In case it was ever put up for auction." The video then shows the moment the painting shredded itself at the auction house on Friday, captured on a mobile phone. It is unclear how the shredder was activated. 'We just got Banksy-ed' Moments before, the 2006 stencilled spray-painting had sold for £1.042m. "It appears we just got Banksy-ed," said Alex Branczik, Sotheby's senior director and head of contemporary art in Europe. Earlier, Banksy posted a picture of the moment it happened on his Instagram, with the words: "Going, going, gone..." John Brandler, director of Brandler Art Galleries, described Banksy as "the ultimate publicity artist" and said the stunt was "absolutely brilliant". "He has made Damien Hirst look like an amateur," Mr Brandler said. Banksy rose to prominence through a series of graffiti pieces across the country. The enigmatic artist is thought to have grown up in Bristol, but his identity has remained a secret despite much speculation over the years. Among his recent works was the 2015 opening of Dismaland, a Disneyland-esque attraction at a lido in Weston-super-Mare, which he described as a "family theme park unsuitable for children". In 2017, Girl With Balloon, which originally appeared on a wall in Great Eastern Street, London, was voted the nation's favourite artwork. The gallery version featured spray paint and acrylic on canvas, mounted on a board. Does the buyer still have to pay? Sotheby's has not revealed who bought the piece before it was shredded. At the moment it is unclear whether their contract still stands. Mr Branczik told the Financial Times the auction house was trying to "figure out" what the stunt means. He said: "We have not experienced this situation in the past ...where a painting spontaneously shredded, upon achieving a [near-]record for the artist. "We are busily figuring out what this means in an auction context." In a statement on its website, Sotheby's described the incident as "unexpected" and said it had become "instant art world history". Will it be worth more now, or is it ruined? Opinion is split. Some social media posters have speculated that the prank could have actually caused the artwork to increase in value. However, others have questioned whether the buyer would still have to pay for it - or would even want to. Mr Brandler said the more publicity works of art get, the pricier they tend to become. "It was the best publicity stunt he [Banksy] could think of," he said. You may also like:
It would avoid emails and other data automatically passing through the United States. In her weekly podcast, she said she would raise the issue on Wednesday with French President Francois Hollande. Revelations of mass surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA) have prompted huge concern in Europe. Disclosures by the US whistleblower Edward Snowden suggested even the mobile phones of US allies, such as Mrs Merkel, had been monitored by American spies. Classified NSA documents revealed that large amounts of personal data are collected from the internet by US and British surveillance. Mrs Merkel criticised the fact that Facebook and Google can be based in countries with low levels of data protection while carrying out business in nations that offer more rigorous safeguards. "Above all, we'll talk about European providers that offer security for our citizens, so that one shouldn't have to send emails and other information across the Atlantic," she said. "Rather, one could build up a communication network inside Europe." Sensitive There was no doubt that Europe had to do more in the realm of data protection, she said. A French official was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying that the government in Paris planned to take up the German initiative. Personal privacy is a sensitive issue in Germany where extensive surveillance was carried out under the Nazis and in communist East Germany. A foreign policy spokesman for Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats, Philipp Missfelder, recently said revelations about US spying had helped bring relations with Washington down to their worst level since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. Germany has been trying to persuade Washington to agree to a "no-spy" agreement but without success.
British-born Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, imprisoned since 2002, has had his sentence reduced to seven years for kidnapping, said lawyer Khawaja Naveed. Three other men given life sentences over the killing have been acquitted by the Sindh High Court and released. The Sindh chief prosecutor says he will lodge an appeal in the Sheikh case. The province's prosecutor general Fiaz Shah told the BBC he expected Sheikh to remain in jail pending the appeal, which would be heard by the Supreme Court. A group of US journalists, including former colleagues of Pearl, said in 2011 that they believed Sheikh had not carried out the beheading. The Pearl Project alleged the killer was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who is being held in Guantanamo Bay, accused of being behind the 9/11 attacks. Mr Naveed said he expected his client to be released "in a few days". What happened to Daniel Pearl? Pearl, who worked for the Wall Street Journal, went missing in January 2002. He had been researching links between Islamist militant activity in Karachi and Richard Reid, who tried to blow up a passenger plane using bombs hidden in his shoes. According to prosecutors, Omar Saeed Sheikh lured him to a meeting with an Islamic cleric. The two had built a relationship discussing concerns about their wives, who were both pregnant at the time. Almost a month later, a video showing the 38-year-old's beheading was sent to the US consulate in Karachi. Pearl's son, Adam, was born in May 2002. Sheikh was convicted of Pearl's murder in July 2002 by an anti-terrorism court, and has been on death row since. Who is Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh? Sheikh was born in London in 1973, where he attended public school before going on to study at the London School of Economics. He did not graduate, failing to return after driving aid to Bosnia after his first year. He was arrested for being involved in the kidnapping of four tourists - three British and one American - in Delhi in 1994. He was released from prison as part of demands by militants who hijacked a plane in 1999. According to news agency Reuters, police in India later accused him of transferring money to one of the militants who flew a plane into the World Trade Center on 9/11. Longstanding questions over Sheikh's conviction By M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad The main argument of the defence lawyers was that the prosecution had failed to prove their case beyond doubt. They may have a point. There have been questions over whether the four had any direct role in Daniel Pearl's murder, though there was some evidence to show Sheikh's involvement in his kidnapping. Sheikh was widely seen as having links to Pakistan's top intelligence service, the ISI, as well as al-Qaeda, and had a role in forming the Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group that carried out attacks in Indian Kashmir during the 1990s. His arrest and conviction in 2002 came in quick succession, at a time when Pakistan was under severe pressure from the United States to eliminate terror networks operating on its soil. But the Pakistani judiciary has sat on his appeal for nearly two decades, and some observers believe the present ruling has come at a time when the mood in the US and the rest of the world has changed and nobody seems to be worried about the terrorists of the past.
By Tom Gerken, BBC UGC & Social NewsAnd Katherine Zeveleva, BBC Monitoring Communist Party MP Tamara Pletnyova told a Moscow Radio station that she was "not a nationalist" but believed Russian women should avoid sex with people "of a different race" because "their children suffer". She was responding to a question about the "kids of the Olympics" - referencing the claim that there was a spike in births of mixed-race children in Russia after the 1980 Summer Olympics. Ms Pletnyova said that these children were "abandoned" by their foreign fathers. "It's not so bad if the fathers are of the same race," she said. "But if they are of a different race, then that's it. "[The children] are abandoned, and they stay here with their mother. We should be giving birth to our children." You may also like: 'Say No to Racism'? Ms Pletnyova has been widely condemned online, with some people drawing parallels between her comments and Fifa's Say No to Racism campaign. Recalling how a former ice skater defended a racist tweet by claiming her Twitter account had been hacked, radio presenter Tayana Felgengauer wondered if Ms Pletnyova might claim something similar had happened to her. "I wonder what Pletnyova will say when they remind her of Say No to Racism," she tweeted. Further critics of Ms Pletnyova have included one who called for her to be "thrown out of the Duma" (Russian parliament). One Twitter user wondered if the Russian MP intended to "monitor the behaviour of female Russians of reproductive age", while another pointed out the irony in the fact Ms Pletnyova had previously been "the head of the Committee for Nationalities". But not all the comments have been negative. Some people have agreed with Ms Pletnyova that "we should bear our own Russian children". And one asked: "What is wrong with what she said?" While others have come forward to defend her right to free speech, with one person saying: "I believe that everyone can freely express their views, including MP Pletnyova."
The Home Affairs Select Committee said much low-level internet-based financial crime was falling into a "black hole" and was not reported to the police. The MPs said more officers should be trained in digital crime detection and e-crime experts protected from cuts. The Home Office said the authorities must "keep pace" with criminals. Publishing its first report on the subject, the cross-party committee said e-crime took various forms, did not recognise national borders and could be committed "at almost any time or in any place". 'Off the hook' It called for a dedicated cyber-espionage team to respond to attacks, many of which are believed to be backed by foreign governments because they are so sophisticated. Offences range from attacks on computer networks and the use of viruses to steal data to the use of cyberspace to facilitate traditional crimes such as forgery, sabotage, drug smuggling and people trafficking. The committee said it was worried by the evidence it had heard during its inquiry about the UK's e-crime fighting capability. It said it had been told by Adrian Leppard, deputy assistant commissioner at the City of London Police, that up to a quarter of the UK's 800 specialist internet crime officers could be lost due to budget cuts. This was despite evidence the UK was a prime target for many of the 1,300 criminal gangs specialising in fraud. A quarter of the gangs, many of which are based in eastern Europe and Russia, use the internet as their principal means of deception. The MPs said police cutbacks came on top of proposed 10% cuts to the budget of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre. "At a time when fraud and e-crime is going up, the capability of the country to address it is going down," the report concluded. "Ministers have acknowledged the increasing threat of e-crime but it is clear that sufficient funding and resources have not been allocated to the law enforcement responsible for tackling it." As well as calling for a cyber-espionage team, the report's recommendations include: Keith Vaz, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said the UK's response to e-crime was too "fractured". He told BBC 5 live: "Our country is the number one target for gangs in 25 countries." He added: "It's much easier and more lucrative to steal on the internet than it is to go out and rob a bank. "These are real e-wars. At the moment we are not winning the e-wars." Mr Vaz said the gangs committing e-crimes were "predominantly" from eastern Europe, including European Union countries such as Romania. The UK's eavesdropping centre GCHQ suggested earlier this year that 80% of cyber-attacks could be prevented by better management of information online. The Police Federation of England and Wales said the MPs' report was further evidence that recent figures showing a 10% fall in recorded crime last year were "misleading". Javed Khan, chief executive of the charity Victim Support, called the findings "worrying", adding: "E-criminals cannot be allowed to get ahead of our police and their partners." And Matthew Fell, of the CBI business group, questioned the need to "force businesses to report a cyber attack as soon as it happens", adding that the they "should instead be focusing on fighting the attack privately". He said reporting could even prove "counterproductive" and put firms "at greater risk". The government announced increased funding for cyber-security in 2010, while a single National Cybercrime Unit will be formed later this year as part of the new National Crime Agency. Deputy Chief Constable Peter Goodman, who speaks for the Association of Chief Police officers on e-crime, said the new unit would bring a "real step change in our response to e-crime". A Home Office spokesman said: "Crime is at record low levels and this government is taking action to tackle the cyber-threat, investing more than £850m through the national cyber-security programme to develop and maintain cutting-edge capabilities." He said the new cybercrime unit would "target the most serious offenders and provide enhanced intelligence for Ceop so they can protect even more children from harm". "But we know we need to keep pace with criminals as they target the web and so we continue to consider ways to ensure the police and security services have access to communications data," the spokesman added.
The Red Arrows aerobatic display team passed over Edinburgh as part of a UK-wide flyover. Cities and towns across Scotland and the rest of the UK also took part in a three-minute bell-ringing event to celebrate the occasion. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond sent a good luck message to the "Scolympians" competing in the games. Four Olympic football matches have already been played at Scotland's national stadium, Hampden Park. Medal hopes for Scottish athletes, who compete as part of Team GB, include track cyclist Sir Chris Hoy, tennis star Andy Murray and Hannah Miley, the swimmer. The Red Arrows flew over Edinburgh's Holyrood Park at 12:33, on a route also taking in the Scottish Parliament, the Royal Mile, the castle and Festival Square. At 08:12 people across Scotland took part in the bell-ringing event , inspired by Turner Prize-winning artist Martin Creed. They had been asked to ring whatever bells they like as quickly and as loudly as possible. The precise time was chosen because it was 12 hours before the time 20:12 is displayed on a 24-hour clock, while the ringing of bells has often been used to mark special moments in time, such as the end of World War II. Bell-ringing locations included the Scottish Parliament, Queen's Park Baptist Church in Glasgow, Aberdeen Art Gallery and Dundee Contemporary Arts. Fiona Bradley, from the Fruit Market Gallery in Edinburgh, was among those taking part in the event. She told BBC Scotland: "It is about joining in. It is about showing that art isn't something to be scared of, that art is something that makes itself in front of you, with you, while you look at it and join in. "It seems to me pretty much absolutely about what art is about." 'Elite band' At Skaw Beach on Unst in Shetland, the most northerly inhabited island of the UK, a single bell was due to ring out but instead a small crowd of about 30 people turned up with bells and chimes. In the Scottish Borders, local farmer Andrew Rodger took time out from his morning livestock checking rounds to ring the bell at the country kirk in Longformacus in the Lammermuir hills. In Mr Salmond's message to Scotland's 54 Olympic and 23 Paralympic athletes - who he described as the "Scolympians" - the first minister urged them to go for gold. He said: "You join an elite band of Scottish sporting heroes, from Eric Liddell's movie-inspiring win in Paris in 1924, to Sir Chris Hoy's record breaking four gold medals, we are proud of the Scottish talent hailing from our shores." Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont also wished Team GB well. She added: "Whilst we will be keeping an especially keen eye on our Scottish competitors, the enthusiasm that thousands of Scots showed as the Olympic torch travelled across Scotland again showed the universal appeal of sport and the Games." Edinburgh's Festival Square hosted Games opening event celebrations from 18:00, featuring live music and the showing of the ceremony itself on a big screen. In Dumfries, the ceremony was to be shown on a special screen set up at the Midsteeple in the town centre. As well as live coverage from London, there will be music from a number of local bands.
Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter A blog post written by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler detailed a litany of instances during her time at the firm. "What she describes is abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in,” Uber boss Travis Kalanick said in a statement. “Anyone who behaves this way or thinks this is OK will be fired.” The controversy is just the latest to surround the company, particularly on issues around the treatment of women at the firm. Ms Fowler wrote that shortly after joining the San Francisco-based company, her new manager made sexual advances towards her. She wrote: "He was trying to stay out of trouble at work, he said, but he couldn't help getting in trouble, because he was looking for women to have sex with.” Lack of diversity After reporting the incident to Human Resources, Ms Fowler said she was told no further action would be taken as it was a “first offense”. She said she was told she should try and join an alternative team at the company. From here, she goes on to list several instances where she felt poorly treated. She cites data - which the BBC has been unable to verify - that the number of female engineers at the company has plummeted over the past year. Unlike Google, Apple, Facebook and others, Uber chooses not to disclose figures about diversity at the company. On Sunday evening, Mr Kalanick responded to the allegations. "I have just read Susan Fowler's blog. "It's the first time this has come to my attention so I have instructed Liane Hornsey, our new Chief Human Resources Officer, to conduct an urgent investigation into these allegations. "We seek to make Uber a just workplace and there can be absolutely no place for this kind of behaviour at Uber.” The BBC has attempted to contact several high-profile Uber investors for comment. Posting on Twitter, Jason Calacanis - an early investor in the firm - wrote: "What she [Ms Fowler] describes is obviously not acceptable. Trust management will take swift action." 'Leather jacket reward' The row is bringing concerns over sexism in Silicon Valley once again to the fore - with Ms Fowler's blog post provoking a sense of deja vu for many in the industry. While Ms Fowler's post was about Uber, several noted on Sunday that her experiences were instantly recognisable to other women working for firms in Silicon Valley and the wider technology industry. That said, some of the anecdotes detailed in Ms Fowler's 3,000-word post range from the shocking to the farcical. After making the initial complaint about her manager, she said she was threatened with getting negative performance review scores - making it harder to gain promotions or transfers within the company. She said she was chastised for keeping email evidence of her complaints. One of the more bizarre instances involved leather jackets. Ms Fowler described how the team she was on had been promised leather jackets as a thank you for their work, and the team was measured up for the right sizes. Ms Fowler wrote: "One day, all of the women (there were, I believe, six of us left in the org) received an email saying that no leather jackets were being ordered for the women because there were not enough women in the organisation to justify placing an order. "I replied and said that I was sure Uber could find room in their budget to buy leather jackets for the, what, six women if it could afford to buy them for over a hundred and twenty men. "The director replied back, saying that if we women really wanted equality, then we should realise we were getting equality by not getting the leather jackets." 'Preparing to quit' Since being founded in 2009, Uber has gained a reputation as a company that espouses Silicon Valley's so-called "bro" culture of male-dominated, macho work environments. That view was exacerbated three years ago when Mr Kalanick quipped, in an interview with GQ Magazine, that an on-demand service for women might be called "Boober". In 2014, Buzzfeed reported that Uber executive Emil Michael had suggested the firm would spend money on digging up dirt on Sarah Lacy, a technology journalist who accused the firm of being misogynistic. This latest, most detailed critique of the company's working culture is perhaps the most damaging yet. "When I joined Uber, the organisation I was part of was over 25% women," Ms Fowler wrote. "By the time I was trying to transfer to another [engineering] organisation, this number had dropped down to less than 6%. "Women were transferring out of the organisation, and those who couldn't transfer were quitting or preparing to quit." She now works at payments company Stripe, also based in San Francisco.

The gunman, 26, opened fire at Umpqua Community College on Thursday morning and was killed in a police shootout. There were conflicting reports on casualties but Douglas County Sheriff John Hanlin said 10 dead, including the gunman, was "the best" figure. Police have not identified the attacker but unnamed officers have told US media his name is Chris Harper Mercer. Mr Hanlin said he would not confirm the name, adding: "I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act." Warning The gunman was reportedly born in the UK and moved to the US as a young boy. A man identified as the gunman's father, Ian Mercer, told US media he was "just as shocked as everybody" by his son's actions. The killer's motive is not known, although police said they were investigating reports that he had warned of his intentions on social media. What we know about Chris Harper Mercer Hours after the attack, in which seven were also injured, a visibly frustrated President Barack Obama demanded tighter gun laws, saying prayers are "no longer enough". Such shootings - and his own response - had become routine, he said, barely concealing his exasperation. "We are not the only country on Earth that has people with mental illnesses or want to do harm to other people. "But we are the only advanced country on Earth that sees these mass shootings every few months." Referring to a BBC interview in which he talked about this, he said countries like the UK and Australia showed that effective legislation was possible. Obama's 'hopeless' push for gun control Lorie Andrews, who lives opposite the campus, said she heard what sounded like fireworks and when she came out of her home she saw students streaming out. "One girl came out wrapped in a blanket with blood on her," she said. Hannah Miles, 19, said that she and fellow students were led to a nearby bookshop, where they hid in a back room. "No-one really was sure what was going on," she said. "The next thing we knew, there were three or four more gun shots and everybody just looked at each other - and we knew." Stacy Boylan, the father of a woman who survived the shooting, told CNN that his daughter had described how the gunman asked his victims to state their religion before opening fire. According to Mr Boylan, his daughter said the gunman told the Christians he killed that they were about "going to see God in just about one second". Another student who survived the shooting, Kortney Moore, gave a similar account to a local newspaper, The News-Review. The 3,000-student school is located in Roseburg, Oregon, a rural area about 175 miles (280 km) south of Portland. Hundreds of people gathered for a vigil in a Roseburg park in the evening. In audio from police radio channels an officer can be heard saying the suspect was down and that there were "multiple gunshot wounds", and calling for multiple ambulances to go the scene. The suspect supposedly used a "long gun". Students were transported by bus to a local fairground to be reunited with their loved ones. According to Umpqua Community College's website, the average age of students is about 38.
By Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese Service, Washington Eight years ago, Shizheng Tie, then aged 13, moved alone from China to rural Ohio for one sole purpose: education. She once had a budding American dream, but now she says she is facing hostility in that country. "As a Chinese living in the US, I am very scared now," she says. Tie, now a senior student at Johns Hopkins University, describes America as "anti-China" and "chaotic". Some 360,000 Chinese students are currently enrolled in schools in the US. In the past months, they have experienced two historical events - a global pandemic and unprecedented tensions between the US and China, which have reshaped their views of the two nations. 'Politicised' and 'anxious' The majority of Chinese students in the US are self-funded and hope their western education will lead to a good career. Meanwhile, Washington has warned that not all students from China are "normal", claiming some are Beijing's proxies who conduct economic espionage, orchestrate pro-China views and monitor other Chinese students on American campuses. The Trump administration recently cancelled visas for 3,000 students they believe have ties to the Chinese military. One US senator even suggested that Chinese nationals should be banned from studying math and science in America. Amid the harsh rhetoric, many Chinese students fear that they are being turned into a political target for Washington. Tie, majoring in environmental science, says she is pessimistic about her academic future in the US, given the growing scrutiny over Chinese students and scholars in science and technology. "I used to think I'd pursue my PhD in the US and perhaps settle down here, but now I see myself returning to China after obtaining a master's degree," Tie says. Yingyi Ma, associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University, says Chinese students in the US are now "politicised and marginalised at an unprecedented level", as Washington is sending "very unfriendly signals". The strained bilateral relations have swayed public opinion, as a recent survey found that 73% of American adults have an unfavourable view of China - an historic high. Prof Ma published a book called Ambitious and Anxious this January, focusing on Chinese students' experience in America. "If I write the book now, I will only keep 'anxious' in the title," she says. 'Unwanted' at home As the coronavirus continues to spread in the US, Tie prefers to return to China, where the outbreak appears to be largely under control. But the country has ordered sharp cuts in international flights to prevent imported cases, leaving many Chinese students overseas, stranded thousands of miles away from their families. On Chinese social media, some comments portrayed these students as spoiled brats, who had fled from the country's fiercely competitive education system and now may imperil its success in containing the virus. "America wants to kick us out, while China doesn't allow us to return," Tie says. This sentiment is commonly shared among Chinese students in the US. Iris Li, a 20-year-old junior student from China at Emory University in Atlanta, describes the students as "being kicked like a ball" between the two countries. "We are getting the short end of the stick from both sides," Li says. Racism 'boosts' support for Beijing After worrying about the outbreak in their home country from afar, these young Chinese are now witnessing the coronavirus crisis in the US. They were perplexed by the cultural differences regarding mask-wearing. They were unsettled by President Trump's use of the phrases "kung flu" and "China virus". Some have even experienced racial harassment firsthand. Racial discrimination during the pandemic has "burst their bubble," Prof Ma says. A new paper stated that anti-Chinese racism boosts support for Beijing's authoritarian rule among Chinese students in the US. Jennifer Pan, co-author of the paper and assistant professor of Communications at Stanford University, says there is a general belief that Chinese students overseas are indoctrinated to wholeheartedly support the Chinese Communist Party. "That's not the case," Prof Pan says, "What does change their political views is racism." The research found that college freshmen from China who read derogatory comments against Chinese people are more likely to support Beijing, while general criticism against the government's coronavirus handling did not produce the same effects. Prof Pan says the findings suggest that Chinese students in the US, whose survey responses are "mature, sophisticated and thoughtful for their age", can rationally process criticism against China. Rethinking China and America Despite her frustration over China's travel restrictions, Tie says she has become more patriotic since living aboard. "I had believed America to be a wonderland of dreams, equality and tolerance for all. I certainly don't believe it anymore," she wrote in her school newspaper in June, criticising America's "Sinophobia". In February, she penned an online petition, protesting against her university hosting a panel with Hong Kong democracy activists. But Tie says she's not a "little pink", a somewhat disparaging term for nationalistic Chinese youth active on the internet. "I am patriotic in a rational way, not as a result of brainwashing," Tie says, adding that she views both Washington and Beijing critically, citing the lack of freedom of speech in China. "Both countries let me down many times," Tie says, "but China is my motherland, so I am more willing to endure that frustration." Similar to Tie, Li plans to return to China after her study, with transformed understandings of her home and host countries. In early July, Washington announced a policy barring foreign students from staying in the country, but the decision was rescinded after receiving waves of criticism. "It made me feel hopeful about the US," Li says, "This would not happen in China." The sociology and religious studies student thinks the pandemic has laid bare the advantages and weaknesses of both political systems. While the Chinese government seems to act more effectively, the US allows dissent, and at times, it is able to correct its own mistakes. American education has made her "more anti-China," Li says with a laugh. She recalls feeling "very uncomfortable" when she first arrived in America six years ago and saw her fellow students waving Taiwanese flags, which are seen in mainland China as a symbol for Taiwan independence. But after getting to know the Taiwanese students, she realised that though their views may have been completely different, they could discuss issues respectfully, which is encouraged in American classrooms. "Studying in the US is an important experience in my life," one that she says she'd never regret. "But I am eager to help change China, where my work may be more meaningful."
Athletes affected include tennis players Venus and Serena Williams and teenage gymnast Simone Biles. A group calling itself "Fancy Bears" claimed responsibility for the hack of a Wada database. After the leak, Ms Biles said she had long been taking medicine for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. The hacker group had accused her of taking an "illicit psycho-stimulant", but she said she had "always followed the rules". The Rio Olympics quadruple gold medallist had obtained the necessary permission to take prescription medicine on the Wada banned drugs list, USA Gymnastics said in a statement. Wada said in a statement that the cyber attacks were an attempt to undermine the global anti-doping system. Russian government spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was "out of the question" that the Kremlin or secret services were involved in the hacking, Russian news agencies reported. The hackers accessed records detailing "Therapeutic Use Exemptions" (TUEs), which allow the use of banned substances due to athletes' verified medical needs. "By virtue of the TUE, Biles has not broken any drug-testing regulations, including at the Olympic Games in Rio," USA Gymnastics said. Fancy Bears said TUEs amount to "licences for doping". The leaked documents allege that Serena Williams was granted permission to use drugs commonly used to treat muscle injuries, such as anti-inflammatories, while Biles is said to use Ritalin - a treatment for her ADHD. Former - Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority head Richard Ings said: "Nothing I see here gives me cause for alarm," adding it looked "totally normal". "The issue here is privacy breach." 'Compromising trust' Russia's track and field team were banned from the Rio Olympics over an alleged state-backed doping programme. All of its athletes are barred from the ongoing Paralympics. "Let it be known that these criminal acts are greatly compromising the effort by the global anti-doping community to re-establish trust in Russia," Wada director-general Olivier Niggli said. 'An act of revenge?' - Analysis by BBC sports editor Dan Roan This is the latest twist in what was already the biggest doping scandal in the history of sport, and further evidence of the bitter divisions it has sparked. The hack appears to be an act of revenge - retaliation for Wada's damning report into Russian state-sponsored cheating. Although the Russian government has denied any involvement, it has always maintained that the country has been made a scapegoat for a much wider problem, and this will only add fuel to that fire. Although the athletes concerned have broken no rules, the revelations - along with the threat of more leaks of other competitors' medical records - will inevitably exacerbate the controversy surrounding TUEs at a time when sport's leaders are desperately trying to restore trust. Many athletes will now be nervously wondering if their private medical details records are the next to be made public. And with the future of Wada currently in the balance, the fact its security was so badly compromised will raise more questions over the entire anti-doping system, especially after the account of Russian whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova was hacked last month, leading to fears for her safety. US Anti-Doping Agency chief Travis Tygart called the hack "cowardly and despicable". "In each of the situations, the athlete has done everything right in adhering to the global rules for obtaining permission to use a needed medication," he said. The US Olympic Committee has had "zero adverse findings from the Rio Olympic Games that weren't 100% within the medical guidelines set forth by anti-doping authorities," spokesman Patrick Sandusky said. Earlier this month, Mr Niggli said Wada was experiencing almost daily cyber attacks originating from Russia. Fancy Bears, which is also known as Tsar Team (APT28), has pledged to release confidential records from other national Olympic teams. How Wada was hacked - Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter It's an old adage in cybersecurity that the weakest point of any supposedly secure system is the people that use it. Wada says it believes this hack was made possible thanks to a successful spearphishing attack. Phishing is a term given to the technique of tricking a user into giving up crucial information - often by clicking a link that takes them to a malicious website disguised as a familiar one, such as the log-in page for a bank or social network. Spearphishing takes this one significant step further. While a phishing attack is often aimed at many people in the hope some will fall for it, spearphishing is highly targeted. Hackers perhaps identified a small number of people, or even just one person, and wrote a phishing attack specifically designed to trick them. Other than pushing a message of vigilance among staff, spearphishing is incredibly difficult to defend against. Attackers often scour the internet, looking for added information on the target that might make an email more believable. Sometimes even knowing a person's favourite football team is enough to tip the balance in making a spearphishing email seem genuine.
The president told a White House news briefing reopening the US early next month would be "a beautiful timeline". Hours later, the Senate agreed a $2 trillion (£1.7tn) economic rescue plan with the White House. The deal will be passed later on Wednesday by the Senate. "At last, we have a deal," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, citing the massive "wartime level of investment into our nation". The package includes tax rebates, loans, money for hospitals and rescue packages for businesses. The House of Representatives still needs to pass the legislation before it is sent to Mr Trump for his signature. The US has recorded almost 55,000 cases and nearly 800 deaths from coronavirus. Globally there have been more than 420,000 cases confirmed and approaching 19,000 deaths. What did President Trump say? On Tuesday, he told Fox News he hoped the country could get back to normal by Easter, which is on the weekend of 12 April. Mr Trump, a Republican, said: "We're going to be opening relatively soon... I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter." He added in a subsequent interview: "Easter is a very special day for me... and you'll have packed churches all over our country." Mr Trump also warned that unless the country reopened for business it could suffer "a massive recession or depression". The president said: "You're going to lose people. You're going to have suicides by the thousands. You're going to have all sorts of things happen. You're going to have instability." Speaking at a White House briefing later, Mr Trump said he was beginning "to see the light at the end of the tunnel", though he said "our decision will be based on hard facts and data". Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading expert on infectious diseases and a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, told the same press briefing: "No-one is going to want to tone down anything when you see what is going on in a place like New York City." What's happening in New York? With more than 25,000 coronavirus cases by Tuesday morning, the Empire state accounted for half of all US infections. Dr Deborah Birx, of the White House coronavirus taskforce, said on Tuesday the New York City metro area is the source of 60% of all new cases in the US. She advised anyone leaving the region to self-quarantine for two weeks. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, told another news conference on Tuesday: "The [infection] forecaster said to me, 'We were looking at a freight train coming across the country.' "'We're now looking at a bullet train.'" He added: "New York is the canary in the coal mine, New York is happening first, what is happening to New York will happen to California and Illinois, it is just a matter of time." The governor said New York's hospital system will soon reach breaking point unless the US Federal Emergency Management Agency urgently sends more healthcare supplies. "You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators," Mr Cuomo said. New York currently has 7,000 medical ventilators - machines used to keep patients breathing - but needs 30,000, the governor said. A tale of two media events On Tuesday afternoon, Donald Trump sat in the verdant White House grounds for a Fox News "virtual town hall" and said he hoped to get US businesses reopened by Easter, in just over two weeks. "A great American resurrection," the Fox host suggested. A few hours earlier, Governor Cuomo held a much more sombre press conference at the Javits Center in Manhattan. The building, which three years ago hosted Hillary Clinton's ill-fated election-night party, is now a makeshift field hospital. The president and the governor - two New Yorkers with a long history - clashed over the state's shortage of ventilators to treat the most serious cases. Mr Trump blamed Mr Cuomo for not purchasing more in 2015, citing a conspiracy-mongering website. Mr Cuomo said the administration should use its emergency powers to order more machines manufactured. When it comes to easing the recent shelter-in-place orders, governors like Mr Cuomo, not the president, will have the final say. If there's disagreement, however, the American public could be left wondering what to believe. What is the current US situation? The US is more than halfway through a 15-day attempt to slow the spread of the virus through social distancing. The voluntary guidelines were issued by a government public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But while the president has been talking of easing restrictions, state and local leaders nationwide have been rapidly ratcheting up controls to contain the infection. On Tuesday, Wisconsin, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Mexico, West Virginia and Indiana introduced stay-at-home orders, bringing the total number of US states under such lockdowns to 17.

They included allegations that the CIA had developed ways to listen in on smartphone and smart TV microphones. The CIA has been criticised by civil rights groups who say the agency "stockpiled" security flaws in devices to use them for its work, but left the population at risk by doing so. "Our digital security has been compromised because the CIA has been stockpiling vulnerabilities rather than working with companies to patch them," said Nathan White, from the civil liberties group Access Now. Should we be worried? "It's not a surprise that people who have a mission to find bad guys and protect nations are using every means at their disposal to gather intelligence on a focused target," said Don Smith from cybersecurity firm SecureWorks. "If the CIA doesn't have capabilities for eavesdropping, it's not doing its job." Alan Woodward, a security researcher who advises Europol and previously advised UK spy agency GCHQ, said the public should be "encouraged" by the information published. "Most of the leaked documents are about targeted attacks. This is not about mass surveillance and vacuuming up a haystack of data to search for a needle," he told the BBC. "They need warrants, they can't just tap in to any phone - it doesn't work like that. One of the reasons people have faith in the security services is that they tend to obey the law, and when they don't it comes out. "If Wikileaks has the code behind these exploits, it has a responsibility not to publish that. To do so would expose the public to the very real danger of criminals reusing those exploits still working. These were kept in a controlled environment for a reason." However, Access Now said the CIA's decision to keep security flaws to itself had "significant repercussions for human rights and digital security". Whistleblower Edward Snowden criticised the scope of the CIA's methods. "Imagine a world where the actual CIA spends its time figuring out how to spy on you through your TV," he wrote on Twitter. "That's today". Are 'smart' devices safe? Homes are becoming increasingly "smart", with everything from light switches to voice-activated kitchen appliances connected to the internet. If unsecured, these could reveal our activities in the home. "The concept that intelligence agencies are doing broad personal surveillance using these devices is not realistic," said Mr Smith. "I would be amazed if that was the case because the resources to make sense of all the data just aren't there. "My concern is much more what online criminals might be able to achieve with these devices. There are plenty of examples of things such as baby monitors being open to the wider internet." The documents published by Wikileaks detail ways in which some Samsung televisions could be used to spy on their owners. Mr Woodward said it was unlikely the exploit was widely used. "They're talking about a few models of Samsung TV. If you read the documents, they have been vulnerable for a while. It would be surprising if the CIA was not looking into that," he said. "Has the CIA remotely hacked them? No. They have to get into your home and plug a USB drive in to them. It's a high risk. If you have to get in to somebody's house you can give yourself away." Mr Woodward said anybody worried that their appliances were spying on them could "unplug them at the wall". That advice may not help those with a modern voice-controlled fridge-freezer, the likes of which have started to go on sale. However, SecureWorks' Mike McLellan, who previously worked at the UK government's National Cyber Security Centre, said the average household should have "bigger concerns". "You are more likely to be a victim of cybercrime or ransomware, than happen to become a subject of interest for an intelligence agency." Can the CIA read my WhatsApp or Signal messages? Encrypted messaging apps offer people some peace of mind that their private messages cannot be intercepted as they travel across the internet, as the messages are scrambled. The CIA documents describe methods to compromise smartphone operating systems such as Android and iOS, which could let agents read messages sent via encrypted services such as WhatsApp and Signal. Mr Woodward said the documents did not suggest the CIA had "cracked" the encryption of either platform. Instead, messages could be read by compromising the "end point" - the sender or receiver's smartphone - where the messages are already decrypted. He said the documents indicated that governments "accept that encryption is going to become commonplace on networks" and that they must focus efforts on "getting in to the end points to read messages". "They know banning encryption is not going to work," he said. Should the CIA have helped fix security flaws? Mr Snowden has described the CIA as "reckless beyond words", for keeping knowledge of security holes in devices such as smartphones to itself. "The CIA reports show the [United States government] developing vulnerabilities in US products, then intentionally keeping the holes open," he wrote on Twitter. "Why is this dangerous? Because until closed, any hacker can use the security hole the CIA left open to break in to any iPhone in the world." Mr Woodward said he was not surprised that the CIA had not disclosed security holes it had found to manufacturers such as Apple and Google. "If your mission is to spy, are you going to tell people something only you know about?" he asked. "This is the CIA, not a computer security agency. If they have [exploits] they are going to use them. It's somebody else's job to fix them." Mr McLellan said it was "a fact of life that intelligence agencies will look for security vulnerabilities", but added that private companies were also searching for flaws and "selling them to the highest bidder". That concerns Mr White, who suggests keeping flaws secret puts ordinary citizens at risk. "It's simply a fantasy to believe that only the 'good guys' will be able to use these tools," he said in a blogpost. "It is critical for governments, law enforcement, technologists, and civil society to have an honest conversation about the impact of government hacking in the digital age." However, Mr Woodward said it was likely that many of the security flaws in the leaked documents had already been fixed. "The idea that the CIA is hoarding [security flaws] is not true. These things are relatively rare... and fixes for them move so quickly that a year or two is almost another era in technical terms," he said. "I would be surprised if they were 'stockpiling' such exploits. I think you'll find they use them while they still can." Will artificial intelligence threaten our privacy? Routine recording of the population would be a huge, and potentially unfeasible, undertaking for an intelligence agency. However, developments in artificial intelligence could make processing data faster and easier. Companies - including Amazon and Google - already sell voice-controlled speakers and smartphones that can understand commands and transcribe speech. Such technology could one day be used to help monitor citizens. "There is the ability to collect telephony en masse now," said Mr Smith. "AI may speed it up and make more sense of the data, but I don't think it's something the average person should be worried about. It could be a future risk, among many future risks." Mr Woodward added: "Think of the volumes of data you'd be dealing with. They don't have the ability to record every phone conversation in the world, let alone every conversation within ear-shot of a phone. "If you're not a person of interest, they just don't have the capacity."
The number of people out of work stood at 121,000 - down 14,000 on the same time last year. Wales' unemployment rate of 8.2% compares with a UK average of 7.8%. Figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) last month showed unemployment fell 7,000 in the three months to August compared to the previous quarter. Welsh Secretary David Jones said the extra 13,000 people in work over the quarter was a sign "that the private sector is beginning to drive growth in Wales". Although there was more to do, he said: "We were right to stabilise the country's economy by focusing on cutting the deficit and allowing businesses greater freedom to develop." The ONS said unemployment fell by 7,000 among men, but rose by 3,000 for women. The number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance rose 700 to 80,700 during October. Meanwhile, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said its members could help tackle unemployment, but they needed clarity about the future of a scheme to help them pay their business rates. Welsh Business Minister Edwina Hart is asking the UK government to extend a rate relief scheme for small businesses beyond March 2013 - something she was urged to do by a review she commissioned. FSB Welsh policy unit chair Janet Jones said: "Given the contribution of the small business community to the employment market, decision-makers in Wales and Westminster must ensure that they are able to thrive." Mrs Hart was due to tell a conference of entrepreneurs in Cardiff on Wednesday that a Welsh government scheme had helped start 4,350 businesses and created more than 10,000 jobs since July 2008. She said unemployment was still too high and that young people in particular needed more help. "The UK government needs to better promote growth as its economic policy based on spending cuts is not working," she said. On Tuesday ministers said Labour's Jobs Growth Wales programme, which offers six-month contracts to under 24-year-olds, had created 4,000 job opportunities since its launch in April. Liberal Democrat AM Eluned Parrott said falling unemployment showed the economy was "healing... but there must be no room for complacency". Plaid Cymru hailed a deal it struck over the Welsh government's budget which secured an extra £20m to spend on creating apprenticeships next year, with the same amount pencilled in for 2014-15.
Steck, who was known as the "Swiss Machine", died in an accident while acclimatising for an attempt on the mountain without oxygen by a new route. The 40-year-old had won multiple awards and was known for his rapid ascents. His body has been recovered from the base of Mount Nupste, which shares a common ridge with Everest, after he was spotted by fellow climbers. "He had an accident on the Nuptse wall and died. It seems he slipped," Ang Tsering Sherpa, head of the Nepal Mountaineering Association, told news agency AFP. Steck was preparing to climb Mount Everest using its West Ridge, a route which has been the cause of more deaths than successful ascents, followed by Lhotse, the fourth highest mountain in the world. It is believed he was alone on Sunday due to his climbing partner contracting severe frostbite. On Wednesday, Steck wrote on his Facebook page that he had a "quick day from Basecamp up to 7,000m and back" as he believed "active acclimatisation" was the most effective way of getting used to high altitude. The climber reached Mount Everest's summit without oxygen in 2012, and in 2015 climbed all 82 Alpine peaks over 4,000m (13,100ft) in 62 days. Steck had returned to the world's tallest mountain four years on from an altercation with sherpas which caused him to abandon an attempt to climb Everest and Lhotse. In a video about his Everest-Lhotse project ahead of his departure for the Himalayas, Steck said he felt super-ready and psyched. "My body is as strong as it was never before," he added. Asked about his definition of success for the ambitious plans to traverse Everest and Lhotse via the Hornbein Couloir, Steck said: "If you have an accident or if you're going to die, that's definitely not successful, all the other things, it's a success already." Ueli Steck - in his own words "Why do I have to attempt Everest and Lhotse? Yet again, the answer is simple: I get to stay longer in the mountains. "And now I'll just go, and only worry about the events that lie ahead of me. Day by day, one by one. It is the here and now that counts. What comes next is uncertain in any case. "Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow." Read more on Ueli Steck's website Last year Steck and fellow climber David Goettler found the bodies of two American mountaineers in Tibet, 16 years after they were killed by a huge avalanche. Veteran British mountaineer Sir Chris Bonington paid tribute to Steck, describing him as "one of the great climbers of all time". He said that Steck's reputation for speed climbing had not necessarily put him at greater risk. "What kills most people is the objective dangers, going into an area where there is stone fall or the threat of avalanche," he told the BBC's Newshour programme. "The longer you are exposed to that threat, statistically the more likelihood there is of you being hit by one of these things. Whereas if you are moving very fast you are exposed to that danger for a much shorter time. "But the people who are climbing at the absolute limit, which he undoubtedly was, the death rate among the very best mountaineers is very high, particularly in the Himalayas." British mountaineer Kenton Cool described Steck as "a true inspiration" who "showed us all what was possible in the mountains and beyond". The British Mountaineering Council described him as a "legendary mountaineer and all-round great guy". YouTube mountaineering star - by Steve Jackson, BBC News Ueli Steck set new standards in alpine climbing - setting a string of records for making breathtakingly quick solo ascents of classic routes. He also played a big part in bringing the sport to a new audience through the epic films made of his exploits. He was nicknamed the "Swiss Machine" for his ruthlessly methodical approach and his ability to keep going even after pushing himself to the limits of human endurance. In 2015 he climbed one of the world's most famous walls, the North Face of the Eiger, in two hours 47 minutes - a time that would have been unthinkable to the early pioneers of the sport, who took days to complete it. In 2015, he improved on that feat with a time of two hours 22 minutes and 50 seconds.
The prince, whose birthday is on Tuesday, was pictured at the Sensational Butterflies exhibition at London's Natural History Museum. The image was taken a few weeks ago by the Press Association's John Stillwell. Prince George's parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are expected to hold a birthday party on Tuesday at their Kensington Palace apartment. Mr Stillwell also photographed the prince's first public appearance the day after he was born and his christening last October. "Prince George was very lively and very sure of himself and confident - a very determined young boy," he said. Prince George Alexander Louis - known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge - was born on 22 July last year.
Witnesses said the rocket was only briefly visible before making its way into the clouds. The launch was made from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rocket booster successfully landed nine minutes after taking off. The touchdown is part of the company's strategy of returning rockets to earth so they can be reused rather than jettisoning them in the ocean after a single launch. Moments after the rocket landed, the SpaceX Dragon supply ship successfully reached orbit, prompting cheers inside the SpaceX Mission Control room. The Dragon is now making its way to the International Space Station, and is expected to arrive on Wednesday. On 14 January SpaceX resumed flights by launching a Falcon 9 vehicle from the Vandenberg Air Force Base on the California coast. It was the first mission by the company since one of its vehicles exploded on the launch pad in September. Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, wants his company to be at the forefront of the race involving several companies to deploy satellite-based internet services over the next few years. The company also has a long queue of customers all waiting for a ride to orbit - including America's civil space agency (Nasa), the US military and multiple outfits in the commercial sector. But September's launch pad mishap was a spectacular reminder of just how unpredictable rockets can be sometimes.
Liow Tiong Lai told the BBC that search teams would keep looking for the aircraft which had been carrying 239 passengers and crew. The Malaysian airliner was on its way from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it vanished. Investigators are due to release a report on the search on Sunday. Australia is leading an international search team in the southern Indian Ocean, approximately 1,600km (1,000 miles) off its west coast. The search Could it have been suicide? What we know How the search is conducted Malaysian police say they are still investigating whether the plane's disappearance was intentional but have not revealed any details of their findings, the BBC's Jennifer Pak reports. Earlier this year, the Malaysian government declared flight MH370 to have been lost with all on board, in a move it said was necessary to start processing compensation claims for the families. But Mr Liow promised his government would continue to back the search operation. "We are confident we can complete the search hopefully by May this year, and we hope we can get the plane," he said. If the scan of the designated search area did not yield any result by May, investigators would go "back to the drawing board", he told AFP news agency. That would mean re-examining all available data that was used to determine the crash zone. Some families of those on board the plane have accused the Malaysian authorities of hiding some information, but the transport minister urged them not to "believe in all the conspiracy theories". "[They] have to believe in data, facts, in... experts who give us the data that shows that - proves that - this plane is in the south Indian Ocean," he said. "And that is why we are focused in that area." The family of the flight's pilot has said there is no evidence to suggest Zaharie Ahmad Shah was responsible for the aircraft's disappearance. His sister, Sakinab Shah, issued a media statement online to deny renewed speculation that her brother had intentionally flown the plane to avoid detection. She said no-one had the right to blame her brother without any proof. Analysis: Jonathan Head, BBC News, Kuala Lumpur Of all the many theories about what happened to MH370, the idea that it might have been diverted to a remote airfield and its passengers taken off, seems the least plausible. What motive could the mysterious hijacker have had? No demands have been made. But it is a theory that Wen Wan Cheng is clinging to with defiant certainty. And who can blame him? The 64 year-old property developer from Shandong had his son, Wen Yong Sheng, on board the ill-fated flight. Until he sees some evidence of what happened to the plane, he believes his son must still be alive. The Malaysian authorities still insist the best theory is that the plane crashed into a remote part of the southern Indian Ocean, after being diverted and flying south for several hours. That is where they are still looking, in 60,000 sq km (23,166 sq m) of sea. But they lost the trust of the families early on due to their clumsy and confused response to the disappearance. The inexplicable absence of any wreckage, one year on, allows relatives to hold on to the near-impossible hope that some of the 239 passengers and crew may have survived.
The firm said it made 74.3bn yuan (£7.8bn; $11.97bn) in pre-tax sales last year, up 135% from 2013. Now the world's third largest smartphone maker behind Samsung and Apple, it sold over 61 million phones last year, up 227% from a year earlier. Last week, Xiaomi received $1.1bn in funding that valued the firm at $45bn. That figure surpasses the $40bn value of taxi booking app Uber, which previously held the title of the most valuable private technology company. The firm also surpassed its target of selling 60 million phones in 2014, up from less than 20 million a year earlier. Looking forward, the company said it planned to unveil a new flagship device in January. 'Starting from scratch' In a translation of a post on chief executive Lei Jun's Sina Weibo microblog on Sunday, the co-founder said the company had come a long way since starting "from scratch" in April 2010. "2014 is a year of important milestones for Xiaomi. We came from behind and became market leader in China," he said. With its business model of producing cheap smartphones, the fast-growing firm overtook global market leader Samsung in sales last year in the world's largest smartphone market, China. Mr Lei, however, does expect growth in the Chinese market to ease this year and plans to enter more overseas markets. "We have successfully entered seven markets outside mainland China. "In India, we sold over 1 million smartphones in less than five months," he said, despite the intellectual property challenges it faced in the country last month. Xiaomi sales were temporarily halted in India after Swedish firm Ericsson filed a patent complaint against it.
By Stephen McDonellBBC News, Beijing The 3,000 or so delegates to China's annual National People's Congress (NPC) endorsed the new law on Friday. They don't oppose legislation. That's not how it is done here. When a vote is taken there are normally only a handful who vote against. Some of them potentially for show, because 100% "yes" votes one after another would look ridiculous. If there is pushback against a draft bill and amendments made, this happens well before the NPC sits, at a series of standing committee meetings behind closed doors. The process can take years. This time it took three months. The Chinese government appears to have rushed through the investment law as an olive branch to the US amid trade war negotiations. However, many in the business community here in China see this law as a kind of sweeping set of intentions rather than a specific, enforceable set of rules. They fear it could be open to different and changing forms of interpretation. The big-ticket items it is said to address, in terms of the concerns of foreign companies, include intellectual property theft, the requirement for international firms to partner up with a local entity, and unfair subsidies to Chinese companies. It will also address the preferential treatment in awarding contracts to Chinese companies, and forcing foreign firms to hand over their technological secrets as the price of entry to the massive Chinese market. But this law isn't going to help everyone. There is a "black list" of 48 sectors that will not be open to foreign investment or, in some cases, not open without conditions or special permission. For example, there is a complete ban on investing in fishing, gene research, religious education, news media, and television broadcasting. Partial investment is allowed in oil and gas exploitation, nuclear power, airlines, airport operation, and public health, amongst others sectors. Non-renewable energy automobile production will require partnerships for a few years but then be phased out. For industries not on the list, the principle is that foreign companies will receive the same treatment as their Chinese counterparts. But should foreign companies also be wary? One of the provisions will include a requirement for the local subsidiaries of international firms to report various details of their operation to Chinese officials. This could include performance indicators relating to labour relations, overall staffing numbers, pollution records and the like. That sounds fine except that foreign companies have asked for - and not received - legal guarantees that this data will not be passed on to their Chinese competitors. Then there is the promised complaints procedure should you seek redress following any perceived violations of the new law. If this system is run through the normal Chinese courts, which routinely guarantee results favourable to the Communist Party, then to many this would not seem like a satisfactory enforcement mechanism. One part of the law specifies that there is to be a ban on "illegal government interference" in the activities of foreign business. The further you go up the government ladder the more implausible it would be to win in such a dispute. Over the years we have reported on many cases of foreign businesspeople, especially ethnic Chinese, who have been sent to prison on highly questionable charges following a commercial dispute with a local business person who enjoys the backing of low-level Communist Party cadres. Those here with long memories know this and are approaching the new law with an understandable level of caution.
It said fellow communications firm ZTE had also been banned, both reportedly because of national security concerns. "This is a extremely disappointing result for consumers," the company said on Twitter. Faster data download and upload speeds are promised with 5G, which is the next stage of mobile internet connectivity. Wider coverage and more stable connections than current 4G technology are also highlighted as benefits. What's the issue? Several countries are preparing for the roll-out of 5G mobile networks, although analysts say few will launch 5G services before 2020. Mark Newman, from the consultancy ConnectivityX, said: "5G is going to be the next significant wave of mobile infrastructure deployment. "If existing suppliers are banned, it will be quite a major blow for them." Huawei is the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment. It also ranks second in global smartphone sales, behind Samsung and ahead of Apple. In July, a UK security committee warned that it had "only limited assurance" that Huawei's telecoms kit posed no threat to national security. The UK's cyber-defence watchdog - the National Cyber Security Centre - has also warned that the use of ZTE's equipment and services could pose a national security risk. "As we move into 5G, a greater proportion of the network is controlled by software," said Mr Newman. "There is an argument that in this software realm, concerns about who is managing the network and where from are heightened." What has Australia said? On Thursday, the Australian government said national security regulations that were typically applied to telecoms firms would be extended to equipment suppliers. Companies that were "likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government" could present a security risk, it said. The United States has previously banned Huawei from bidding for government contracts because of fears over espionage. ZTE has also had its activity restricted in the US. Under Chinese law, companies must co-operate with the intelligence services. Analysts therefore warn that equipment produced by firms such as Huawei and ZTE could be compromised. How has China responded? China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said Australia should not "use various excuses to artificially erect barriers". It called on Australia to "abandon ideological prejudices and provide a fair competitive environment for Chinese companies". Huawei has defended the security of its products. "Huawei is a world leader in 5G," the company said in a statement. It said it had "safely and securely" delivered wireless technology in Australia for close to 15 years.
By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The German primary school teacher is said to be in her 21st week of pregnancy and feeling "fit". If her pregnancy progresses well, as hoped, Ms Raunigk will be the oldest to give birth to quadruplets, but not the oldest mum to give birth to a child - that official record is held by Maria del Carmen Bousada Lara, who give birth to twins in Spain in 2006, at the age of 66, although some say it belongs to Omkari Panwar, who is believed to have been 70 when she gave birth to twins in India in 2008. How are these "elderly" pregnancies medically possible? Donor eggs Women who have gone through the menopause will not be able to get pregnant without help. They will need to use eggs from a donor - or a frozen stash of their own eggs - to be able to conceive. For women, fertility declines with age, and this is fairly rapid after the age of 35, although it will vary for the individual. It's all down to eggs. Girls are born with all of the eggs they will ever have, and after puberty they begin to lose them as they menstruate. By the age of about 40, a woman's supply of good quality eggs will be dwindling. Hormones Before the fertilised donor egg can be used, doctors will need to make sure the woman's womb is ready to receive and nurture it. Doctors can give the woman a short course of oestrogen therapy to thicken the lining of her womb and prepare the environment for the embryo. Once the fertilised egg has been transferred into the womb, the woman will need to take more hormones to support the pregnancy - unlike younger women with fully functioning ovaries, she won't be able to make the hormones herself. Dr Sue Avery, a fertility expert at the Birmingham Women's Fertility Centre and a member of the British Fertility Society, says: "It's pretty much the same process as we would use for a younger woman who, for some reason, has had to have her ovaries removed." Close monitoring Dr Avery says older expectant mothers do need a careful watch because they are at higher risk of pregnancy-related complications such as high blood pressure and gestational diabetes. But when the donor egg comes from a younger woman, this may change things. Dr Avery says: "Although the woman is older, because the eggs are from a younger woman and the pregnancy is supported hormonally, it's like a younger person's pregnancy really." A US study of 101 older expectant mothers found the risk of pregnancy complications for women over 50 who became pregnant via egg donation were similar to those of younger women conceiving in this way. Ultimately, it comes down to how physically fit the mother is, not just her age. Arguably, the most significant risk factor in Ms Raunigk's pregnancy is the number of babies she is carrying, says Dr Avery. Multiple pregnancies - twins, triplets, quads or more - are always deemed higher risk by doctors. It increases the likelihood of premature delivery and smaller birth weight, as well as dangerous complications for the mother, including high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia. Caesarean delivery Carrying four babies means it is unlikely that Ms Raunigk will give birth naturally, and she will instead deliver by Caesarean section. The 65-year-old is already a mother to 13 other children - she gave birth to her youngest daughter a decade ago. Her physician, Dr Kai Hertwig, was quoted by German Broadcaster RTL as saying that quadruple pregnancies were always a strain, but everything was going well for Ms Raunigk. Aftercare Like any new parent, for the first few months Ms Raunigk will face the challenge of coping with little sleep while having to change lots of nappies. Then there will be the future to plan for. Dr Avery says: "If she has four babies at 65, she will soon be chasing round four toddlers. Good luck to her! "Even if you are fit, you do not have the same energy at the age of 45 as at 25, let alone at 65." Dr Avery says few clinics in the UK offer IVF treatment to women over the age of 50, for social reasons. "We have to consider the welfare of the child when making a decision," she says. She says it is up to individual clinics to decide if a woman, who at the age of 65 might reasonably expect to live for another 20 years or so, should be eligible for treatment. "There is no regulation that says you can't treat a woman older than a certain age," she says. "There is no upper age, but you will need to take into account the welfare of the child."
In the wake of last week's report we are looking at ways that people are tackling this issue. How can we solve the issue? It could be a simple change in your day to day routine or an advance in the world of business or technological innovation. Thank you for sending your ideas for solutions, we are now investigating.
David ShukmanScience editor Nuclear war, global warming and genetically-engineered viruses are among the scenarios he singles out. And he says that further progress in science and technology will create "new ways things can go wrong". Prof Hawking is giving this year's BBC Reith Lectures, which explore research into black holes, and his warning came in answer to audience questions. He says that assuming humanity eventually establishes colonies on other worlds, it will be able to survive. "Although the chance of a disaster to planet Earth in a given year may be quite low, it adds up over time, and becomes a near certainty in the next thousand or ten thousand years. "By that time we should have spread out into space, and to other stars, so a disaster on Earth would not mean the end of the human race. "However, we will not establish self-sustaining colonies in space for at least the next hundred years, so we have to be very careful in this period." Reith Lectures: Prof Stephen Hawking Prof Hawking's first Reith Lecture will be broadcast on 26 January and on 2 February at 9am on BBC Radio 4. BBC World Service listeners can tune in on 26 January at 15:06 GMT and 2 February at 15:06 GMT or catch up online via www.bbc.com/worldserviceradio BBC News online will be publishing the text of Prof Hawking's lectures with accompanying notes by our science editor, David Shukman. iWonder: A brief history of Stephen Hawking It is ironic that such a prominent figure in science identifies scientific progress itself as the major source of new threats. On previous occasions, he has highlighted the potential risks of artificial intelligence (AI) becoming powerful enough to cause the extinction of the human race. But he insists that ways will be found to cope. "We are not going to stop making progress, or reverse it, so we have to recognise the dangers and control them. I'm an optimist, and I believe we can." Asked for advice for young scientists, Prof Hawking said they should retain a sense of wonder about "our vast and complex" Universe. "From my own perspective, it has been a glorious time to be alive and doing research in theoretical physics. There is nothing like the Eureka moment of discovering something that no one knew before." But he also said that future generations of researchers should be aware of how scientific and technological progress is changing the world, and to help the wider public understand it. "It's important to ensure that these changes are heading in the right directions. In a democratic society, this means that everyone needs to have a basic understanding of science to make informed decisions about the future. "So communicate plainly what you are trying to do in science, and who knows, you might even end up understanding it yourself." Since his diagnosis with motor neurone disease, Prof Hawking's determination to overcome the immense physical challenges of his disability has been a source of worldwide admiration and fascination. His daughter Lucy, a journalist and writer, who has co-written children's science books with Prof Hawking, was asked to explain his drive. "I think he's enormously stubborn and has a very enviable wish to keep going and the ability to summon all his reserves, all his energy, all his mental focus and press them all into that goal of keeping going," she said. "But not just to keep going for the purposes of survival, but to transcend this by producing extraordinary work, writing books, giving lectures, inspiring other people with neurodegenerative and other disabilities, and being a family man, a friend and a colleague to so many people and keeping up with friends across the world."

The deal, which values the firm at A$370.7m (£201m; $289m), still needs approval from Australian and Chinese regulatory bodies. A takeover had previously been blocked by Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB). It was concerned that part of the property was inside a military weapons testing range in South Australia. Kidman has since taken the Anna Creek farm out of the sale. Dakang Australia is to acquire 80% of the farm, while local partner Australian Rural Capital (ARC) will take the remaining 20%. The sale comprises of areas covering 77,300sq/km - equal to 1% of Australia or an area bigger than Ireland. Chinese market focus Kidman chairman John Crosby said that the deal complied "with all the requests that have been made by the FIRB and we believe the sale will secure the long-term future of the Kidman enterprise." He also recommended shareholders to accept the consortium's offer. Gary Romano of Dakang Australia and James Jackson of ARC said they "intend to continue investing where it is required to improve productivity and performance, apply our insights into the rapidly growing Chinese market, and bring proven know-how in the development of integrated supply chains and marketing models." Dakang Australia's Chinese parent company is Hunan Dakang Pasture Farming, a private Chinese company which also has major stakes in New Zealand's dairy industry. Its majority shareholder is Shanghai Pengxin which had already been among the previous bidders for the Kidman territory.
The Tibetan spiritual leader, 81, met Naren Chandra Das, 79, as he paid a visit to northeast India. "Looking at your face, I now realise I must be very old too," he said. He first met the guard in 1959 after a gruelling two-week trek across the mountains from Lhasa, after a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule. Disguised as a soldier, the Dalai Lama made his way with a small entourage to the border, having received assurances of Indian help. Mr Das, a retired member of the Assam Rifles, said: "Guards of the Assam Rifles Platoon No 9 had brought the Dalai Lama from Zuthangbo and handed him over to five of us at Shakti [in Arunachal Pradesh, which borders China and Bhutan]. "We brought him to Lungla from where he was escorted on his onward journey to Tawang by another group of guards," he said. Troops had not been allowed to talk to the Tibetan spiritual leader. "Our duty was only to guard and escort him during his journey," he said. The Dalai Lama thanked the former soldier, saying he was "very, very happy" to meet part of the team that escorted him to safety inside India. After his escape, he stayed briefly at the Tawang monastery, before settling in Dharamsala, in the north of the country, which is now home to the Tibetan government-in-exile. Later this week he will visit the monastery to deliver teachings. His visit has angered China, which maintains that Arunachal Pradesh is part of its territory. Ahead of the visit, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman urged India to "avoid taking any actions that would further complicate the border issue, [and to] not provide a platform for the 14th Dalai clique's separatist activities". The Dalai Lama, meanwhile, said on Saturday that returning to the northeast of India felt "like a reunion". "When I revisit the Tawang area, I am reminded of the freedom that I had experienced for the first time [in 1959]. That was the beginning of a new chapter in my life," the Associated Press news agency quoted him as saying.
Latest figures show net migration rose to 176,000 - up from 153,000 people in the year to September 2012. The increase appears to buck the trend of a decline in net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to and leaving the country. Prime Minister David Cameron wants to get UK net migration below 100,000 before the next election in 2015. The increase was driven by a change in the number of people who left Britain. In the year to September 2012, 342,000 moved abroad. But fewer people left the UK in the year to December 2012. Over the same period, the number of immigrants arriving in the country remained virtually unchanged. The difference between these two factors meant that net migration rose - although it did not climb back above the level it was at in December 2011. 'Out of options' Immigration minister Mark Harper said net migration was however down by a third since its peak in 2010. He added that a new immigration bill coming into force in the autumn would make it more difficult for people to come into Britain if they had no right to do so and would make it easier to remove people who were not entitled to stay in the country. "We are committed to bringing net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands," Mr Harper said. "We are working across government to protect public services and ensure our welfare system is not open to abuse." Shadow immigration minister Chris Bryant said the figures were "a blow" to the home secretary. "Theresa May's focus on net migration, which has gone wrong in these figures, has also meant the government is failing badly on illegal immigration, which is a major concern to the public and is getting worse and worse with fewer people being stopped at the border, absconsions up and deportations down. "Immigration needs to be controlled, but we must recognise there is immigration that works for Britain and immigration that doesn't." But the pressure group Migrationwatch UK said that the detail of the latest figures showed the government was succeeding in cutting immigration from outside the EU - and that further reductions in net migration could come by ensuring that people leave when they should. Sir Andrew Green, Migrationwatch's chairman, said: "It is far too early on the basis of one quarter's figures to call this a setback to the government's policy. Student interviews and measures to ensure that students leave when they should will make a substantial difference." Sarah Mulley, of the centre-left think tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research, said the statistics suggested the government was running out of options to meet its target. "Recent declines have been driven in large part by falling numbers of international students, which has come at a high economic cost, but this trend now appears to be levelling off," she said. Other figures released in the report include:
The slight increase moves the rate, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), above its recent five-year low. The Office for National Statistics (ONS), said the marginal rise was because transport costs fell by less than they did a year ago. In addition, prices in the recreation and culture sectors rose, particularly for computer games and toys. However, the price of food and non-alcoholic beverages fell by 1.4% in October, when compared with last year, marking the sixth consecutive month without a rise - the longest such period since 2000. Furniture and household equipment prices also fell, by 1.1%, most notably three-piece suites and settees. In a separate development on Tuesday, retail analysts Kantar Worldpanel said UK grocery sales had fallen for the first time in twenty years. It said price competition had pushed down grocery prices by 0.4%. The ONS also reported that the Retail Prices Index grew by 2.3% in the year to the end of October, the same rate as recorded for September. Seasonal factors Last week, the Bank of England warned the inflation rate could dip to as low as 1% in the coming six months. However, the small rise in the rate of inflation is unlikely to alter the central bank's decision to keep its key interest rate at 0.5% for the time being. The Bank targets an inflation rate of 2%. The BBC's economics editor, Robert Peston, said the small rise seemed largely due to seasonal factors, such as the timing of student fee increases and sales of Christmas games, and that the overall trend for the CPI was probably still downwards. Reacting to the ONS report, David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce said that despite the small increase, "the impact of low oil prices will have a noticeable impact in coming months, causing inflation to drop". "We expect inflation to fluctuate around 1% until late 2015, before rising towards 2.0% in 2016," he added.
Riot police fired tear gas after migrants began throwing boulders inside the camp. At least 12 shacks were set ablaze, reports say. The demolition teams appeared to leave inhabited huts intact as they move through the camp's southern sector. The government plans to relocate migrants to reception centres. Those living in the camp, mainly from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa, hope to cross the Channel, often using people traffickers to try to enter illegally. At the scene: Anna Holligan, BBC News, Calais Hidden by the cover of darkness, groups of migrants tried to access trucks on the motorway heading towards the port of Calais. Riot police fired tear gas, forcing them back. On Monday the demolition squads moved through the Jungle. They were met by some resistance. A few migrants and protesters threw rocks in an effort to delay their eviction. Little remains of the sprawling southern section of the settlement now. The government is trying to encourage people to relocate to official accommodation provided inside converted shipping containers nearby. But most have refused the offer, fearing they'll be forced to claim asylum in France. It's still unclear where the hundreds who've been evicted will go now. They fear the changes mean they will be forced to give their fingerprints and claim asylum in France, dashing their dreams of reaching the UK. The authorities believe some 1,000 migrants will be affected by the eviction plan while aid agencies say the number of people living there is much higher. 'Iron bars' Clashes continued on Monday evening as groups of migrants fanned out across scrubland towards the motorway heading to the port of Calais, reports the BBC's Anna Holligan at the camp. French media say about 150 people, some wielding iron bars, climbed onto the road to block vehicles. Riot police pushed them back into the camp. Earlier water cannon were also used to extinguish a fire in the shacks at the camp. About 100 homes were dismantled on Monday, with demolition teams expected to return the next morning, our correspondent says. At least four people, including activists from the UK-based No Borders group, were arrested during the unrest, police say. 'No access' Earlier Good Chance, a theatre group which works in the camp, said police were preventing volunteers from entering the camp. "No volunteers access," it said in a tweet. "People removed from houses. Police blocking entry. This is what they call a 'soft demolition'." French officials say public areas in the camp such as places of worship or schools will not be affected and describe the clearance as a "humanitarian operation". Conditions in the southern sector are squalid and the camp's sprawling presence has become a controversial issue in both France and the UK. The Jungle in numbers Tea, rivalry and ambition at 'Jungle hotel' Jungle migrants prepare to move Migrants resist relocation to containers Officials say migrants can either move into heated container accommodation in the northern sector of the camp, where there is room for 1,500 people, move to similar accommodation centres elsewhere in France or claim asylum in France. But many residents are reluctant to leave the Calais area. "Going to Britain... is what people [here] want," Afghan migrant Hayat Sirat told AP. "So destroying part of the jungle is not the solution."
Vernon Unsworth, who helped rescue 12 boys trapped in a Thai cave last year, is suing for defamation. Mr Musk, the first to testify at the court, said Mr Unsworth had insulted him, so he had insulted him back. The 48-year-old said the "pedo guy" tweet had not been meant to be taken literally. Mr Unsworth's legal team have described Mr Musk's now-deleted tweet as "vile and false" and are seeking unspecified punitive damages. The Tesla and SpaceX billionaire posted the message after Mr Unsworth publicly rejected his proposal to use a mini-submarine to rescue the boys, members of a football team who became trapped deep inside a cave in northern Thailand in June 2018 in a case that captured the world's attention. But in an interview on CNN after the successful rescue, Mr Unsworth called the idea a "PR stunt" and suggested the American "stick his submarine where it hurts". Two days later, Mr Musk wrote a series of tweets including one describing Mr Unsworth as a "pedo guy". In his court testimony, Mr Musk - who has 29.8 million Twitter followers - said Mr Unsworth's comments were "wrong and insulting, and so I insulted him back", adding: "It was an unprovoked attack on what was a good-natured attempt to help the kids." He said he had thought Mr Unsworth "was just some random creepy guy" and "unrelated to the rescue", and that he had not expected the tweet to be taken literally. "I assume he didn't mean to sodomise me with a submarine... Just as I didn't literally mean he was a paedophile." The Tesla boss apologised to the cave diver in court, looking directly at him and saying: "I apologised in a tweet and again in the deposition, and I'll say it again: I apologise to Mr Unsworth." Mr Unsworth did not testify on Tuesday. Mr Musk's lawyer, Alex Spiro, said in his opening statements that the term "pedo guy" was a common insult in South Africa, where the billionaire grew up, meaning "creepy old man", and described the messages as "joking, taunting tweets in a fight between men". But Lin Wood, a lawyer for Mr Unsworth, tried to show that Mr Musk had meant what he said by citing a separate tweet in which Mr Musk, after being questioned about the allegation by other users, said, "Bet ya a signed dollar it's true." That tweet was also later deleted. Then, in an email exchange with a Buzzfeed reporter who had contacted him for comments on a threat of a legal case by Mr Unsworth, Mr Musk said, "Stop defending child rapists." In the packed courtroom, Mr Musk also acknowledged paying $52,000 (£40,000) to a man who had posed as a private detective to dig up information on Mr Unsworth after it became clear he would be sued. The investigator turned out to be a conman, Mr Musk said. Mr Musk's comments on Twitter have been controversial on other occasions and in April he reached a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over his tweets, which also puts a restriction on his use of the platform. The judge has denied the defence's request to define Mr Unsworth as a "public figure" - meaning lawyers for Mr Unsworth do not have to prove Mr Musk acted with "actual malice", lowering the bar necessary to win the case.
In creating a separate company that is made up of its stake in Alibaba, Yahoo will avoid a large tax bill. Yahoo also reported fourth-quarter earnings of $166m (£109m), a 52% decrease from a year earlier. The company said revenue from display advertising fell by 4% to $532m from a year earlier. However, investors were cheered by the company's decision to spin-off its Alibaba stake. Shares in Yahoo increased by more than 6% in trading after US markets closed. According to a release, Yahoo's remaining 384 million shares of Alibaba - worth about $40bn - will be owned by a newly registered company called SpinCo. SpinCo shares will then be given to existing Yahoo shareholders. Renewed focus By spinning-off the Alibaba shares into a separate company, Yahoo's chief executive Marissa Mayer will please investors - but also put renewed focus on her efforts to turn around the company. Since taking over in 2012, Ms Mayer has led a string of high-profile acquisitions - most notably that of blogging platform Tumblr - but the company has still struggled to find other streams of revenue as its primacy as a search destination declines. "I'm pleased to report that our performance in Q4 and in 2014 continues to show stability in our core business," she said in a statement. "Our mobile strategy and focus has transformed Yahoo and yielded significant results," she added, noting that the company's mobile ad revenue was $1.26bn in 2014. Fighting fakes Separately, on Wednesday, a Chinese regulator accused Alibaba of not paying enough attention to illegal businesses conducted on its e-commerce websites and failing to take measures to eliminate issues such as the sale of fake goods. The report was based on a meeting between Alibaba and government regulators in July before the company's record breaking share flotation in September. Last month, Alibaba reported that it spent more than $160m (£103m) fighting fake goods on its websites between the beginning of 2013 and November 2014.
By Helier CheungBBC News "The representation of East Asians tends to be stereotypical, or involve racist tropes (in TV and theatre)," says actress Lucy Sheen. "Women are generally depicted as slim, petite, long-haired, submissive 'lotus blossom' types, prostitutes, or illegal immigrants, while East Asian men are portrayed as asexual or effeminate." East Asian actors are rarely cast in non-race specific roles, and are frequently expected to put on a Chinese accent when acting, and yet many producers consider "Yellowface" - casting white actors as Chinese characters - to be acceptable, she adds. The playwright and actress, who has acted in Call the Midwife and EastEnders, is one of several writers to be featured in a new anthology, Foreign Goods. The book, which launches at Asia House on Thursday, is said to be the first collection of modern dramatic writing by British East Asian writers. When white actors play other races Katie Leung: I've yet to play non-Chinese role Why assume an Asian woman is the nanny? It is edited by Jingan Young, an award-winning writer who says there is "a clear dearth of East Asian stories and voices on national stages". "Representation is important because it shapes your perceptions," she argues. "You do learn behaviours off television, art and books, especially at a young age." 'Double standard' The sense that British East Asians are not being authentically portrayed in arts and entertainment is shared by many. Harry Potter actress Katie Leung has previously told the BBC that tackling stereotypes is "a challenge", while Humans star Gemma Chan told The Telegraph: "You are more likely to see an alien in a Hollywood film than an Asian woman." Leung and Chan were among the dozens of people who protested outside London's Print Room theatre last year, after its production of In the Depths of Dead Love, a play set in China, used an all-white cast. Dr Ashley Thorpe, a senior lecturer in drama, theatre and dance at Royal Holloway University, says there has been a "long historical discriminatory practice" against British East Asian actors. "We're talking about the kind of practice that would be unthinkable for other ethnicities - for example, the idea of a white actor playing a black role by donning costume and make-up would be completely unthinkable." There is a "double standard" when it comes to East Asian representation, he says. Companies often cite colour-blind casting or the "universality" of a play as a defence, "but at the same time, British East Asian actors aren't being incorporated into other areas". "There's a sense that they are only allowed to play themselves in a certain kind of way - often involving Pidgin English or being an immigrant." Turning point? There are no clear statistics on the opportunities available to British East Asians, or how they are represented. It's a source of frustration for Dr Thorpe, who says he has applied for funding to conduct studies in this area "numerous times", but been "told it's not a priority". However, he cites several recent theatre productions as examples: Racism against British Chinese 'ignored' Hollywood 'whitewashing'? Casting an Asian-American blockbuster TV stereotypes Actors say the furore over Orphan of Zhao in 2012 marked a turning point in theatre. "It increased our visibility," Daniel York, who has performed for the Royal Court, National Theatre and RSC, says, adding that the situation is "definitely improving". In 2017, the RSC production of Snow in Midsummer, a Chinese classical drama, featured a large ensemble of east Asian actors. And York points to a number of 2018 theatre productions involving East Asian actors and writers, including The Great Wave, Into the Numbers, and Acceptance. However, he argues there is still a "huge" problem on TV, where East Asians tend to be depicted as "a kind of exotic other" or "thuggish brutes, dull, or stern patriarchs". One episode of Sherlock featured a Chinese criminal gang disguised as a circus troupe, while Chinese Burn, a recent BBC Three commission, was accused of perpetuating stereotypes after it featured jokes about eating dogs, and sexually inept Chinese men. Many argue that the US entertainment industry is ahead of the UK when it comes to minority representation. Sitcom Fresh off the Boat was praised for its depiction of a Taiwanese-American family, while My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend cast an East Asian as the male romantic lead - something critics noted was unusual. And while Hollywood films such as Ghost in the Shell and Doctor Strange have been accused of "whitewashing", observers say things are also moving in a positive direction, with the casting of a Chinese actress as Mulan, and an all-Asian cast in Crazy Rich Asians. Actor quits film over 'whitewashing' Marvel star slates 'racist' Hollywood Historical dramas 'limit UK black actors' In the UK, Dr Thorpe argues there is less awareness of racial politics surrounding East Asians, compared to Black and South Asian groups. "British East Asians are considered a neoliberal, multicultural success story," so people are often unaware of the racism that they do encounter, he says. "They are characterised as being content, hard working at school, and with nothing to complain about." But York says this is precisely why British East Asians should continue speaking up. "We've been very good at edging ourselves out of the race and diversity debate [until now]... the trouble is, if you don't make a noise you'll get sidelined and ignored."
The company stopped sales of its iPhones, iPads and other products in the country after a day in which the currency went into free-fall. The rouble has lost more than 20% this week, despite a dramatic decision to raise interest rates from 10.5% to 17%. By afternoon trade the rouble was flat with one dollar buying 68 roubles. Its all time low, set on Wednesday, saw one dollar buying as many as 79 roubles. Apple last month increased its prices in Russia by 20% after the weakening rouble left products in the country cheaper than in the rest of Europe. Russia's central bank said on Wednesday it had spent almost $2bn intervening in the currency market on Monday. It has spent around $80bn trying to prop up its rouble this year, but despite that, the currency has lost more than half its value against the dollar since January, with cheaper oil and Western sanctions over its stance over Ukraine the chief factors. Both of these have weakened the Russian economy. Russia's central bank has pledged fresh further measures to try to stabilise its currency, with First Deputy Governor Sergei Shvetsov describing the situation as "critical". The rouble's slide this week was prompted by fears that the US was considering a fresh set of sanctions against the country for its support for separatists in Ukraine.
Linda YuehChief business correspondent There are 21 Asian countries that signed up last October to set up the AIIB. That has risen to 27, with the launch expected at the end of the year. It has about $50bn in capital, which is only a fifth of what the World Bank holds and also less than the Asian Development Bank. But, it's solely focused on the huge gap in infrastructure funding unlike the other IFIs which fund everything related to development. So, why does the UK want to join? Well, it's not unusual for major economies to become a part of regional development banks. The UK is a member of the Caribbean Development Bank, for instance. But, the China-US tensions behind the AIIB make this one more of a geo-political headache that's now playing out in headlines. America has reportedly urged other nations to step back from the AIIB. Officially at least, the US says that it's a sovereign matter for the UK but has repeatedly called for higher governance standards in the AIIB as befits a multilateral institution. When I asked the President of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, about the AIIB last year, he said that more money for infrastructure would be welcome and that they were working closely with the Chinese on the governance of the AIIB. Rise of AIIB The rise of a development bank led by China can also be viewed as a reaction to the slow reforms of the existing Western-dominated IFIs. The US has an effective veto in the IMF and the head of the World Bank is typically American, while the head of the IMF is European. After years of negotiation, which sped up when emerging economies were asked to supply funds during the 2008 global financial crisis, the stake-holdings have shifted more toward China and other developing countries but the IMF and World Bank are still largely Western-led. There was a push to create an Asian IMF after the 1998 Asian financial crisis which was defeated at the time. But now, China is a much more powerful nation and the world's second largest economy wants to lead its own IFI. It's a tricky task to align oneself with both China and the US. The Americans are apparently unhappy with the UK, while China has welcomed the British application. It may be a pragmatic move, but it's hard not to offend one side or another. I suspect this will be the first of many decisions to be taken by countries such as the UK to position themselves between the new economic superpower and the existing one. The trick will be to come away with economic advantage at minimal political cost. We'll find out if this one will pay off for the UK.
Italians have nicknamed him "Forrest Gump" on social media, after the slow-witted hero of a 1994 movie, played by Tom Hanks, who runs thousands of miles across the United States. Police stopped the Italian's epic walk at 2am in Fano on the Adriatic coast, a week after he left Como in the north. The man, 48, got a €400 (£362; $485) police fine for breaching the curfew. The story was first reported by the Bologna-based newspaper Il Resto del Carlino but quickly went viral in Italian media. Some comments on social media presented the man as heroic and criticised the fine. One said he should have been rewarded - not fined - and given a new pair of shoes. Another praised him for walking off to cool his anger, rather than resorting to violence. The man told police "I came here on foot, I didn't use any transport". He said "along the way I met people who offered me food and drink". "I'm OK, just a bit tired," he said, having averaged 60km daily. Police found him wandering aimlessly and cold at night on a coastal highway. After checking his ID in their database they found that his wife had reported him missing, so they contacted her and she travelled to Fano to collect him. The Italian reports did not say how she reacted upon learning that he had picked up a €400 fine. More on coronavirus lockdown: WATCH: How Italians struggled with lockdown in April:
By Chris Fox & Leo KelionTechnology reporters, BBC News The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said the hackers "almost certainly" operated as "part of Russian intelligence services". It did not specify which organisations had been targeted, or whether any information had been stolen. But it said vaccine research had not been hindered by the hackers. Russia has denied responsibility. "We do not have information about who may have hacked into pharmaceutical companies and research centres in Great Britain. We can say one thing - Russia has nothing at all to do with these attempts," said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin, according to the Tass news agency. The warning was published by an international group of security services: One expert said it was "plausible" that, despite the Kremlin's denials, Russian spies were involved. "The received wisdom is that in cyber-space, attribution is difficult but not impossible," commented Emily Taylor from the Chatham House think tank. "Usually the security services are much more hedgy in their language if they think there is any doubt. "Cozy Bear [the named group] has been implicated in past cyber-attacks and has left quite a trail, and there are fairly good links to the Russian state itself." In recent years, Western security agencies have become more willing to call out hackers targeting companies and organisations in their countries in the hope it will deter them. But the latest accusations are more unusual since officials are directly pointing the finger at Russian spies rather than talking generally about "state-backed hackers" or using other more cautious references. And they are also challenging them over targeting something that the general public recognises as being highly sensitive - coronavirus vaccine research - rather than simply some company or government department's information. However, on another level we should not be too surprised by the claim. Understanding vaccine research and other details about the pandemic has become a top target for intelligence agencies around the world and many others, including Western spies, are likely to be active in this space. The UK, US and Canadian agencies said the hackers had exploited software flaws to get access to vulnerable computer systems, and had used malware called WellMess and WellMail to upload and download files from infected machines. They are also said to have tricked individuals into handing over login credentials with spear-phishing attacks. But one cyber-security expert said the Russians were unlikely to be the only ones involved in such a campaign. "They have lots of people, we have lots of people, the Americans have even more people, as do the Chinese," commented Prof Ross Anderson from the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory. "They are all trying to steal this kind of stuff all the time." Who is accused of being responsible? The NCSC calls out a hacking group called APT29, also known as The Dukes or Cozy Bear. It says it is more than 95% certain that the group is part of the Russian intelligence services. Cozy Bear was first identified as being a significant "threat actor" in 2014, according to the American cyber-security firm Crowdstrike. It describes the group as being "aggressive" in its tactics and "nothing if not flexible, changing tool sets frequently". The unit has previously been implicated in hacking the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) during the US Presidential election in 2016. In 2017, it attacked Norway's Labour Party, defence and foreign ministries, as well as the country's national security service. The report includes recommendations that can help protect organisations from cyber-attacks. "Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organisations involved in Covid-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of Covid-19 vaccines," it said. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: "It is completely unacceptable that the Russian intelligence services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic. "While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behaviour, the UK and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health." On Thursday, the UK government also said Russians had "almost certainly" sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election through illicitly-acquired documents. "We worked very closely with our allies to ensure we would take measures to keep that information safe," said White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany, "and we continue to do so and we are aware of those activities." What else has the US said? by Tara McKelvey in Washington DC "The National Security Agency, along with our partners, remains steadfast in its commitment to protecting national security by collectively issuing this critical cyber-security advisory as foreign actors continue to take advantage of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic," said NSA cyber-security director Anne Neuberger. Earlier in 2020, John Demers, an assistant attorney general for US national security, warned that hackers working for foreign governments were trying to steal vaccine research. He said that the first nation to find a vaccine first will gain clout on the world stage with a "significant geopolitical success story". For that reason, hackers have been pursuing vaccine research in several countries. Demers and others who work in US intelligence have been watching their activities closely. Now, intelligence experts know more about the goals of the hackers and how they using spear-phishing and malware to get what they want.
Latest figures from Cancer Research UK show smoking is the biggest avoidable risk factor, followed by unhealthy diets. The charity is urging people to consider their health when making New Year resolutions. Limiting alcohol intake and doing regular exercise is also good advice. According to the figures spanning five years from 2007 to 2011, more than 300,000 cases of cancer recorded were linked to smoking. Key risk factors A further 145,000 were linked to unhealthy diets containing too much processed food. Obesity contributed to 88,000 cases and alcohol to 62,200. Sun damage to the skin and physical inactivity were also contributing factors. Prof Max Parkin, a Cancer Research UK statistician based at Queen Mary University of London, said: "There's now little doubt that certain lifestyle choices can have a big impact on cancer risk, with research around the world all pointing to the same key risk factors. "Of course everyone enjoys some extra treats during the Christmas holidays so we don't want to ban mince pies and wine but it's a good time to think about taking up some healthy habits for 2015. "Leading a healthy lifestyle can't guarantee someone won't get cancer but we can stack the odds in our favour by taking positive steps now that will help decrease our cancer risk in future." Public Health England says a healthy lifestyle can play a vital role in reducing cancer risk. It says campaigns such as Smokefree, Dry January and Change4Life Sugar Swaps all aim to raise public awareness.
By Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Menopause is a natural part of ageing which normally happens between the ages of 45 and 55, but can also be brought on by surgery to remove the ovaries or the womb (hysterectomy). In the UK, the average age of menopause is 51. So what's behind the change? Hormones, specifically one called oestrogen. It is crucial to the whole monthly reproductive cycle - the development and release of an egg from the ovaries each month for fertilisation and the thickening of the lining of the womb ready to accept the fertilised egg. But as women age and their store of eggs declines, ovulation, periods and pregnancies stop. And the body gradually stops producing oestrogen, which controls the whole process. This doesn't happen overnight though. It can take several years for this crucial hormone to fall to low levels - and then it stays that way. What impact do hormone changes have? Massive ones. The brain, skin, muscles and emotions are all affected by falling levels of oestrogen. The body can start to behave very differently and many women experience symptoms long before their periods actually stop - during what is called the peri-menopause. Hot flushes, night sweats, sleep problems, anxiety, low mood and loss of interest in sex are common. Bladder problems and vaginal dryness are also normal during this time. When oestrogen production stops altogether, there is a long-term effect on the bones and heart. Bones can weaken, making fractures more likely, and women can become more vulnerable to heart disease and stroke. That's why women are offered hormone replacement therapy, or HRT, which boosts oestrogen levels and helps to relieve symptoms. But not all women experience symptoms. They can also vary in their severity and how long they last - from a few months to several years. So what causes hot flushes? A lack of oestrogen. It is involved in the workings of the body's thermostat in the brain. Normally, the body copes well with temperature changes, but when oestrogen is lacking, the thermostat goes wonky and the brain thinks the body is overheating when it's not. Does oestrogen affect mood too? Yes, it can do. The hormone interacts with chemicals in brain receptors which control mood, and at low levels it can cause anxiety and low mood. A lack of oestrogen can also affect the skin, making it feel dry or as if insects are crawling under the skin. Are other hormones involved? Yes, progesterone and testosterone - but they don't have the same impact as low levels of oestrogen. Progesterone helps to prepare the body for pregnancy every month, and it declines when periods stop. Testosterone, which women produce in low levels, has been linked to sex drive and energy levels. It declines from the 30s onwards, and small numbers of women need it topped up. So how do you know if you're going through it? It is possible to take a blood test to measure levels of a hormone called FSH (follicle-stimulating hormones) but it's not very accurate, particularly over the age of 45. Experts say hormone levels go up and down all the time, even during the course of a day, so the test can't really pin down what's going on. A better way is to talk to a GP or nurse about the pattern of your periods and any symptoms you are experiencing. Knowing what symptoms to look out for is important - feeling low and irritable needs to be recognised as much as hot flushes and night sweats. A change in periods - becoming more heavy or more irregular - is one of the first signs of the menopause approaching. Until you are period-free for a year, you won't know you've actually gone through the menopause. What then? Well, oestrogen levels in the body don't recover after the menopause. With rising life expectancy, women are now living more than a third of their lives with oestrogen deficiency. But there is no reason to be cowed, says Dr Heather Currie, gynaecologist, menopause expert and past chairwoman of the British Menopause Society. "Women are continuing to work later in life, they still look amazing - the image of the menopause is changing." Her advice: "If you're affected, go and visit your GP surgery armed with information. "Women should know what symptoms to look out for." She says there is plenty of support and information to help women cope with the physical and emotional changes which the menopause brings. Hormone replacement therapy is seen as the most effective treatment available for menopausal symptoms. There has been debate over its long-term safety, and it can cause some side-effects, but it has been shown that "the benefits of HRT outweigh the risks", Dr Currie says. Talking to other women going through the menopause and experiencing the same symptoms is also a real help, she adds. And the menopause is another good reason for women to lead a healthy lifestyle by: Doing these things will help to reduce the effects of the menopause on the body.
About 10,000 people have already been evacuated, with officials urging people to stay at least nine kilometres (5.6 miles) away from Mount Agung. Tremors have been reported, and there are indications that magma is rising to the surface, the officials say. More than 1,000 people died when Mount Agung last erupted in 1963. "There should be zero public activity within the specified radius in case there is an eruption," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency was quoted as saying by Reuters. One villager, I Wayan Suwarjana, told the AFP news agency: "Tremors happen very often, so we are afraid and I have taken all my family members to the refugee shelter." Early on Saturday, officials said that increased seismic activity was ongoing, hours after the alert level was raised. The latest report from Indonesia's volcano observatory for aviation said the likelihood of an eruption appears to be increasing. But it added that eruptions cannot be predicted with perfect accuracy. Bali's international airport in Denpasar, which is used by millions of foreign tourists each year, is currently operating as normal, the officials say. Australia's department of foreign affairs has issued an advisory for the region, warning travellers that a possible eruption could severely disrupt air travel. Predictions about the potential eruption are based on the one in 1963, which saw the volcano expel large amounts of debris and extensive lava flows. It also involved a pyroclastic flow - a dangerous fast-moving hot cloud of gas, ash and volcanic matter. Mount Agung, which is more than 3,000m above sea level, lies in the eastern part of Bali. It is among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia - an archipelago prone to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes as it sits on the Pacific "Ring of Fire".
The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) dipped to 50.3 in November from October's 50.8, closer to the 50 point mark that separates growth from contraction. It was below the 50.6 level expected by economists. Rising costs and falling demand were blamed for the downturn in activity. Meanwhile, a private survey from from HSBC showed that growth in Chinese factories in November stalled as output shrank for the first time in six months. The final HSBC/Markit manufacturing PMI slipped to a six-month low of 50 in November, down from 50.4 in October. The reading was unchanged from a preliminary "flash" finding released earlier this month. Output fell to 49.6, which was the worst reading since May. "Muted growth in new work," led companies to hold back production, HSBC/Markit said. Boost needed Growth in the world's second largest economy fell to 7.3% in the third quarter, which was the slowest pace since the global financial crisis. The risk that China might miss its official growth target of 7.5% this year for the first time in 15 years is growing because economic data is weaker than expected, economists said. A struggling property market, uneven export growth and cooling domestic demand and investment are some of the major factors weighing on overall growth. Alaistair Chan, economist at Moody's Analytics, said he had expected the slowdown in manufacturing and was a "little more pessimistic" than the market for two reasons. "Firstly, there are signs the recent export boom is fading. Meanwhile, the housing market and related sectors such as steel and cement manufacturing, remains in a slump," Mr Chan said. House prices fall China's house prices fell on a monthly basis for the seventh straight month in November, a survey showed on Sunday. The average price of a new home in its 100 major cities was down 0.38% from October, the independent China Index Academy said. Earlier this month, the country's central bank unexpectedly cut interest rates to 2.75% for first time since 2012 in an attempt to revive the economy. Mr Chan said Monday's data shows further evidence that fourth quarter growth will be about the same as the third quarter with growth "below China's potential" and the government's target. "Monetary policy may need further action, possibly with a reserve ratio cut or another interest rate cut, by year end," he said.
Many had no valid documents, whilst others did not want to apply for asylum in Germany but in other countries, notably in Scandinavia, police said. New Year's Eve attacks on women in Cologne, blamed on migrants, have put pressure on Chancellor Angela Merkel. Most of those sent back to Austria are not Syrians, who usually get asylum. Instead, they are migrants mostly from Afghanistan as well as Morocco and Algeria, Austrian police said. "The daily number of migrants being turned back has risen from 60 in December to 200 since the start of the year," David Furtner, police spokesman in Upper Austria state, told AFP news agency. Last week, Sweden, a favoured destination for many of the migrants, sought to stem the flow by imposing controls on travellers from Denmark. Earlier, an official report said the men suspected of attacking women in central Cologne on New Year's Eve were "almost exclusively" from a migration background, mainly North African and Arab. Nineteen individuals are currently under investigation by the state police in connection with the attacks, NRW's interior ministry says in a report (in German), none of them German nationals. Those 19 suspects include 14 men from Morocco and Algeria. Ten of the suspects are asylum seekers, nine of whom arrived in Germany after September 2015. The other nine are possibly in Germany illegally, the interior ministry says. Cologne police also made "serious mistakes" in not calling in reinforcements and the way they informed the public. The scale of the assaults on women in Cologne and other German cities has shocked Germany. More than 500 criminal complaints were filed, 40% alleging sexual assault. Apparent retaliatory attacks in Cologne on Sunday in which at least 11 people from Pakistan, Syria and Guinea were hurt were condemned by the government as inexcusable. Around 1.1 million asylum seekers arrived in Germany in 2015.
"Ultimately, it hurts the president to do that," Dr Fauci said in an interview with The Atlantic. "It doesn't do anything but reflect poorly on them." On Sunday, a White House official shared a list detailing past apparent erroneous comments by Dr Fauci. But on Wednesday Mr Trump insisted he had a "good relationship" with him. "We're all in the same team including Dr Fauci," he said. "We want to get rid of this mess that China sent us, so everybody's working on the same line and we're doing very well." The White House statement attacking Dr Fauci criticised him for what it said was conflicting advice on face coverings and remarks on Covid-19's severity. Responding to the criticism, Dr Fauci told The Atlantic that targeting him was "completely wrong". "I cannot figure out in my wildest dreams why they would want to do that," he said. "I think they realise now that that was not a prudent thing to do, because it's only reflecting negatively on them," he added. Anthony Fauci isn't angry. He's just... disappointed. The top government expert on infectious diseases took the high road in his first public comments after White House officials, both on and off the record, questioned his professional judgement and handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Fauci acknowledges that the advice and analysis he has provided has shifted over time, but he insists his recommendations have always been based on the latest science. Those views have sometimes led to clashes with the president, who has attempted to shift focus to rebuilding a US economy that has been devastated by the pandemic. Dr Fauci has said that the top priority must be controlling the spread of the virus and recent reopening steps have set those efforts back. Such blunt talk has helped make Dr Fauci a popular figure during the pandemic, and that alone may be behind some of the resentment that is simmering within the White House. The swipes at Dr Fauci, however, seem destined to be counter-productive. With a general election just a few months away the Trump campaign needs a consistent public message - and an administration attacking one of its own, then distancing itself from those attacks, may only promote a message of chaos and confusion. Dr Fauci was also criticised by Peter Navarro, Mr Trump's top trade adviser, in an opinion piece for USA Today in which he said the disease expert had been "wrong about everything I have interacted with him on". However, the White House distanced itself from Mr Navarro's remarks, with communications chief Alyssa Farah tweeting that the article "didn't go through normal White House clearance processes" and was "the opinion of Peter alone". Asked about Mr Navarro's piece as he departed the White House for Atlanta, Mr Trump said he should not have written it. "Well he made a statement representing himself. He shouldn't be doing that," he said. In his interview with The Atlantic, Dr Fauci said he was not thinking of resigning over the attacks on him. "I think the problem is too important for me to get into those kinds of thoughts and discussions. I just want to do my job. I'm really good at it. I think I can contribute. And I'm going to keep doing it," he said. He has also told Reuters that he believes the US will successfully develop a vaccine against the coronavirus by the end of the year. It follows early stage results from a vaccine developed by the firm Moderna, which Dr Fauci said were promising because the vaccine appeared to offer the type of protection seen in a natural infection. Dr Fauci's comments come after reports that as of 15 July, US hospitals will have to report Covid-19 patient data to the federal health agency in Washington instead of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC, the US's top public health institute, has until now been responsible for handling data about the pandemic from its hospital network. Health experts have expressed concerns that data will be politicised, become less transparent and possibly affect the work of researchers and modellers. The US has reported more than 3.4 million cases of coronavirus, and more than 136,000 deaths nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.
There have been a lot of changes to exams lately. Have there been any changes to GCSEs this year? The exam regulator, Ofqual, says there were few changes to GCSEs this summer compared with recent years. Last year, however, saw the return to linear GCSE exams, with all pupils sitting their tests in the summer at the end of the two-year course, rather than taking exams on the various parts of the qualification at several points during their courses. One change this year is that GCSE English literature and history syllabuses required teenagers to study the full curriculum - some previous syllabuses had allowed for a narrower range of content to be studied. Has there been any change in entry patterns? While there are relatively few changes to qualifications this summer, there are some changes in entry patterns at GCSE. Ofqual says the overall entry for GCSEs in England has decreased from 5,085,000 in 2014 to 4,916,000 this year. Early entries (for students in Year 10 or below) has fallen over the same period by 32%, from 504,000 to 344,000. This reflects a government move to discourage schools from entering pupils early for exams. The number of students entering GCSE English literature or English has fallen when compared to last year, while the number of students entering IGCSE English language has risen. Aren't GCSE grades changing soon? Yes, GCSEs will soon be graded from 9-1, rather than the current A*-G. Students starting GCSE courses this September in maths, English and English literature will get the new grades when they receive their results in the summer of 2017. The new grades will come in for most other common GCSEs the following year. This will apply to subjects such as biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, languages, religious education, geography, music and history, which will be taught from September 2016, with exams taken in the summer of 2018. There will be a third wave of 9-1 graded GCSEs sat in summer 2019 for courses taught from September 2017. These include subjects such as psychology, ancient history, business, information and communications technology (ICT) and media studies. What should I do if I am getting my GCSE results on Thursday? You may get your results by text, email or in the post, but it's still a good idea to go to your school or college on results day. By doing this, you can get help and advice from your teachers. Do I have to stay on at school or college? If you live in England, yes. This summer's GCSE cohort in England (born between 1 September 1998 and 31 August 1999) is the second to have to stay on in education or employment with training until the age of 18. The Department for Education raised the participation age in England in two stages. The first stage meant pupils who left Year 11 in the summer of 2013 had to continue in education or training for at least another year until June 2014. The second phase saw pupils who left Year 11 in summer 2014 or later have to continue until at least their 18th birthday. However, if you live in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, it is a different picture. In Scotland, if you turn 16 between 1 March and 30 September, you can leave school after 31 May of that year. If you turn 16 between 1 October and the end of February, you can leave at the start of the Christmas holidays in that school year. In Wales, you can leave school on the last Friday in June, as long as you will be 16 by the end of that school year's summer holidays. In Northern Ireland, if you turn 16 during the school year (between 1 September and 1 July), you can leave school after 30 June. If you turn 16 between 2 July and 31 August, you cannot leave school until 30 June the following year. What can I do if I don't have the grades needed for A-level or vocational courses? Try not to panic. If you don't get the grades asked for by the sixth-form or college of your choice, approach the staff there and see if they are prepared to be flexible. It's possible they will still give you a place or they might be prepared to take you on for different courses. Alternatively, approach other schools or colleges - you might find they will accept you. Can I resit? Students will be able to resit GCSEs in maths and English in November. Ofqual says there is an expectation that anyone sitting the examinations offered in November will be aged 16. The regulator says resits will not be available in November for any other subjects. Can I challenge my results? If you feel strongly that your grades are wrong and do not reflect your ability, you can ask for a re-mark of your papers. Requests for re-marking can only be done through your school or college. Make sure someone there is dealing with the matter. There is a fee for this service, which is reimbursed only if there is a grade change. The Joint Council for Qualifications has guidelines on the post-results service available to schools. Where can I go for more advice? You can call the national Exam Results Helpline on 0808 100 8000 or speak to an adviser from the National Careers Service on 0800 100 900. The government website Gov.UK might also help you make decisions.
In both the photos, taken by his mother the Duchess of Cambridge, the future king flashes a gap-toothed smile at the camera. She photographed her son earlier this month and the pictures are likely to have been taken at their Norfolk home. Kensington Palace said Prince William and Catherine were "delighted" to share the photos. In one of the pictures, George is dressed in a dark green polo shirt and in the other he stands side-on, dressed more casually in a T-shirt with a camouflage design. The prince is the great-grandchild of the Queen. He will be the 43rd monarch since William the Conqueror obtained the crown of England in 1066 if, as is expected, he follows on as king from his grandfather, the Prince of Wales, and then his father, the Duke of Cambridge. Prince George was pictured several times during the coronavirus lockdown with his younger siblings, five-year-old Princess Charlotte and two-year-old Prince Louis, as they applauded heath and care workers during the weekly Clap for Carers. Prince George Alexander Louis - known as His Royal Highness Prince George of Cambridge - was born on 22 July 2013. He was born in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in central London and appeared in front of the world's media one day later, when Prince William and Catherine stood cradling him on the hospital steps. Earlier this year, the duke and duchess spoke about home-schooling George and his brother and sister while schools closed to most pupils during lockdown. "The children have got such stamina I don't know how," Catherine told the BBC. "You pitch a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake. You get to the end of the day and they have had a lovely time - but it is amazing how much you can cram into one day, that's for sure."
By Sean CoughlanBBC News education correspondent From 2015, GCSEs will move from coursework to exams at the end of two years and will be graded from 8 to 1, rather than A* to G. "We need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence," Mr Gove told the House of Commons. Labour's Stephen Twigg attacked "shallow" changes lacking in evidence. Mr Twigg accused Mr Gove of "cutting back on re-sits, while affording himself a fourth attempt at GCSE reform". Mary Bousted, leader of the ATL teachers' union, said the constant change in exams was turning pupils into "Mr Gove's guinea pigs". 'Merit' Head teachers' leader Russell Hobby said the plans for a "more rigorous exam to the existing GCSE contain merit" but warned against an over-hasty implementation. "We need to take time to get any new assessment system right." Wales and Northern Ireland are keeping GCSEs, but so far are not adopting the changes proposed for England. Ofqual head Glenys Stacey says: "We want to see qualifications that are more stretching for the most able students, using assessments that really test knowledge, understanding and skills." There is no sign of a change in name to I-level for the English exams - as had been rumoured. Key changes from autumn 2015 The reforms will initially apply to a group of core subjects - English language and literature, maths, physics, chemistry, biology, combined science, history and geography. 'Whole book' Hundreds of thousands of pupils will begin studying these revised GCSEs from autumn 2015 and the first candidates to take the exams will be in summer 2017. Apart from exceptions such as practical experiments in science, there will be a shift towards results depending fully on exams taken at the end of two years. It will mean removing the 25% of marks in history, English literature and geography that are currently allowed for controlled assessments. Grading will be by numbers rather than letters - with 8 at the top and 1 at the bottom. The pass mark will be pushed higher, with claims it will compare with the highest-performing school systems, such as Finland and Shanghai. But the National Union of Teachers said Finland used a high level of the type of student assessment being removed from exams in England. The new GCSEs will push for a more stretching, essay-based exam system, reminiscent of O-levels, taken by pupils until the late 1980s. Mr Gove told MPs that previous course specifications "were too vague" and had caused "suspicion and speculation that some exam boards were 'harder' than others". History will require more study of British history. Pupils will have to write an in-depth study of a 25-to-50-year period within a range of eras stretching from 500AD to the present day. There will be a less prominent world history section and pupils will be asked to study a theme such as changes in politics, religion or culture across the medieval, early modern and modern eras. In English literature, exam questions will be designed to ensure that pupils have read the whole book. The course content will include at least one play by Shakespeare, a selection of work by the Romantic poets, a 19th Century novel, a selection of poetry since 1850 and a 20th Century novel or drama. For both English language and literature, digital texts are excluded. Maths will promote the idea of developing independent problem-solving skills, rather than setting types of questions that can be rehearsed. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said: "We do need to start competing against those top performing countries in the world, because for too long we've pretended that students' results are getting better, when all that's been happening is the exams have been getting easier." Brian Lightman, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said his greatest concern was about the proposed syllabus changes. "Simply making exams harder does not guarantee higher standards or mean that students will be prepared for a job. The curriculum should stretch and challenge the highest achieving students but it must also engage and motivate those who struggle at the other end." 'Rushed' This is the latest stage in Mr Gove's drive to reconfigure the exam system. Last year, Mr Gove announced plans for the scrapping of GCSEs and their replacement with English Baccalaureate Certificates, with each subject to be set by a single exam board. This re-branding was scrapped, with GCSEs to be retained but reformed instead. NUT general secretary Christine Blower said the the government's approach was "rushed". "If you did this by consensus, by actually talking to the profession and understanding how best to examine things, we would be in a much better position." Chris Keates, leader of the Nasuwt teachers' union, attacked the government's claim that the GCSE was a "broken qualification" and said it had "proved itself to be a robust and reliable qualification". She accused the government of driving an "inaccurate and ideologically-driven media attack on the qualification". The latest plans will be put out to consultation over the summer, with a timetable that will see exam boards producing courses to be accredited by Ofqual for teaching in autumn 2015. The prospect of different forms of GCSEs in England, and Wales and Northern Ireland has raised the question of how they will be distinguished from each other. The CBI said employers would want to be "crystal clear about the differences to eliminate any confusion".
Filmed by US troops in China, the clip was found by government-funded researchers at Seoul National University in US archives. The 18-second clip shows several women lined up talking to a Chinese soldier. South Korean activists estimate 200,000 women were forced into brothels for Japan's military. They are believed to have been mainly from Korea, but also from China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Taiwan. Some of the women were willing, others were lured with the offer of paid work as cooks or cleaners and many were forced, a UN report said. Until now, the only records of women forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese military during World War Two had been photographs and survivor testimonials. The research team says the footage was filmed by joint US-Chinese troops in China's Yunnan province which was previously occupied by Japan. The seven Korean women were freed in 1944 and the officer speaking with them has been identified as a Chinese captain of the China-US Combined Force, the team said. The issue has long strained the relationship between South Korea and Japan over a perceived lack of adequate apology and compensation from Japan. In 2015, the two countries reached a settlement whereby Tokyo formally apologised and agreed to pay 1bn yen ($8.3m, £5.6m) to fund victims. Many Koreans though viewed the apology as insufficient and the issue continues to plague ties. In January, Japan temporarily withdrew its ambassador to South Korea over a "comfort women" statue placed outside the Japanese consulate in Busan. A similar statue has also been placed outside Japan's consulate in Seoul, and Tokyo wants both these statues to be removed. Correction 31 July 2017: This article has been amended to make it clear that not all the "comfort women" were coerced.
Uber CEO Travis Kalanick made the admission while speaking at a private event in Vancouver, according to Canadian tech news site Betakit. The $1bn figure was later confirmed with Uber China by Reuters news agency. US-based Uber launched in China in 2014 and competes against the country's largest taxi app Didi Kuaidi. Uber is available in more than 40 cities in China. It announced last year that it would expand into 100 Chinese cities over the next 12 months. 'Buying market share' "We're profitable in the USA, but we're losing over $1bn a year in China," Betakit quoted Mr Kalanick as saying. He described China as the firm's largest international marketplace. But Uber's market share is dwarfed by that of the larger Didi Kuaidi. "We have a fierce competitor that's unprofitable in every city they exist in, but they're buying up market share." Mr Kalanick has previously said the firm had gone from a tiny 1% share of China's market at the beginning of 2015 to about 30% to 35%. Didi Kuaidi, which is backed by Chinese tech giants Tencent and Alibaba, has now also partnered with Uber's rival US ride-sharing service Lyft. Mr Kalanick said he had recently raised about $200m to help the firm compete in emerging markets, Betakit said. "I wish the world wasn't that way. I prefer building rather than fundraising. But if I don't participate in the fundraising bonanza, I'll get squeezed out by others buying market share," he added. Uber is available in 380 cities around the world, according to the website.
She also said there were "favourable" prospects for more improvements in the jobs market and the economy as whole. Her comments came in a written testimony for the US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. But Ms Yellen warned that continued turbulence in Greece and China posed risks to US growth. Stock markets were little changed after her announcement, with the Dow Jones index up 0.09% and the S&P 500 up 0.16% at midday. "It was basically an extension of her speech on Friday," said Tom Porcelli, chief US economist at RBC Capital Markets, referring to Ms Yellen's remarks in Cleveland. IMF warning In the written testimony, Ms Yellen said: "If the economy evolves as we expect, economic conditions likely would make it appropriate at some point this year to raise the federal funds rate target, thereby beginning to normalise the stance of monetary policy." A rise in interest rates would be the first increase since 2006. Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned the US against raising interest rates this year. The IMF advised keeping rates at the current level of between 0% and 0.25% "into the first half of 2016 with a gradual rise in the federal funds rate thereafter". Jobs Ms Yellen admitted that labour markets still showed some "slack", suggesting that monetary policy should remain "accommodative", that is, interest rates should stay low. She said: "Too many people are not searching for a job but would likely do so if the labour market was stronger. "And, although there are tentative signs that wage growth has picked up, it continues to be relatively subdued, consistent with other indications of slack." She said that a number of international problems could hold back growth including the Greek crisis. In addition, China "continues to grapple with the challenges posed by high debt, weak property markets, and volatile financial conditions". On the other hand, she added: "Economic growth abroad could pick up more quickly than observers generally anticipate, providing additional support for US activity." Her comments came as new official figures were released showing that US producer prices rose more than expected in June and that industrial production has strengthened. "Today's data support the Fed chair's message that the economy can support a rate hike," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors.
By Reality Check team and BBC MonitoringBBC News Leeds General Infirmary has apologised to the family of Jack, four, who was pictured sleeping on the floor of the hospital after being admitted with suspected pneumonia. The hospital's chief medical officer, Dr Yvette Oade, said she was "extremely sorry" that no bed was available because the unit was experiencing "exceptionally high levels of demand". But despite this statement, numerous posts have been spreading on social media claiming the photo was staged. So where did these claims come from? The photo, which was printed on the front page of the Yorkshire Evening Post and the Daily Mirror, was taken by Jack's mother. She said he'd been seen as soon as he arrived and given a bed and oxygen, but a few hours later the bed had to be given to another patient and Jack was left without one for more than four hours. His mother said she then made a makeshift bed for her son with coats and took the picture. On Monday, an ITV journalist tried to show Boris Johnson the photo on his phone but the prime minister initially refused to look at it. The footage has been viewed millions of times on Twitter alone. What we know about the posts Within hours of the exchange with the prime minister, this post emerged on Facebook claiming that, according to "a good friend" who is a senior nursing sister at Leeds Hospital, the mother staged the photo to send to the media and that, in fact, the boy did have a hospital trolley. It was first posted on Facebook we think at about 18:30 GMT on 9 December. This post, shared at least 20,000 times, has since been deleted. BBC Newsnight has spoken to the owner of this account who said that they do not, in fact, have a good friend who is a senior nursing sister at Leeds hospital. The woman, in her 50s, who does not want to be named, said she'd accepted a friend request from someone claiming to be an old school friend on Monday afternoon. Despite not recognising them, she accepted and then looked at her new friend's Facebook page. She saw the post about the hospital and copied and pasted it into her own account. She said the way it suddenly went viral made her suspect she'd been the victim of a co-ordinated ploy. She's now taken down her social media accounts. Posts with identical wording to the original Facebook post emerged on Twitter within a few hours on Monday evening. The posts gained wider traction after they were shared by accounts including Daily Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson and the Conservative politician Michael Fabricant. Facebook later said the "I know a nurse..." claim had been rated as false by fact-checking organisation Full Fact and would be flagged as such to readers. "So if it's still being shared it will now appear much lower in people's news feeds with a grey overlay screen saying 'false information' linking to Full Fact's post." A different post suggested that the object next to the boy was a bed and so the photo was staged. But the hospital in its apology to Jack's family had said there was no bed there: "We are extremely sorry that there were only chairs available in the treatment room, and no bed." This claim was first posted on Facebook in a pro-Brexit group and shared by similar accounts. It then made its way on to Twitter as well. The third post claims to be from a former paediatric nurse who questions the photo based on the type of oxygen mask the boy was using. It was shared by a number of Twitter accounts including one called PickleBertie and their post, according to the archived version of the tweet, which has now been deleted, was retweeted 529 times and liked 739 times. PickleBertie's account has now been deleted, but an archived version of their Twitter page from early December reveals a high level of anonymity (a generic picture of a dog with a UK flag and no personal details such as a name or link to other social media pages).

President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said the suspension included operations to stop people-smuggling, joint military exercises and intelligence exchange. The move came after Jakarta recalled its ambassador from Canberra on Monday. Reports of the spying allegations came out in Australian media from documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden. The leaked document showed that Australian spy agencies named Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the first lady, the vice-president and other senior ministers as targets for telephone monitoring, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Guardian said. The alleged spying took place in 2009, under the previous government. Australia and Indonesia are key allies and trading partners. "It is not possible that we can continue our co-operation when we are still uncertain that there is no spying towards us," Mr Yudhoyono said. He added he would also write to Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott to seek an official explanation over spying allegations. The decision came after Mr Yudhoyono met with top officials, including the recalled Indonesian ambassador to Australia, to discuss the country's relationship with one of its closest neighbours, reports say. "We're not only reviewing our co-operation with Australia, we're actually already implementing the downgrading of our bilateral relations with Australia," Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa also said on Wednesday. He added that Australia "must take concrete steps" to "repair the almost irreparable damage ". He added that the relationship between both countries was "not business as usual". Strained relations Mr Yudhoyono said on Tuesday that ties with Australia had been "damaged" over what he said was "hurtful action". Mr Abbot reiterated on Wednesday he regretted the embarrassment the media reports have caused. However, he has also previously said he does not believe Australia "should be expected to apologise for reasonable intelligence-gathering operations". The document based on a presentation from the Defence Signals Directorate - now known as the Australian Signals Directorate - showed that agencies attempted to listen to Mr Yudhoyono's calls at least once. They also tracked calls made to and from his mobile phone in August 2009. The row is the latest in a series of spying allegations that have strained relations between the two allies, whose relationship include co-operation on asylum-seekers and anti-terrorism, among issues. Earlier this month, Indonesia also expressed anger over reports that Australia's Jakarta embassy was used as part of a US-led spying network in Asia.
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) thinks the second quarter, starting in April, will see GDP exceed the level seen at the start of 2008. In upgraded forecasts, it estimates economic growth will be 2.8% this year - up from its earlier estimate of 2.7%. But it also warns of an "unacceptably high" level of youth unemployment. 'Sunny predictions' "Our economic recovery is gaining momentum," said BCC director general John Longworth. "Businesses across the UK are expanding and creating jobs, and our increasingly sunny predictions for growth are a testament to their drive and ambition." In December, the BCC forecast economic growth would reach pre-recession levels by the autumn. It has also upgraded its growth forecast for 2015, from 2.4% to 2.5%. These more optimistic forecasts, the BCC says, are mainly due to upward revisions to historic GDP data by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The group also predicts the first increase in UK interest rates will come at the end of 2015, rising from their historic low of 0.5% to 0.75%. 'Major issues' It expects further modest increases will see the rate rise to 1.5% by the second half of 2016. But Mr Longworth warned it was not "time to break out the champagne glasses just yet". He added: "Major issues remain, such as the unacceptably high level of youth unemployment. "We urge the chancellor to use this month's Budget wisely by incentivising businesses to hire young people so that the next generation of workers are not left behind." He also called for more business investment and better access to finance for companies. The BCC forecasts are echoed in a separate report, from accountants BDO. It says strong growth is being helped by increased optimism and improved hiring intentions, particularly in manufacturing. Budget backdrop Like the BCC report, BDO's analysis predicts wages will grow above the level of inflation from the middle of this year. Separately, in a report on business confidence, the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said one in seven smaller companies wanted to create jobs in the next three months. The FSB also said a growing number of companies were getting access to finance. The upbeat reports follow encouraging economic data in recent months, and provide a positive backdrop to Chancellor George Osborne's Budget announcement on 19 March. He is expected to announce an upgrade to UK growth forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In December's Autumn Statement, the OBR forecast growth of 2.4% for 2014.
The plan marks a climbdown from ministers who had decided they should not get the same UK resettlement rights as interpreters in the Iraq conflict. A five-year visa will be offered initially to those who worked on the front line for a year or more - covering around half of interpreters. But there were concerns that a large number of them could be excluded. A Downing Street source said the proposals would give interpreters a choice either to go on working in Afghanistan or "make a new start in Britain". While details of the scheme are not expected until the end of May, lawyers said "large numbers" of interpreters might be not be covered. Rosa Curling, who acts for three of the interpreters, said she was pleased the "bravery of the Afghan interpreters now seems to have been recognised. "We are, however, concerned that some interpreters may not qualify if the scheme is only available to those employed between December 2012 and December 2014 and limited to front-line staff only, she added. "This would completely undermine the purpose of the policy." Too limited One interpreter, "Abdul", told the BBC: "We risked everything to do this job. We are glad that the British government has recognised our service and the sacrifices we made for them." The Downing Street source said: "We should recognise the service given by those who have regularly put themselves in real danger while working for us," the source added. But campaign group Avaaz, which is behind an 83,000 signature petition calling for all Afghan interpreters to be given asylum, said the plan was "too limited". It claimed to have seen documents suggesting the scheme would only be open to those who had been made redundant on or after 1 January 2013, although Downing Street said it was more likely decisions would be made on a "case-by-case basis". The Ministry of Defence said no final decisions had yet been made. Earlier this month, the prime minister had said the UK should encourage "talented Afghans to stay in their country", including a "really generous" package of support for interpreters. Labour's Yvette Cooper welcomed what she called the government's "u-turn", saying it was the "right policy" for those who risked their lives. Training and education Many of the interpreters who will be helped say they have received serious threats to their lives, while some have already fled to the UK to claim asylum. "One of my colleagues was captured, held for months and killed by the Taliban. They returned his body to his family in exchange for ransom," one former interpreter told the BBC. "Ahmad" - who worked alongside British forces at Camp Bastion - said he had grenades thrown at his house and had to leave the job because the Taliban threatened to kill him. Under the plans, those allowed into the UK on a five-year visa will then be able to apply for indefinite leave. The Border Agency will approve how many close family members they are allowed to bring. Interpreters who choose to stay in Afghanistan will be allowed to sign up for fully-funded training and education for five years, or instead be paid at their current rate for a further 18 months. Under the new plan, some other locals who had helped British soldiers in non-front-line roles, such as cooks and security guards, will also be given the choice of training and education, or further payments. After the Iraq war, Britain gave Iraqi interpreters either one-off financial assistance or exceptional indefinite leave to remain in the UK with help to relocate, or the opportunity to resettle through the UK's Gateway programme run in partnership with the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees.
By Jessica SherwoodBBC News But for some women, Halloween is not just a once-a-year holiday reserved for children. It's a job. Ellie, 21, is a professional body painter and social media star from Edinburgh, who has made a career out of Halloween. "It's one of my favourite times of the year," she says. "Halloween gets mad in the makeup world." Ellie found fame as a beauty influencer on Instagram, where she creates spellbinding looks which blur the line between beauty and horror. Ellie's account had humble beginnings and was originally used to post her Halloween looks before she began painting them all year round. "I have always been artistic. I studied art and performance at school, and one Halloween I put it all into practice. "Everyone was going to the Halloween disco as pretty things and I arrived as a horrible creepy clown. That was it really, everyone thought it was quite cool." As well as working with brands on Instagram, Ellie also works as a freelance body painter - going to houses and events to turn people into various horror creations. Ellie says she is often approached by people to produce an array of looks they have seen online or in film, but that ultimately people enjoy their own take on characters. "The cinema is always a good source of inspiration for people," she says. "Pennywise from It and Maleficent are very popular this year. "You do get different ones though. The other day I got asked to do a pretty version of Shrek." She says there is a spike in British interest in Halloween due to American influencers online. "People want more from Halloween because of how they see it online," she says. "People see it as a chance to be daring and to transform yourself. "Makeup is evolving so much. Everyone is going bigger and wilder and having more fun with Halloween, and that is partly because of what they see online." Perhaps unsurprisingly, Ellie finds Halloween is her busiest time as a body painter in terms of brand deals and her work. "With my style a lot of companies only notice me at Halloween," she says. "Which is fine. It's what I love to do and I'm grateful." You may also like: "Often the first port of call for beauty inspiration is social media" says Holly Stewart, head of brand for online cosmetics retailer Beauty Bay. "We know that our customers spend hours researching on channels such as Instagram and love to seek inspiration this way. She notes that in recent years there has been more of a demand for products specifically dedicated to Halloween, to help users achieve the looks they have been seeing online. "Makeup application is now a pivotal part of creating a Halloween look. Beauty Bay now [offers] specific Halloween ranges from our retailed brands, this can be bundles of looks, for example, a five-minute cat look or single products." Influencers can make money from sponsorship and endorsements from companies selling beauty products. But the most lucrative strategy is to launch and sell their own product lines. For example, the American YouTube star and body painter Lex Fleming, 26 from Chicago, regularly works with cosmetics brands during the Halloween period and is known for her conceptual and intricate looks. "The 'Pumpkin King' is my first look that really took off," she says. "It was based on my interpretation of Jack Skellington from the Nightmare Before Christmas. "I see it all over the internet in various styles and colours now." Lex began her YouTube channel seven years ago to showcase her talent and connect with others. She now has 2.7 million subscribers. "I know what it's like to be the odd kid," she says. "YouTube showed me that you are never truly alone. "To my absolute shock, I've grown an online family that all share my weird and creative soul." As well as collaborating and endorsing brands, Lex runs her own business selling makeup brushes which she markets as "perfect for beauty or monsters". "After gaining an incredible amount of supporters from around the world, I took steps to pursue my dream of my own cosmetic line and cosmetic brushes," she writes on her website. "My main goal is to provide the best quality of products to give others the confidence to express themselves on a living, breathing, canvas." Lex discovered her love of body painting when she was 14 when she began experimenting with eye-shadow to create looks she used as a form of escapism. "Bullying was rough for me in high school," she says. "I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. "I would come home from school and turn myself into different characters and imagine how they might handle this kind of stress in life. "I may not be a superhero, but I like to believe I can paint a pretty good one." Despite her large following, she urges others to embrace their own individuality and not pay too much attention to what's popular online. "When I first started on YouTube, many people were open to different and original ideas," she says. "It seems to be more of a trend to look like one individual online, than it is to embrace your individuality. "I would love to see a swing of things in the future where people become inspired to be themselves, instead of wanting to change into someone else."
Greeks will be asked to accept or reject proposals made by creditors last week, with Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras urging a "No" vote. Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis accused the creditors of blackmail. But he pledged a deal would be reached soon after the vote and that current limits on bank withdrawals would ease. Greek banks did not open this week after the European Central Bank froze their liquidity lifeline. Withdrawals from cash machines are capped at just €60 (£43; $66) a day but some bank branches have reopened to allow pensioners - many of whom do not use bank cards - a one-off weekly withdrawal of up to €120. Long queues formed outside banks for a second day on Thursday morning. Follow the latest updates Local media are reporting growing pressure on the economy, with businesses halting production because they are unable to pay suppliers, and some shops considering giving unpaid leave to staff. Greece's left-wing Syriza government, elected on an anti-austerity platform, has been in deadlock with its creditors for months over the terms of a third bailout. With the previous eurozone bailout expired, Greece no longer has access to billions of euros in funds. Athens missed the deadline for a €1.5bn (£1.1bn; $1.7bn) repayment to the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday. Last weekend, the Greek government took the unilateral decision to hold a vote. EU leaders have warned that a "No" vote may see Greece leave the eurozone - though Mr Tsipras says he does not want this to happen. A poll cited by euro2day.gr said 47% of people were leaning toward a "Yes" vote, with the "No" camp at 43%. A previous poll suggested the "No" camp had a shrinking lead. Adler: Politics trumps economics Peston: Greece bossed by ECB Greek press splits over referendum On Wednesday Mr Tsipras put new proposals to eurozone partners, accepting most of what was on the table before talks with creditors collapsed last week, but with conditions. His latest offer is tied explicitly to agreement on a request for a third bailout from the eurozone's bailout fund lasting two years and amounting to €29.1bn. However, later Mr Tsipras made a defiant speech on national TV confirming Sunday's vote would go ahead and urging a "No" vote to strengthen Greece's hand in negotiations. Mr Varoufakis said later in a TV interview: "This is a very dark moment for Europe. They have closed our banks for the sole purpose of blackmailing what? Getting a 'Yes' vote on a non-sustainable solution that would be bad for Europe." But he added: "On Monday, the creditors, the lenders will have taken the message by the Greek people... So as soon as they get this message, be sure that in a very short time there will be a response." Dutch Finance Minister and Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem replied to Mr Tsipras's proposals by saying a new bailout could only be discussed "after and on the basis of the outcome of" the vote. The BBC's James Reynolds in Athens says EU negotiators believe the proposals themselves have now expired and that there is little point in taking the country's phone calls until the referendum is held. IMF chief Christine Lagarde appeared to hint at frustration with the the Greek government. "We have received so many 'latest' offers, which themselves have been validated, invalidated, changed, amended, over the course of the last few days, that it's quite uncertain exactly where the latest proposal stands," she told Reuters. The European Commission - one of the "troika" of creditors along with the IMF and the ECB - wants Athens to raise taxes and cut welfare spending to meet its debt obligations. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was among those insisting talks must follow the outcome of the vote. Lenders' proposals - key sticking points Source: European Commission document, 26 Jun 15 (pdf) Greek debt jargon explained Tsipras and his Greek gamble However, French President Francois Hollande said he wanted a deal to be found before the referendum. "We have to be clear. An accord is for right now, it will not be put off," he said. Human rights body the Council of Europe has said the referendum would "fall short of international standards" if held as planned on Sunday, citing the short notice given to voters and the lack of clarity in the question to be put to voters.
By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent The study, based on 40 years of data on a range of measures, says governments are failing to address the crisis. Without deep and lasting changes, the world is facing "untold human suffering" the study says. The researchers say they have a moral obligation to warn of the scale of the threat. Released on the day that satellite data shows that last month was the warmest October on record, the new study says that simply measuring global surface temperatures is an inadequate way of capturing the real dangers of an overheating world. So the authors include a range of data which they believe represents a "suite of graphical vital signs of climate change over the past 40 years". These indicators include the growth of human and animal populations, per capita meat production, global tree cover loss, as well as fossil fuel consumption. Some progress has been seen in some areas. For example, renewable energy has grown significantly, with consumption of wind and solar increasing 373% per decade - but it was still 28 times smaller than fossil fuel use in 2018. Taken together, the researchers say most of their vital signs indicators are going in the wrong direction and add up to a climate emergency. "An emergency means that if we do not act or respond to the impacts of climate change by reducing our carbon emissions, reducing our livestock production, reducing our land clearing and fossil fuel consumption, the impacts will likely be more severe than we've experienced to date," said lead author Dr Thomas Newsome, from the University of Sydney. "That could mean there are areas on Earth that are not inhabitable by people." How does this differ from other reports on climate change? The study echoes many of the warnings that have been reported by scientists including the IPCC. The authors set out to present a clear and simple graphical picture of a broader ranger of indicators that can drive home to the public and to governments that the threat is serious while the response has been poor. Where it differs is in showing that while things might be bad, they are not hopeless. The researchers show six areas in which immediate steps should be taken that could make a major difference. These are: Energy: Politicians should impose carbon fees high enough to discourage the use of fossil fuels, they should end subsidies to fossil fuel companies and implement massive conservation practices while also replacing oil and gas with renewables. Short-lived pollutants: These include methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot - the researchers say that limiting these has the potential to cut the short-term warming trend by 50% over the next few decades. Nature: Stop land clearing, restore forests, grasslands and mangroves which would all help to sequester CO2. Food: A big dietary shift is needed say researchers so that people eat mostly plants and consumer fewer animal products. Reducing food waste is also seen as critical. Economy: Convert the economy's reliance on carbon fuels - and change away from growing the world's gross domestic product and pursuing affluence. Population: The world needs to stabilise the global population which is growing by around 200,000 a day. So who are the scientists who have endorsed the report? Some 11,000 researchers of all types and varieties from 153 countries have endorsed the research The authors say they didn't target individuals so there is a marked lack of some of the bigger names in climate change research. All the details of who's signed the endorsement have been published online. "We have rising emissions, rising temperatures, and we've known this for 40 years and we haven't acted - you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know we have a a problem," said Dr Newsome. What do the authors want to happen now? The researchers are fed up because multiple climate conferences and assemblies have failed to produce meaningful action. However they believe that the growing, global protest movement offers hope. "We are encouraged by a recent global surge of concern - governments adopting new policies; schoolchildren striking; lawsuits proceeding; and grassroots citizen movements demanding change. "As scientists, we urge widespread use of the vital signs and hope the graphical indicators will better allow policymakers and the public to understand the magnitude of the crisis, realign priorities and track progress." So what about human population growth? The idea of trying to influence human population growth is highly controversial and has been deemed too hot to handle by UN negotiators. The authors say that looking the other way is no longer an option. "It is certainly a controversial topic - but I think that population should be talked about when considering human impacts on the Earth," said Dr Newsome. "It's important when presenting these results to look at some positives, and one of the more positive things that we've pulled out of this data is that there is now a slight decline in birth rates at a global level."

Dave LeeNorth America technology reporter The employees are demanding several key changes in how sexual misconduct allegations are dealt with at the firm, including a call to end forced arbitration - a move which would make it possible for victims to sue. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai has told staff he supports their right to take the action. "I understand the anger and disappointment that many of you feel," he said in an all-staff email. "I feel it as well, and I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society… and, yes, here at Google, too." A Twitter feed titled @googlewalkout documented the movement at Google's international offices. Google staff in Singapore, Zurich, London, Tokyo, Berlin and New York were among those to take part. Web developer Sam Dutton, who joined the walkout in London, told the BBC: "We're walking out to support colleagues in any workplace that have suffered harassment and to ensure that perpetrators aren't protected or rewarded." What led to the walkout? Anger has boiled over in the past week since the New York Times alleged that one high-profile executive received a $90m (£69m) payout after he left the firm, despite what Google considered a “credible” allegation of sexual misconduct. Andy Rubin, known as the “creator” of the Android mobile operating system, denies the accusation. On Tuesday, another executive - this time from the company’s X research lab - also resigned. Richard DeVaul was said to have made unwanted advances towards a woman who was recently interviewed for a job in which she would have reported to him. Mr DeVaul has not commented since his resignation, but has in the past called the incident an "error of judgement". At least 48 other employees were sacked for sexual harassment without receiving a payout, Mr Pichai told staff. He admitted the New York Times’ report had been "difficult to read". What do the employees want? Staff involved in Thursday's walkout left notes on their desks telling colleagues: "I’m not at my desk because I’m walking out with other Googlers and contractors to protest sexual harassment, misconduct, lack of transparency, and a workplace culture that’s not working for everyone." They have also made formal demands to Google’s management. They are: What is forced arbitration? Forced arbitration, a common contract clause for Silicon Valley workers, demands any disputes are dealt with internally rather than through other methods such as the courts. Critics of forced arbitration say it is used to not only protect the reputations of both the company and the accused, but also to silence victims who are unable to appeal against decisions or take further action. "Employees have raised constructive ideas for how we can improve our policies and our processes going forward,” said Mr Pichai in a statement on Wednesday evening. "We are taking in all their feedback so we can turn these ideas into action." What else are Google employees angry about? Co-ordinated action of this scale is unprecedented at a Silicon Valley company, but follows a trend for increasingly impassioned employee activism. "Women are fed up, and I don't think it's just women,” said Prof Kellie McElhaney, from the Haas School of Business. "There are a lot of ‘manbassadors' out there who are equally as fed up and using their positions of power and voice, which can cost Google money. I think you have to hit these companies where it hurts. "I think it empowers other Google offices when women and men are watching this happen, that they can do a similar action that's not just sitting by or making comments to one another or sharing emails." In the past year, Google employees have spoken out strongly against the company’s work with the US Department of Defense, as well as plans to re-enter the Chinese market with a search product. The Tech Workers Coalition, a San Francisco-based advocacy group, said the dispute over the treatment of women was just one of several that tech companies need to address. “We stand in solidarity with the Google workers,” a spokesperson for the group said. “It’s clear the executives won’t do this for us so we’re taking matters into our own hands."
By Richard BiltonBBC Panorama Eleven million documents were leaked from one of the world's most secretive companies, Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. They show how Mossack Fonseca has helped clients launder money, dodge sanctions and avoid tax. The company says it has operated beyond reproach for 40 years and has never been charged with criminal wrong-doing. French President Francois Hollande hailed the "good revelations" which would "increase tax revenues from those who commit fraud". The documents show 12 current or former heads of state and at least 60 people linked to current or former world leaders in the data. They include the Icelandic Prime Minister, Sigmundur David Gunnlaugson, who had an undeclared interest linked to his wife's wealth. He has said he will not resign. The files also reveal a suspected billion-dollar money laundering ring involving close associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Gerard Ryle, director of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), said the documents covered day-to-day business at Mossack Fonseca over the past 40 years. "I think the leak will prove to be probably the biggest blow the offshore world has ever taken because of the extent of the documents," he added. Panama Papers - tax havens of the rich and powerful exposed The documents also shed light on how Mossack Fonseca offered financial services designed to help business clients hide their wealth. One wealthy client, US millionaire and life coach Marianna Olszewski, was offered fake ownership records to hide money from the authorities. This is in direct breach of international regulations designed to stop money-laundering and tax evasion. An email from a Mossack executive to Ms Olszewski in January 2009 explains how she could deceive the bank: "We may use a natural person who will act as the beneficial owner… and therefore his name will be disclosed to the bank. Since this is a very sensitive matter, fees are quite high." Ms Olszewski did not respond to the BBC's questions. In a statement, Mossack Fonseca said: "Your allegations that we provide structures supposedly designed to hide the identity of the real owners, are completely unsupported and false. "We do not provide beneficiary services to deceive banks. It is difficult, not to say impossible, not to provide banks with the identity of final beneficiaries and the origin of funds." The data also contain secret offshore companies linked to the families and associates of Egypt's former President, Hosni Mubarak, former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. Russian connection Also revealed is a suspected billion-dollar money-laundering ring that was run by a Russian bank and involved close associates of President Putin. The operation was run by Bank Rossiya, which is subject to US and EU sanctions following Russia's annexation of Crimea. The documents reveal for the first time how the bank operates. Money has been channelled through offshore companies, two of which were officially owned by one of the Russian president's closest friends. Concert cellist Sergei Roldugin has known Vladimir Putin since they were teenagers and is godfather to the president's daughter Maria. On paper, Mr Roldugin has personally made hundreds of millions of dollars in profits from suspicious deals. But documents from Mr Roldugin's companies state that: "The company is a corporate screen established principally to protect the identity and confidentiality of the ultimate beneficial owner of the company." The Kremlin spokesman said it was clear the main target of the reports was Mr Putin, as well as Russia's political stability ahead of parliamentary elections. Dmitry Peskov dismissed the investigation as insinuation and speculation, and suggested many of the team of journalists behind it were actually former US state department and CIA officials. Iceland connection Mossack Fonseca data also show how Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson had an undeclared interest in his country's failed banks. Leaked documents show that Mr Gunnlaugsson and his wife bought offshore company Wintris in 2007. He did not declare an interest in the company when entering parliament in 2009. He sold his 50% of Wintris to his wife for $1 (70p), eight months later. The offshore company was used to invest millions of dollars of inherited money, according to a document signed by Mr Gunnlaugsson's wife, Anna Sigurlaug Palsdottir, in 2015. Mr Gunnlaugsson is facing calls for his resignation, but said on Monday that this was not something he was considering. He apologised for his poor performance in an earlier interview, when he walked out after a question about Wintris. The prime minister stressed that his wife had always paid taxes in Iceland. He says he has not broken any rules and his wife did not benefit financially from his decisions. Mossack Fonseca says offshore companies are available worldwide and are used for a variety of legitimate purposes. "If we detect suspicious activity or misconduct, we are quick to report it to the authorities," it said. "Similarly, when authorities approach us with evidence of possible misconduct, we always co-operate fully with them." Jennie Granger, a spokeswoman for the UK's tax authority, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), said the organisation had received "a great deal of information on offshore companies, including in Panama, from a wide range of sources, which is currently the subject of intensive investigation". She said the ICIJ had been asked to share all its data with HMRC.
The California firm, which is due to release a new phone later this year, said it sold 50.8 million iPhones in the period, down 1% year-on-year. Apple boss Tim Cook blamed a "pause" as customers wait for the next iPhone. Shares in the firm fell nearly 2% in after-hours trading after earlier hitting a record high on expectations of better results. Apple reported a 4.6% rise in revenue across the whole company to $52.9bn (£41bn), slightly below analysts' forecasts. The dip in iPhone sales was offset by services, including Apple Pay, iCloud and the App store, which recorded an 18% increase in sales to $7bn. Mr Cook also pointed to growth in sales of Apple Watch, as well as its AirPods and Beats earphones. Despite falling unit sales, revenue from iPhones still climbed 1% to $33.2bn due to "robust" sales of its bigger, more expensive iPhone 7 Plus. Analysis: Expectations high for 10th anniversary iPhone By Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter This is always the least impressive time of year for Apple's earnings, coming as it does after the Christmas period. But worse-than-expected iPhone sales had investors slightly unhappy after anticipation of strong earnings sent shares to record highs earlier on Tuesday. Tim Cook told investors he was also pleased with the continued growth of its Services division - that's things like Apple Music, Apple TV, iTunes and so on - but the health of Apple is only realistically measured with the success of that all-conquering smartphone. Which is why the rest of the year will be exciting to watch. With the iPhone's 10th anniversary upon us, expectations are high for the next device. Anything short of a major improvement would be troubling for investors who are banking on the next iPhone being a blockbuster, not an incremental upgrade. Analysts at GlobalData Retail noted that Apple's revenue from iPhones was $7bn less than the same period two years ago. "We highlight these facts not to be unduly harsh to Apple, but to indicate that the company has only partially emerged from the slump that hit it over the last fiscal year," Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note. "In our view, the company's mature product line up and an absence of any significant new devices mean it has struggled to regain all of the lost ground," he added. China, which was partly to blame for the slowdown last year, was again difficult for Apple. Revenue from China dropped 14%, although Mr Cook partly blamed currency fluctuations for the fall. Tim Coulling, senior analyst at Canalys, said the Chinese smartphone market was highly competitive, with cheaper products that matched Apple in terms of specification. He said it was "difficult to come up with something truly revolutionary", but he expected their new device to have a bigger screen. Apple said quarterly profits were $11bn worldwide, up 4.9% from the same period in 2016. The firm also announced it would return an extra $50bn to shareholders. Apple's cash holdings have risen to a record $256.8bn and the company has come under increasing pressure to disclose its plans for the money.
The package arrived safely at its destination in Cambridge, 13 minutes after being ordered. A video showing the process details how the order was completed using an electrically powered drone flying at up to 400ft (122m). One sceptic questioned how much of a "game changer" the limited trial of the service would be. As part of the testing for the Amazon Air service, the delivery took place on 7 December, although it was only revealed on 14 December. The Cambridge fulfilment centre is home to the drones, which, once the ordered package is on board, travel along an automated track to the launch area. The drones then take off and fly completely autonomously, guided by GPS to their destination. They are capable of carrying items weighing up to 2.7kg (5lbs). Need for speed The aim is that all orders made using Amazon Air will be delivered within 30 minutes. The trial will be expanded to dozens of customers living close to the warehouse in the coming months. The safety of drones has come under the spotlight in recent months. There have been reports of near-misses this year between drones and aircraft at London Stansted and Cornwall Airport Newquay. "Safety is our top priority," Amazon said on its website. "We are currently permitted to operate during daylight hours when there are low winds and good visibility, but not in rain, snow or icy conditions." There are Prime Air development centres in the US, UK, Austria and Israel. The company is also testing its drone vehicles in "multiple international locations". Retail shifts "This is a marketing coup for Amazon," said Natalie Berg, an analyst at Planet Retail. "The real significance here is the impact it has on shopper expectations. "Last year, same-day delivery was considered impressive; now it's all about 13 minute lead times. "Over the past few years, we've seen a proliferation in delivery options as retailers scramble to cater to changing shopping habits. "Fulfilment has become a firm battleground in retail and the most successful retailers today are those who can deliver products to shoppers in the quickest, most convenient and economical way. "Drone delivery is another string to Amazon's bow, but it's certainly not an industry game changer."
IS began demolishing the site, which was founded in the 13th Century BC, on Thursday, according to Iraqi officials. The head of the UN's cultural agency condemned the "systematic" destruction in Iraq as a "war crime". IS, which controls large areas of Iraq and Syria, says shrines and statues are "false idols" that have to be smashed. "They are erasing our history," said Iraqi archaeologist Lamia al-Gailani. Nimrud lies on the Tigris river, about 30km (18 miles) south-east of Mosul, which IS controls. Many of the artefacts found there have been moved to museums in Baghdad and overseas, but many remain on site. BBC Middle East correspondent Jim Muir says the attempt to destroy Nimrud is already being compared with the Taliban's demolition of the Bamiyan Buddha rock sculptures in Afghanistan in 2001. As well as destroying artefacts, Islamic State also trades in them - and the trade is one of its key sources of revenue. 'Levelled' IS "assaulted the historic city of Nimrud and bulldozed it with heavy vehicles," the tourism and antiquities ministry said on Thursday. It said the militants continued to "defy the will of the world and the feelings of humanity", calling for a UN Security Council meeting to discuss how to protect cultural heritage in Iraq. Nimrud covers a large area, and it is not yet clear whether it has been totally destroyed, our correspondent says. But a local tribal source told Reuters news agency: "Islamic State members came to the Nimrud archaeological city and looted the valuables in it and then they proceeded to level the site to the ground. "There used to be statues and walls as well as a castle that Islamic State has destroyed completely." Profile of Nimrud The unrivalled riches of Nimrud Irina Bokova, head of the UN cultural agency Unesco, condemned the assault. "This is yet another attack against the Iraqi people, reminding us that nothing is safe from the cultural cleansing under way in the country," she said. "The deliberate destruction of cultural heritage constitutes a war crime. There is absolutely no political or religious justification for the destruction of humanity's cultural heritage." Dr Gailani told the BBC: "Nimrud for us in Iraq and for me as an archaeologist is one of the most important [sites]. There are still quite a lot of things that are standing - the reliefs and the statues, the famous winged bulls. "They are erasing our history. I wish it was a nightmare and I could wake up." It is a "horrific crime against the cultural heritage of the whole world", said the president of the British Institute for the Study of Iraq, John Curtis, calling Nimrud "the best preserved Assyrian site in Iraq". Last week, IS released a video apparently showing militants with sledgehammers destroying historic artefacts in a museum in Mosul. One militant was seen drilling through and pulling apart what appeared to be a stone winged bull. In the video, the artefacts are described as "false idols" and their destruction justified in religious terms. That attack was also condemned by the UN as a war crime. IS has controlled Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, and nearby areas since June 2014 - a region with nearly 1,800 of the country's 12,000 registered archaeological sites. Iraqi forces and Shia militia, have united to try to drive IS militants from the northern city of Tikrit, with the support of Iran. The militants are also being targeted by a US-led coalition mounting air strikes. On Friday, Iraqi forces were said to have cleared IS fighters from the town of al-Baghdadi, in the western Anbar province, with the support of US-led strikes. The town, which was taken over by IS last month, is about 8km (5 miles) from an air base housing hundreds of US troops who are training Iraqi soldiers.
He vowed to tackle the BBC's "meeting culture", which "hampers creativity". Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, Lord Hall pledged to halve the number of pan-BBC boards and steering groups. He wrote: "This 'bonfire of the boards' should speed up decision-making and release some of the resources currently wasted on bureaucracy for programmes." He added: "A simpler BBC should mean a more creative BBC." In his five months as director general, Lord Hall has faced the fallout from the Jimmy Savile scandal, criticism over the size of management pay-offs and the collapse of the BBC's £98m Digital Media Initiative IT project. In his article, he said the BBC had a lot to learn from companies such as Google and Apple, which he visited on a recent trip to the US. "To launch an initiative, one of our colleagues at Google had to speak to two people," he wrote. "To get agreement to do the BBC's first ebook, someone at the BBC had to speak to more than two dozen." He hailed Silicon Valley's "fail fast culture", which meant it was "much better to kill off what had seemed like a good idea, and be upfront about it, than to work on, hoping it might come good". 'Failed idea' "At the BBC, we wasted nearly £100m on a computer project because no-one was prepared to call time on a failed idea," he wrote. The BBC must be "much clearer" on how decisions were made and who was accountable for them, he added. "We often spend far too long agonising over decisions that other organisations have learnt to make much more efficiently." In evidence to the Pollard Review of the Savile affair, BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten described the corporation's management culture as "dysfunctional" and "chaotic". Lord Hall also said he wanted to see more women on screen and in senior roles. The appointment of Mishal Husain to Radio 4's Today programme was "a good start", he wrote. The director general recently announced a plan to ensure half of all local radio breakfast shows have female presenters on their teams. He also pledged to recruit more people from black and ethnic minority backgrounds.
Jo Song-gil, North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy who went missing in 2018, had been in the South since July 2019, South Korea's parliamentary intelligence committee chief said. If confirmed, Mr Jo would be the most senior defector since 1997. However there is concern for his teenage daughter, who is said to have returned to the North. Italy's foreign ministry says she was repatriated to the North in February 2019 at her own request after her parents went missing. How did Jo Song-gil defect? He disappeared with his wife after leaving the embassy without notice in November 2018, just before his term as North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy was due to end. Reports at the time said the diplomat - the son and son-in-law of high-ranking North Korean officials - was seeking asylum under the protection of Western governments. On Tuesday an opposition South Korean lawmaker said on Facebook that Mr Jo was in the South with his wife and living under protection. On Thursday Jeon Hae-cheol, chairman of the National Assembly's intelligence committee, confirmed this was the case. "Former acting Ambassador Jo came to South Korea voluntarily in July 2019," Mr Jeon said, adding: "He had repeatedly expressed his wish to come to South Korea." The country's intelligence agencies have not yet commented. What about his daughter? Little is known about her other than that she is a teenager. Mr Jeon said Mr Jo had wanted his whereabouts kept secret. "He was concerned for his family remaining in North Korea," Mr Jeon said, in quotes carried by Yonhap news agency. Another former North Korean diplomat, Thae Yong-ho - Pyongyang's former deputy ambassador to the UK who defected to South Korea in 2016 and is now a lawmaker there - said relatives of a defector could face retribution. "Where a defected diplomat lives determines the levels of treatment or punishment to be given to his relatives left in the North. "If he takes asylum in South Korea, he is defined as a traitor, apostate," Mr Thae said, adding: "And no one knows what penalties would be imposed on the family members of a traitor." Another opposition lawmaker, Cho Tae-yong, who is also a former deputy national security advisor, accused the government of leaking information about Mr Jo and described it as an "act that completely lacked humanitarian considerations regarding his daughter". However Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha has said she was "surprised" at news of Mr Jo's whereabouts and shared concerns for his daughter. North Korean diplomats stationed abroad often have to leave several family members behind in Pyongyang, a move expected to prevent them from defecting.
Speaking in Indonesia during her tour of the region, Mrs Clinton said the Asean bloc and China must make "meaningful progress" towards drafting a code of conduct for the disputes. China has competing territorial claims against four Asean member states. The rows have led to increased tensions in the region and fears of conflict. At a news conference with her Indonesian counterpart in the capital, Jakarta, Mrs Clinton said the US did not take a position on territorial disputes. "But we believe the nations of the region should work collaboratively to resolve disputes without coercion, without intimidation and certainly without the use of force," she said. "That is why we encourage Asean and China to make meaningful progress toward finalising a comprehensive code of conduct in order to establish rules of the road and clear procedures for peacefully addressing disagreements." Indonesia has played a leading role in drafting the code of conduct, which China has so far been reluctant to sign up to, preferring to negotiate with individual countries. Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa agreed with Mrs Clinton on the need for the code, saying that without it, "we can be certain of more incidents and tension for our region". US 'at fault' Mrs Clinton flew in to Indonesia from the Cook Islands, where she attended a Pacific summit. She will later meet Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. She is also scheduled to visit China, East Timor and Brunei before heading to the Apec forum in Russia. Her extended visit is being seen as a sign that the US is stepping up its diplomatic offensive in the region, as part of President Barack Obama's "pivot to Asia" in the face of an assertive China. China has overlapping claims with four Asean members in the South China Sea. Earlier this year, vessels from China and the Philippines faced off for several weeks over one area, the Scarborough Shoal. At a regular meeting hosted by Cambodia in July, Asean failed for the first time in its 45-year history to issue a joint statement because of tensions over the disputes. Vietnam and the Philippines have accused host Cambodia of yielding to Chinese pressure to keep the issue off the agenda. Since then, Mr Natalegawa has visited regional leaders in a bid to encourage co-operation and the implementation of a joint code of conduct for all parties who claim the various islands. Mrs Clinton flies to China after Indonesia for two days of talks. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta is also due in China later this month. On Monday a commentary by China's state-run Xinhua news agency said the US needed to prove it was "returning to Asia as a peacemaker, instead of a troublemaker". The security situation in the region was worsening, it said, because South China Sea and East China Sea territorial disputes were escalating. "Washington, which claims not to take sides in the disputes, is partly blamed for fuelling the tensions because it has apparently emboldened certain relevant parties to make provocations against China in order to achieve undeserved territorial gains," the commentary said.
The Chinese firm, which has earmarked $2bn (£1.5bn) for the process, outlined the timetable in a letter to MPs. Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, faces allegations that its equipment could pose a security risk, which it denies. Last year a UK government report highlighted some areas of concern. The letter was sent last week to MPs on the Commons Science and Technology Committee, but made public on Wednesday. In it, Ryan Ding, president of Huawei's carrier business group said the process of adapting its software and engineering processes to meet the UK's requirements was "like replacing components on a high-speed train in motion". Several governments, including those of France and Germany, are also considering whether to allow the use of Huawei equipment in sensitive infrastructure. Australia and New Zealand have joined the US in banning the use of Huawei products in their 5G mobile networks. Western countries' fears around Huawei stem partly from China's 2017 National Intelligence Law. It states that Chinese organisations are obliged to "support, cooperate with, and collaborate in, national intelligence work". This has raised fears that Chinese-made equipment could present a security risk particularly if used in the construction of new 5G networks. Mr Ding said in his letter last week that the company "has never and will never" use its equipment to assist espionage activities. "Huawei is a closely watched company," he said. "Were Huawei ever to engage in malicious behaviour, it would not go unnoticed - and it would certainly destroy our business." British authorities have not found any evidence of spying using Huawei equipment. 'Lack of progress' The US Justice Department has charged Huawei with conspiring to violate US sanctions on Iran and with stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile. In December, Huawei's chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada at the request of the US. Last year's UK government report was written by the Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre (HCSEC), which was set up in 2010 in response to concerns that BT and others' use of the firm's equipment could pose a threat. The body is overseen by UK security officials, including ones from spy agency GCHQ. It said that it was disappointed that there had been a "lack of progress" in tackling previously identified shortcomings.
Paris, 15, is "doing good" and recovering, said Angel Howansky, her grandfather's publicist. Emergency officials said they responded to a reported overdose in the Calabasas area of Los Angeles where Paris lives, but did not identify the patient. Local media say she left the family home at about 02:00 PST (09:00 GMT). Ms Howansky, a long-time publicist for Joe Jackson - Michael Jackson's father and the girl's grandfather - could not confirm reports of a possible drug overdose or multiple cuts on her wrist. But she later said that Paris was "doing good". "She's recovering and, you know, a good thing it wasn't an intensive care situation," she said. "She's going to be fine." Perry Sanders, a lawyer for grandmother and guardian Katherine Jackson, later said Paris was "physically fine and is getting appropriate medical attention". "Being a sensitive 15-year-old is difficult no matter who you are. It is especially difficult when you lose the person closest to you," he added. In a statement, Paris's uncles Tito, Marlon and Jackie said: "Thank you for the outpouring of concern and support for Paris. "She is safe and doing fine. We truly appreciate you respecting our family's privacy at this time.'' Paris, Michael Jackson's only daughter, is currently part of a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the concert promoters AEG Live, which the Jackson family says bears responsibility for her father's death from an accidental drug overdose in June 2009. Popular target Paris is a cheerleader at her private school and seems comfortable in the limelight - appearing poised and articulate at Michael Jackson tribute events with her grandmother and her two brothers, known as Prince and Blanket. She is also a popular target for the paparazzi and tabloids, our reporter adds. Paris also has a popular Twitter account where she discusses music and homework and dispenses make-up tips to her million-plus followers. Her most recent tweet was a quote from a famous Beatles song: "yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away now it looks as though they're here to stay."
The decision had been based not on an examination of Hamas' actions, but on "factual imputations derived from the press and the internet", judges found. The court said the move was technical and was not a reassessment of Hamas' classification as a terrorist group. It said a funding freeze on the group would continue for the time being. Hamas dominates Gaza and fought a 50-day war with Israel earlier this year. Under its charter, the movement is committed to Israel's destruction. Responding to the ruling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas was a "murderous terrorist organisation" which should be put back on the list immediately. Israel, the United States and several other nations have designated Hamas a terrorist organisation due to its long record of attacks and its refusal to renounce violence. Hamas, which was founded in 1987, won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 and reinforced its power in Gaza the following year after ousting its Fatah rivals. Its supporters see it as a legitimate resistance movement against Israel, with whom it has fought for years. 'Historical mistake' In December 2001, the Council of the European Union - representing the governments of member states - adopted a "common position" and a regulation to combat terrorism. It established a list of designated entities and people whose funds would be frozen. Hamas' military wing, the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, was named on the initial list, and its political wing was added two years later. Hamas contested the decision and on Wednesday the EU's General Court found it had been "based not on acts examined and confirmed in decisions of competent authorities but on factual imputations derived from the press and the internet". The court said it was therefore annulling Hamas' designation but would temporarily keep existing measures against the group "in order to ensure the effectiveness of any possible future freezing of funds". This would be maintained for three months, or, if an appeal is brought before the European Court of Justice, until it was closed, it added. "The court stresses that those annulments, on fundamental procedural grounds, do not imply any substantive assessment of the question of the classification of Hamas as a terrorist group within the meaning of the common position." Hamas deputy political leader Moussa Abu Marzouk said the decision was "a correction of a historical mistake". "Hamas is a resistance movement and it has a natural right according to all international laws and standards to resist the occupation," he told the Reuters news agency. But European Commission spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic said the EU continued to "consider Hamas a terrorist organisation" and would consider its response to the ruling. The Israeli economy minister called the court's decision immoral. "Israel is strong and can defend itself against its enemies, but those who will suffer from strengthening terrorist groups will be the Europeans themselves," Naftali Bennett warned. Hours after the ruling, the European Parliament adopted a compromise resolution supporting "in principle recognition of Palestinian statehood and the two-state solution", and calling for peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians to be "advanced". The original text had called for unconditional recognition, in line with resolutions passed by several national legislatures in recent months.
The Harry Potter author was revealed as the writer of crime novel The Cuckoo's Calling in the Sunday Times. She found out the leak came from law firm Russells, whom she had assumed she "could expect total confidentiality from". "I feel very angry that my trust turned out to be misplaced. "To say that I am disappointed is an understatement," she said in a statement. "A tiny number of people knew my pseudonym and it has not been pleasant to wonder for days how a woman whom I had never heard of prior to Sunday night could have found out something that many of my oldest friends did not know," she added. Russells Solicitors said it apologised "unreservedly". In a statement, it said one of its partners, Chris Gossage, had told his wife's best friend, Judith Callegari, that Robert Galbraith was really Rowling. The company said it was revealed "during a private conversation" adding "the disclosure was made in confidence to someone he trusted implicitly". It has been reported Ms Callegari subsequently revealed Rowling's identity to a Sunday Times journalist via Twitter on 9 July. Russells continued: "Whilst accepting [Gossage's] own culpability, the disclosure was made in confidence to someone he trusted implicitly. On becoming aware of the circumstances, we immediately notified JK Rowling's agent." Marketing plan There had been speculation leaking the name was part of a publicity campaign. However Russells said: "We can confirm that this leak was not part of any marketing plan and that neither JK Rowling, her agent nor publishers were in any way involved." The Cuckoo's Calling - believed to be the debut novel of Galbraith - tells of war veteran-turned private investigator Cormoran Strike and received good reviews when it was first published. It had sold 1,500 copies before Rowling was revealed as the author, but within hours it rose more than 5,000 places to top Amazon's sales list. When she was revealed as Galbraith, Rowling said she had found writing under a pseudonym "a liberating experience". She issued a statement saying she had "hoped to keep this secret a little longer" but added it had "been wonderful to publish without hype or expectation, and pure pleasure to get feedback under a different name".
The chairman of the Eurogroup, Mário Centeno, announced the deal, reached after marathon discussions in Brussels. It comes as Spain's prime minister said the country was close to passing the worst of its coronavirus outbreak. Spain has Europe's highest number of confirmed cases, with 152,446. More than 15,000 people have died. The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned the world is facing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Kristalina Georgieva said the coronavirus pandemic would turn economic growth "sharply negative" this year. At their Brussels talks, EU ministers failed to accept a demand from France and Italy to share out the cost of the crisis by issuing so-called coronabonds. The package finally agreed is smaller than the European Central Bank (ECB) had urged. The ECB has said the bloc may need up to €1.5tn (£1.3tn) to tackle the crisis. However, the French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, hailed the agreement as the most important economic plan in EU history. "Europe has decided and is ready to meet the gravity of the crisis," he tweeted after the talks. The main component of the rescue plan involves the European Stability Mechanism, the EU's bailout fund, which will make €240bn available to guarantee spending by indebted countries under pressure. The EU ministers also agreed other measures including €200bn in guarantees from the European Investment Bank and a European Commission project for national short-time working schemes. Ministers were close to a deal on Wednesday, but the talks broke down and had to be resumed a day later, amid a dispute between Italy and the Netherlands over how to apply the recovery fund. "Our faith in Europe has proven correct!" tweeted the Italian president of the European Parliament, David Sassoli triumphantly, as soon as EU finance ministers announced the deal. So is he right: is everything hunky-dory now in the EU? The dark mutterings of deep divisions banished? Not really. The EU is stumbling through this crisis as it has done through the migration and the financial crises before, for instance. The bloc is not about to disintegrate but scars will remain in countries that felt the chilly absence of EU solidarity in their hour of coronavirus need. "This has not been our finest moment," a diplomat from an influential EU country told me. "Our response has come late and has been marred by nationalism. Solidarity went out the window with the first coronavirus victim." Read more from Katya Adler The coronavirus pandemic has exposed deep divisions in Europe, where Italy and Spain have accused northern nations - led by Germany and the Netherlands - of not doing enough. Speaking before the agreement, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told the BBC that the EU needs to rise to the challenge of what he calls "the biggest test since the Second World War." The infection rate is slowing in Italy. Latest figures show positive cases increasing from the previous day by a little over 1%. Two weeks ago, the rise was 7%. The death rate is also falling. Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez also said the situation there was improving. He told MPs in Madrid on Thursday: "The fire starts to come under control." He vowed that the country would have "total victory" over the virus. According to latest data from the past 24 hours, Spain has recorded 683 deaths - a drop from the 757 reported on Wednesday. Will lockdown be relaxed after Easter? In recent days, leaders have begun to sound more positive. Small, non-essential shops are set to open in Austria and Czech Republic next week. Denmark's schools and kindergartens will reopen on 15 April, and Norway's on 20 April. Even Italy is considering when some lockdown measures could gradually be relaxed. Mr Conte said: "If scientists confirm it, we might be able to relax some measures already by the end of this month." However Spain extended its state of emergency on Thursday until 26 April, keeping people at home for a further two weeks. There are also widespread concerns about the Easter weekend, when people usually travel to see loved ones. Portugal has tightened lockdown measures for Easter, with a ban on people leaving their local area without official documentation.
Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah on Sunday extended a moratorium on the death penalty to cover the new legislation. The rethink follows global outcry over the laws, including boycotts and celebrity protests. While still on the statute books for some crimes, no executions have been carried out in Brunei since 1957. Last month Brunei rolled out a strict new interpretation of Islamic laws, or Sharia. In a speech, the sultan said he was aware there had been "many questions and misperceptions" regarding the implementation of the legislation, called Syariah Penal Code Order (SPCO). While saying that a moratorium on the death penalty would be applied to the SPCO he also defended the new rules, saying their "merit" would become clear. The speech marks the first time the country's ruler has spoken publicly about the legislation since their introduction. Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland said she was "delighted the death penalty has been removed and that the de facto moratorium which has been in place for more than two decades, will also cover the SPCO". Homosexuality was already illegal in Brunei and punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Muslims make up about two-thirds of the country's population of 420,000. What are the laws? The small South-East Asian nation first introduced Sharia law in 2014, giving it a dual legal system with both Sharia and Common Law. The first phase covered crimes punishable by prison sentences and fines. The laws introduced on 3 April marked the next phase of the legislation, and covered crimes punishable by amputation and stoning. Under the legislation: What was the reaction? The laws sparked international outrage, throwing the tiny South-East Asian nation into the global spotlight. Ahead of their implementation, the UN warned that the laws contravened international human rights standards set out in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights - which was ratified by Brunei in 2006. Celebrities including George Clooney and Elton John called for a boycott of luxury hotels with links to Brunei over the legislation. Mr Clooney said the new laws amounted to "human rights violations". Many in Brunei's gay community expressed shock and fear at the punishments.
By Yvette TanBBC News But this is not the first time a military coup has taken place in Myanmar, also known as Burma. In fact for many, it's reminiscent of one that took place in the late 1980s. "It kinda felt like deja vu, it's like we're back to square one," a 25-year-old told the BBC. Here's what it was like growing up under junta rule. 'I grew up with fear' Wai Wai Nu was five when her father was snatched before her eyes. A political activist affiliated with civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, he was bundled up into a truck and taken away. He may have been freed after a month, but even now, she can remember how she felt that day. "I grew up with that constant fear," she said. "I was always scared as a child. There were always soldiers outside and I can still picture my father taken away from me. I remember we would put in earphones and listen to the radio very softly." Wai Wai - who is a Rohingya, one of the most persecuted ethnic minorities in the country - says her father was always being chased. When she was 10, the family decided to move to the then capital Yangon (Rangoon). "I did see a bit more liberty in Yangon," she said. "In Rakhine, the majority of the population are Rohingya but in Yangon, it's more multicultural with different languages. But a lot of people in Yangon have no knowledge of what's happening with ethnic minorities." At that time, life seemed to her to be pretty normal. "We would go to school then go home. At school, I remember we had to welcome different generals and pay tribute to them. The education system is simply, military propaganda." But then, when she was 18, her father was targeted again, and the entire family was put into jail, where they remained for seven years. Her crime? Being the daughter of a political activist. After she was freed, she went on to go to university and today works as a human rights activist, campaigning especially for equal rights for women and for the Rohingya. "Growing up, Rakhine state was poor but it wasn't bad, people were still able to run their businesses," she said. "It's not like how it is today." An eavesdropper on the phone Phyo (not her real name) had a very different experience growing up. Coming from a more affluent family, the Yangon-born and bred 25-year-old says she was largely shielded from what was happening outside. But even as a child, some things stood out. "When you spoke on the phone, you could hear a sound in the background - someone watching TV or just people talking. It was the military listening to you," she said. "It wasn't scary, because when you're born into it, you don't know the alternative but our parents would tell us not to talk on the phone." Phyo was born in 1995, just three years after military dictator Than Shwe came to power. She describes the year she was born as "the deepest height of military rule after the '88 revolution". In school she says, the school curriculum was one that was very selective in what they taught students. "They didn't teach sensitive stuff. For example if in the US they might make you critique a political situation, we would instead be doing reading comprehension about Buddhist tales," she said. "Or you would learn that the Burmese kings were really great until it was all taken away by the British." The British controlled the country from 1824 to 1948. She was, however, largely sheltered from the country's political happenings until the age of 12. "I still remember it was my 12th birthday when the Saffron Revolution happened," she said. "That's when it hit me - that we are living in a dictatorship." The so-called Saffron Revolution was a series of street protests in Myanmar in 2007 which saw thousands of the country's monks rise up against the military regime. Monks are revered by most people in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, but many of them were jailed during the protests, and there are reports of at least three monks being killed by security forces. "I saw a lot of protesters outside my house, and there was this tension and fear in the air, there were soldiers everywhere," Phyo said. Growing up as a teenager, cell phones were largely non-existent - used only by those who could afford them, she says. "They made cell phones very expensive, so no one could afford them. Back then people only had landlines, and sometimes there would be electricity blackouts so you couldn't even talk to anyone." Phyo eventually went on to attend university overseas, where she realised how different some things were in the West compared with Myanmar. "I remember if there was a police officer my friends would be like, that's so scary!" she said. "But for me, it's so normal for there to be soldiers everywhere." On the morning of 1 February, she says she woke up at 6am to dozens of notifications on her phone. "You just wake up and suddenly your whole government is arrested," she said. "When I was young, you would wake up to news like this - people suddenly going to prison, or people disappearing. It kinda felt like déjà vu, it's like we're back to square one - how things used to be. All the work we've done, any legitimacy we've given to the government. It's all gone." Living in silence Kyaw Than Win, 67, still remembers where he was when the military coup happened in 1988. He lived in Min Bu township, a city in central Myanmar. He recalls that there was "shooting and violence" in other places, but added that Min Bu remained relatively quite and calm. For most people, he said, life continued as normal - and speaking out was not an option. "We went back to work. Some civil servants who were involved in leading the protests were dismissed and some demoted and transferred, others were detained," he told the BBC. "But for civil servants like me, we got back to work like normal. We had to force ourselves to live life in silence out of fear." Life continued mostly like that until the 2015 elections - the country's first national vote in decades. Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy won a landslide victory - ending nearly 50 years of military rule. "I was very happy and pleased to have someone like her run the country. They did a great job. Basic public infrastructure was improved, and the lives of civil servants were improved," he said. "Life became a lot better." However, this period was shortlived, it turns out. Kyaw Than Win said the decision by the military to stage the 1 February coup ignored the "wish of millions of people". According to Professor Simon Tay, chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, the Tatmadaw (Burmese armed forces) still believe that only they can be trusted to safeguard Myanmar's unity. "Despite the NLD sweeping two elections, they do not accept that they must step back from national politics," he told the BBC. However, he adds that "few, even in the military, wish to return to the decades when the country was mired by autocracy, economic sanctions and mass poverty". "But Myanmar's opening and transition are far from complete - and the military will do what they feel they must." Additional reporting by Yip Wai Yee
"We're about 10 days away from seeing widespread shortages," Bill de Blasio said on Sunday. "If we don't get more ventilators people will die." New York state has become the epicentre of the outbreak in the US and accounts for almost half of the country's cases. There are now 31,057 confirmed cases nationwide, with 390 deaths. On Sunday, the state's Governor Andrew Cuomo said 15,168 people had tested positive for the virus, an increase of more than 4,000 from the previous day. "All Americans deserve the blunt truth," Mr de Blasio told NBC News. "It's only getting worse, and in fact April and May are going to be a lot worse." New York now accounts for roughly 5% of Covid-19 cases worldwide. On Friday, President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for the state which gave it access to billions of dollars of federal aid. However, Mr de Blasio has continued to criticise the administration for what he views as an inadequate response. "I cannot be blunt enough: if the president doesn't act, people will die who could have lived otherwise," he said. "This is going to be the greatest crisis, domestically, since the Great Depression," he added, referring to the economic crisis of the 1930s. Speaking at a news conference at the White House on Sunday, Mr Trump said he had also approved a major disaster declaration for Washington state and would approve a similar measure for California. "This is a challenging time for all Americans. We're enduring a great national trial," he said. President Trump also said a number of medical supplies were being sent to locations nationwide, as well as emergency medical stations for New York, Washington and California, the worst-hit states. Doctors across New York have reported depleted medical supplies and a lack of protective gear for healthcare workers on the frontlines of the outbreak. Warnings of such shortages have reverberated across the country as other state governors have pleaded with the federal government to make more supplies available. In California, officials instructed hospitals to restrict coronavirus testing. Meanwhile, a hospital in Washington state - once the centre of the US outbreak - said it could run out of ventilators by April. And on Sunday, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said states were "competing against each other" for virus supplies. "We need millions of masks and hundreds of thousands of gowns and gloves," he said. "We're getting just a fraction of that. So, we're out on the open market competing for these items that we so badly need." An almost $1.4 trillion (£1.2 trillion) emergency stimulus bill intended to blunt the punishing economic impact of the pandemic failed to pass the US Senate on Sunday. The bill got 47 votes, falling short of the 60 needed in the 100-member chamber. Democrats raised objections to the bill with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer saying it had "many, many problems". Democrats accused Republicans of wanting to bail out big businesses. Talks between Democrats and the White House are continuing.
In a televised address she said she would draft a new plan to benefit public transport and that all oil royalties would be used in education. She also said that thousands of doctors would be drafted in from overseas to improve the national health service. Earlier she held an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the protests. The demonstrations began over transport fare rises in Sao Paulo, but quickly grew into rallies across the country against corruption and other issues. On Thursday night more than a million people took to the streets and there was violence in various cities in which dozens were injured and two people died. Protests continued on Friday with an estimated 1,000 people marching in Rio de Janeiro. Witnesses said some stores were looted and an empty arts centre building was invaded. Police were pelted with rocks and responded with tear gas. Demonstrations also took place in Sao Paulo, where traffic was brought to a halt but no violence was reported, and in Fortaleza in Brazil's north-east. In her address - pre-recorded and broadcast nationally on TV and radio - Mrs Rousseff said she was listening to the demonstrators' concerns. She promised to meet the leaders of the peaceful protests saying she needed "their contribution, their energy and their ability". Football anger The BBC's Gary Duffy in Sao Paulo says President Rousseff struck a conciliatory note for the most challenging speech she has had to make as Brazil's leader. "I want institutions that are more transparent, more resistant to wrongdoing," she said. She also defended hosting next year's football World Cup saying Brazil had always been welcomed in international events. "We will treat our guests with respect and make a great World Cup," she said. Answering criticism of the cost of hosting the event, she said the World Cup would be financed by companies that are making use of the sporting arenas. "I would never allow this money to come out of the taxpayers' money, harming essential areas such as health and education," she said. Some of the protests have targeted the Confederations Cup, the eight-team tournament currently taking place which is considered a dry run for next year's World Cup. Demonstrators have expressed their anger at steep ticket prices and the money spent on both tournaments, as well as the 2016 Olympic Games, which Rio de Janeiro is hosting. Football's world governing body, Fifa, has strongly rejected Brazilian media speculation that the Confederations Cup could be cancelled. Belem Brasilia Belo Horizonte Sao Paulo Fortaleza Salvador Rio de Janeiro Porto Alegre Belem In the city of Belem - at the mouth of the Amazon River - riot police clashed with stone-throwing protesters. Demonstrators also hung protest banners and flags on City Hall. Brasilia In the capital Brasilia, demonstrators targeted government buildings around the city's central esplanade. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to try to scatter the crowds. Belo Horizonte Police and protesters clashed in the eastern city of Belo Horizonte, which hosted a game in the Confederations Cup - the warm-up tournament for the World Cup. Sao Paulo The widespread demonstrations taking place across the country followed a police crackdown on smaller protests in Sao Paulo, which galvanized Brazilians to take to the streets. The city saw thousands gather once again near the city's landmark Avenida Paulista late on Thursday. Fortaleza At least 30,000 people rallied in the north-eastern city of Fortaleza ahead of the Confederations Cup game with Mexico this week. Brazilian police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protesters. Salvador There were clashes outside a football stadium in Salvador ahead of a Confederations Cup football match between Nigeria and Uruguay. Police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. Rio de Janeiro Rio de Janeiro has seen some of the worst unrest. Late on Thursday, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at groups of masked young men trying to approach the City Hall. A number of people were injured. Porto Alegre Earlier this week, more than 40 people were arrested in the southern city of Porto Alegre after a small group peeled away from a protest march of about 10,000 demonstrators to attack shops.
The South Korean company said profit fell 60% to 4.1tn won ($3.8bn; £2.5bn) in the three months to September. The results were in line with the firm's preliminary estimates released earlier this month. Shares of the world's biggest smartphone-maker have lost nearly 20% of their value this year. Samsung's mobile division, its biggest business, has been struggling to maintain its dominance against rivals such as Apple, which recently released the new iPhone 6. Its flagship Galaxy smartphone line has been losing market share to Chinese smartphone-makers Xiaomi and Lenovo, which sell cheaper models that also have large screens and multiple features. Samsung said market competition is "expected to further intensify". "Although the company anticipates a demand growth for the recently launched Galaxy Note 4 and new middle-end smartphone models, uncertainty remains," the firm said in a statement. It said the year-end surge in competitor smartphone launches "may require a potential increase in marketing expenses associated with year-end promotions".
Workers from Nepal, Sri Lanka and India say they are still owed 13 months' wages after the contractor collapsed. Some workers had been left stranded in the country, working for as little as $0.85 a day (50p), The Guardian said. In May, Qatar vowed to improve the rights of migrants in the Gulf state amid growing alarm at their treatment. But an investigation by the British newspaper found migrants who had worked on the Qatar 2022 offices in the Al Bidda skyscraper in Doha were still waiting for their pay. The project, which The Guardian says was commissioned by the Qatari government, was carried out by migrants working for the contractor Lee Trading. It cost $4.25m (£2.5m) and the offices were fitted with expensive etched glass and handmade Italian furniture. But Lee Trading's collapse led to Amnesty International raising the case with Qatar's prime minister last November after many of the workers were left stranded. The situation has remained the same and five of the workers have since been arrested and imprisoned after being left without ID papers. In a statement released on Monday, Qatar 2022 said it was "heavily dismayed to learn of the behaviour of Lee Trading with regard to the timely payment of its workers." Officials said they relayed the concerns raised by Amnesty to the "relevant authorities" last year and insisted they would "continue to press for a speedy and fair conclusion to all cases." Qatar moved to change controversial laws on foreign workers in May that tied migrant workers to a single employer. Human rights campaigners had accused that sponsorship system of being akin to modern-day slavery. The Gulf state has seen an influx of foreign workers ahead of the football tournament and expatriates now make up the bulk of the workforce in the country.
One idea he suggested was limiting the number of children in a family that would be supported on benefits. Is it right to cut benefits in an attempt to bring down Britain's deficit? Does it make for good economics? Or good politics? Here are the opinions of a range of commentators, charities, think tanks and those who are on benefits - or managing without them. Kelly Spencer, 32, single parent to four young children, from Westbury, Wiltshire I'm in receipt of income support of £125 per fortnight, child tax credits of £230 per week, child benefit of £220 per month, housing benefit of £400 per month and council tax benefit of £100 per month. I'm an engineering graduate and I was made redundant just before my youngest child was born. I believe that everyone in this country should bear the brunt of the cuts, but at a level they can afford. I think it is wrong to cut benefits to such a level that people suffer extreme hardship and social inequality, especially where children are involved. I feel the politicians are out of touch and have led very privileged lives. I do not trust this government to look after vulnerable people. They don't seem to care. I can't understand why wealthy people are receiving child benefit - they don't need it. I know some people who give it straight to their kids as pocket money. Why are wealthy pensioners getting universal benefits such as bus pass or fuel allowances? I feel that the government is demonising people on benefits in order to gain popular support for policies. I feel like it is all about the votes and not about the real people it affects. I think it would be better politics to target people who break the law and cost the country a fortune - tax evaders or criminals, for example. I don't believe that cutting benefits makes economic sense in the long term. We will end up with a social underclass, resentment rising and an increase in crime and mental illness from stress of struggling to survive. All of this will cost the country dearly. Jurgita Sirvydiene, 31, admin worker, of Hornchurch, Essex, originally from Lithuania I was very pleased when I saw this on the news. My husband (who is 32 and a carpenter) and I have been working in this country for more than nine years now, we both have full-time jobs. I come from Lithuania and I was shocked that people in the UK on benefits can afford better life than the ones who work. This is totally wrong. The government should stop encouraging people to be out of work by paying them a fair amount of money, also it is not right that people on benefits can have two or more children, where working families can't afford to have children at all. In my opinion they are doing the right thing by cutting benefits, so people will have to get a job. If their earnings are not enough to survive on, only then should they be offered financial help. We need to forget the something-for-nothing culture. Finally George is doing something about it. They give too much money to the wrong people who are milking the system. It's not right. I think they need to be stricter. I earn £315 a week in hand, which works out as about £19,500 before tax a year. When I go on maternity leave I will be on 40% of my wages while people on benefits can afford to stay at home and have as many children as they like. Owen Jones, columnist at the Independent and author of Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class In the most cynical way possible, cutting benefits can certainly make good politics. Since coming to power, the government has attempted to turn the working poor against the unemployed, and the disabled against the non-disabled, over benefits. As a result, it has had some success in redirecting people's anger from those at the top who caused the crisis, to people's neighbours down the streets. But it is wrong to make the poorest pay for a crisis they did not create; and - given it doesn't address the root causes of welfare spending - these cuts will suck demand out of the economy as well as making people's lives a misery. It is possible to bring down welfare spending without savage cuts. Billions of pounds are wasted on housing benefit, but it's lining the pockets of wealthy landlords - not tenants - because both New Labour and the Tories failed to build social housing. Building modern housing would create jobs, stimulate the economy, bring down the five million-strong social housing waiting list - and cut welfare spending. Ruth Porter, Communications Director at free-market think tank the Institute of Economic Affairs Welfare accounts for around 25% of government expenditure. It would be very difficult to bring down the deficit without reducing the welfare budget. By 2010 Gordon Brown had reformed welfare so that around a third of all UK households received more than 50% of their income from taxpayers. Not only would tackling this problem of welfare dependency help incentivise people to work harder and save more, it would also help to grow the economy by creating more opportunity and investment for the private sector. George Osborne argued in his conference speech that the government will look to govern in the national interest. It is time then for him to look at bringing to an end non-means-tested benefits for the elderly and to reduce other welfare payments that have gone beyond simply providing a safety net. Helen Barnard, programme manager for poverty at anti-poverty charity, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation More welfare cuts will not reduce people's dependency on the state. Cutting benefits for groups who receive little public sympathy may make for a good conference speech, but it risks increasing poverty and hardship. And unless there is a follow-up "master plan" for creating more and better jobs, massively increasing access to them and sorting out the housing crisis, it's not likely to do as much as those advocating further cuts are hoping to reduce the deficit or people's dependency on the state. Youth homelessness is driven by relationship breakdown. Our research shows that the assumption that most young people receiving housing benefit could happily and safely live with mum and dad until they get a stable, decently paid job and move into a basic but adequate shared flat is a world away from the lives of many poor, young people. This is reinforced by the statistics on underemployment - 6m people want to work more but can't. It also demonstrates that just "getting a job" isn't the whole point: millions are trapped in a cycle of poorly paid, insecure work and unemployment, with little prospect of breaking into better jobs. Getting a job is still the best route out of poverty. But these kinds of jobs aren't a very good route. When someone in a family in poverty gets a job, only 56% are lifted out of poverty. We are hoping to address these issues with a new programme to develop a UK-wide anti-poverty strategy based on the best evidence across all the areas that contribute to poverty. Maybe it'll catch on. Matthew Sinclair, chief executive, the Taxpayers' Alliance The welfare system needs to treat the taxpayers who pick up the bill fairly, not just those claiming benefits. It is important to encourage people to work, but also to ensure that those living on benefits don't enjoy a lifestyle which many families paying their own way could never afford. The benefits bill is way too high and steps must be taken to ensure that welfare spending is sustainable. It is wrong to characterise these plans as a way of quickly cutting the deficit - they aren't a short term fix. But they are vital to delivering value for money for taxpayers in the long run. The chancellor has to get the economy moving again by reforming taxes and leaving more money in people's pockets as well, so fewer people rely on handouts in the first place. Kay Bews, chief executive of family support charity, Home-Start UK We acknowledge that hard decisions need to be made, but this one is potentially giving rise to further difficulties and therefore costs in the future. Has Mr Osborne realised the impact this will have on families across society? Home-Start is seeing families who are at breaking point - many of those families were "coping before", getting by, but having to now support their families with even less money is tipping them over the edge. The families we work with who are claiming benefits are trying to do the best under very difficult circumstances. Very few benefits claimants choose that way of keeping a roof over their heads or food in their children's mouths - most simply don't have the option. And in times of economic stress, a cut in benefits will also affect the current tax payers who suddenly find themselves redundant. Home-Start is seeing the working poor unable to make ends meet. Removing benefits will not necessarily push families into work. A safety net is needed for all. We need to take a much longer-term view - possibly over generations. Investment in early intervention for families - whether they are working or on benefits - will help reduce police, prison, drug and alcohol, social services and national health service bills by billions of pounds in the longer term. But only time and hindsight will tell. It's potentially divisive [in terms of politics]. Will the long-term employed vote if they suddenly find that there is little or no support for them if they lose their job? There is also a real risk of widening the gap between families who once were coping with their finances and now won't be able to. Claire Fox, director of the Institute of Ideas, which debates social issues Yes it is right to cut benefits: less because it saves money in a narrow way, and more because it is a challenge to an unhelpful climate of complacency and dependency. It could be a commitment to make all sections of society focus on wealth creation and not on handouts. Of course for those million young people out of work in the UK, it can be galling when their meagre £71 a week unemployment pay is described as exemplifying a "culture of entitlement"; when it seems those with least are the focus of the government's economic strategy. But my problem with contemporary welfarism is that it has long moved beyond its original remit of providing a safety net or delivering universal public services. Growing numbers have become permanently and cripplingly dependent on what was envisaged as a temporary measure in hard times. A mood of passively expecting the state to provide rather than a resilient atmosphere of ambitious, get-up-and-go dominates culture. The welfare state's expansion into every nook and cranny of too many people's lives has been less about saving people from deprivation and expresses more a condescending middle-class view of people as helpless and hapless unless the state helps them to parent correctly, improve their lifestyles, cut down on smoking or drinking, etc. Frankly, we should welcome cuts in a bureaucratic system that actively undermines people's autonomy and independence. And one reason these cuts are more popular with the vast majority of ordinary people, as opposed to professional hand-wringers, is they know damn well that over-weaning welfarism saps morale and is good for no-one. Ironically the coalition seems to be a reluctant cutter, for all the rhetoric. The so-called austerity harshness of lowering housing benefit limits from £20,000 annually- £1,700 a month - generous by anyone's budgetary standard - indicates just how much waste there is in the system: it's more about subsidising the social housing sector, than helping the needy. The solution of course would be ensuring millions more affordable homes and rents. And targeting under-25-year-olds makes some sense. This is after all the most dynamic section of society - with youth on their side they should be kicking out, not just against their parents and elders, but against a system that implies they won't be able to cope without official charity. So benefit cuts can mean freedom from dependence as much as hardship and at least need to considered by progressives rather than demonised as Thatcherite attacks on the poor. But without an equally ambitious plan for economic growth, Osborne's projected cuts will just cause pain without sufficient gain.
It was "abhorrent" British citizens had "declared their allegiance" to groups like Islamic State, he told MPs. He said the inability to stop UK terrorists returning home from overseas was "a gap in the armoury" but only pledged cross-party talks on the issue. Powers to monitor suspects in the UK will also be strengthened. In a statement to Parliament, Mr Cameron restated the UK's backing for US airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and said he would not rule out participation in similar action in the future. The UK's terror threat level was raised to "severe" from "substantial" on Friday. 'Forensic focus' The prime minister told MPs that developments in the Middle East over recent months had major implications for the UK's security, with 500 British nationals estimated to have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight on behalf of Islamic State and other militant groups. He said the whole world had been "sickened and shocked" by the killing of US journalist James Foley and other atrocities in Iraq. While rejecting calls for "sweeping and blanket" new laws in response, he said a "forensic focus" was needed to prevent people from travelling abroad in the first place and to deal with British jihadists returning to the UK from conflict zones. Among measures announced: The home secretary already has executive powers to seize the passports of those travelling abroad in certain cases but Mr Cameron said the police needed greater discretion to act where needed. "We will introduce specific and targeted legislation... providing the police with a temporary power to seize a passport at the border during which time they will be able to investigate the individual concerned," he said. Mr Cameron said the UK was able to block foreign nationals and those with dual citizenship from re-entering the UK but did not have the same power for UK nationals deemed to pose a threat to the country. Under his proposals, UK nationals suspected of being involved in terror acts would be allowed to keep their British citizenship, but they would be prevented from re-entering the UK for a period of time. He added: "Adhering to British values is not an option or a choice. It is a duty for all those who live in these islands so we will stand up for our values, we will in the end defeat this extremism and we will secure our way of life for generations to come." Labour leader Ed Miliband said the opposition would offer broad support to the government in its core objectives of keeping the UK safe but said there was a lack of detail and Mr Cameron had been wrong to abolish the system of control orders - which banned suspects from certain areas - in 2011. "Relocation was indeed a central part of control orders and it was a mistake to get rid of them in the first place," he said. Mr Miliband said a "mandatory and comprehensive programme of de-radicalisation" was needed "not just for those who will be under Tpims but those who have been on the fringes of extremism in Iraq and Syria". Deputy Prime Minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg told the BBC the coalition was "absolutely not repeating the mistakes of the last Labour government, which introduced very faulty control orders that kept being challenged by the courts". It was instead a way to "disrupt the contacts" extremists had "with other people who we think are of real concern". Amid talk of Lib Dem opposition to some of the proposals, former leader Sir Menzies Campbell said the package was "more nuanced" than anticipated but warned that rendering citizens stateless was regarded as illegal in international law. While many Tory MPs backed the measures, former Attorney General Dominic Grieve warned plans to bar UK nationals from returning home risked "flouting principles of international law and of English common law" and called for prosecutions in the UK where possible. It is already a criminal offence to travel abroad to commit or prepare a terrorist offence or to travel for the purpose of terrorist training, with suspects able to be prosecuted in the UK. Clive Coleman, BBC Legal Affairs Correspondent There is a real and important difference between removing a person's citizenship and removing their passport. If a British citizen who holds sole British nationality - ie does not have dual citizenship - has his or her British citizenship removed, that would render the person stateless, and that is contrary to both international and domestic law. Under current law, the home secretary is prevented from removing citizenship if to do so would render a citizen stateless. So, in practice, the power can only be used against those with dual citizenship. The government wants to change the law. This could mean that citizenship can be removed from those with sole British nationality. However, we will have to wait and see precisely what the government announces in its package of measures today. If a person with sole British nationality is or has been acting in a way that is "not conducive to the public good", for instance by involving themselves in terrorism, then they can have their passport removed. That can be a temporary measure and does not remove their citizenship. BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the UK was looking at working with Germany, Turkey and other countries through which suspected British jihadists travelled to and from the Middle East to alert them to their presence so they could be detained and questioned before setting foot on UK soil. IS militants have seized swathes of territory in Syria and Iraq and have been condemned for the mass slaughter of religious minorities in the region, including Iraqi Christians and the Yazidi community. The UK is assisting Iraqi and Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State as well as providing humanitarian aid to those displaced by the fighting. On Sunday, the RAF delivered 11 tonnes of equipment directly to the northern city of Irbil, including ammunition supplied by other nations and body armour helmets provided by the UK. A poll by ComRes for the Independent newspaper suggests 35% of people in the UK think the government should launch airstrikes against Islamic State, while 50% think it should not. Pollsters questioned 1,000 adults by telephone between 29 and 31 August.
Attorney General Eric Holder said the alleged breaches were "significant" and demanded "an aggressive response". US prosecutors say the officers stole trade secrets and internal documents from five companies and a labour union. China denied the charges and warned the case would harm US-China relations. Potentially more victims In Washington on Monday, Mr Holder said a grand jury had laid hacking charges against the Chinese nationals, the first against "known state actors for infiltrating US commercial targets by cyber means". He identified the alleged victims as Westinghouse Electric, US Steel, Alcoa Inc, Allegheny Technologies, SolarWorld and the US Steelworkers Union. "The alleged hacking appears to have been conducted for no reason other than to advantage state-owned companies and other interests in China, at the expense of businesses here in the United States," Mr Holder said. He said the US government rejected economic espionage as a trade tactic. "As President Obama has said on numerous occasions, we do not collect intelligence to provide a competitive advantage to US companies, or US commercial sectors," Mr Holder said. In response to the charges, the Chinese government said its "stance on the issue of internet security is consistent and clear". Foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said the allegations were "made up" and would "damage Sino-American co-operation and mutual trust". "China is a staunch defender of network security, and the Chinese government, military and associated personnel have never engaged in online theft of trade secrets," he said. In an indictment in the western district of Pennsylvania, the heart of the US steel industry, the US named Wang Dong, Sun Kailiang, Wen Xinyu, Huang Zhenyu, and Gu Chunhui, all officers in Unit 61398 of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), as the alleged conspirators. FBI officials said the hacking in the years 2006-14 caused "significant losses" at the companies and that there were likely many more victims. John Carlin, head of the justice department's national security division, said, "While the men and women of our American businesses spent their business days innovating, creating, and developing strategies to compete in the global marketplace, these members of unit 61398 spent their business days in Shanghai stealing the fruits of our labour." 'Real threat' For example, Mr Carlin said that as SolarWorld, a maker of solar panels and accessories, was rapidly losing market share to cheaply priced Chinese competitors, the hackers were stealing documents on pricing strategy from them. While Westinghouse was negotiating a deal with a Chinese state-owned firm to build nuclear power plants, Unit 61398 stole secret designs for plant components, he said. "In the past, when we brought concerns such as these to Chinese government officials, they responded by publicly challenging us to provide hard evidence of their hacking that could stand up in court," Mr Carlin said. Last year, cyber-defence company Mandiant published a report on a Chinese military unit the firm said was behind the vast majority of significant attacks on American federal agencies and companies. In March, Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel said the Pentagon planned to more than triple its cyber-security capabilities in the next few years to defend against such internet attacks. US President Barack Obama has called cyber attacks a "real threat" to US security and its economy.
Some 400 works were bequeathed by Chinese art expert Professor Michael Sullivan, who died in September. Many of the pieces by late 20th Century and contemporary Chinese artists have never been seen in public. The works will be displayed on rotation at the Ashmolean in a gallery dedicated to Sullivan and his wife Khoan. Some of the paintings have been loaned to the museum since 2000. They were collected by the couple on their extensive travels to China from the 1940s. Much of the art was gained by the pair directly from the artists, and as gifts from those they made friends with. Among the most significant paintings are by Qi Baishi and Zhang Daqian, who both died in the mid-20th Century, and also include more recent acquisitions, including Landscript by Xu Bing, which was created in 2002. Sullivan retired to Oxford in 1985 after a career as the leading scholar on Chinese art outside the country. He continued to work in the field until shortly before his death, and was honoured with a lifetime achievement award from the American Friends of Shanghai Museum in 2012. BBC Arts Editor Will Gompertz called the new acquisition "an extraordinary gift", adding that modern Chinese art is now the "hottest ticket in town". Curator of the collection, Dr Shelagh Vainker, said Sullivan collected through the 20th Century in every style. "He kept with it all the way and was still acquiring pieces this year," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Dr Vainker added that the collection came with a wealth of supporting material from Sullivan's archive, including correspondence with artists. This adds a great deal of context to the works and how they were acquired over the decades. "As a package, it's not just just the leading collection in the West, it's a unique resource for the whole subject," she said. "The whole field of Chinese art has exploded in the last decade," added Dr Vainker. Professor Christopher Brown, director of the Ashmolean, said he hoped the paintings will be "enjoyed by thousands of visitors and scholars from around the world". "We hope this is a fitting testament to a great art historian and collector," he added.
Thomas de Maiziere also proposes deporting criminals more quickly and relaxing doctor confidentiality rules. He is due to announce some ideas on Thursday, and back some ideas from ministers in his party next week. There have been repeated attacks in German cities recently, some of them related to Islamist terror. In July, an axe-wielding teenager from Afghanistan injured five people on a train in Wuerzburg before he was shot dead by police. The same month, a failed asylum seeker from Syria killed himself and injured 15 people when he set off a bomb outside a music festival in Ansbach. Both attacks were claimed by the so-called Islamic State group. What is going on in Germany? The Islamic veil across Europe German press concern at spate of violence What drives individuals to commit mass killings? The burka is a strict Muslim veil for women that covers the full head and body. Not many people in Germany wear it. The country has very few restrictions on people's dress. A committee of the government issued a report in 2012 saying it would be unconstitutional to ban the full burka or the niqab facial veil. But there are some exceptions. For instance, it is illegal to cover your face in a football stadium in Germany. Burka bans exist in other parts of Europe, notably France, Belgium and some towns in Italy. Patient confidentiality In Germany, doctors who breach patient confidentiality can face up to a year in prison or be forced to pay a fine. But under Mr de Maiziere's proposed changes, they would have to inform the authorities if they became suspicious that a patient was planning to harm other people. The proposals have drawn sharp criticism from across the political left and from doctors. Frank Ulrich Montgomery, the head of the German Medical Association, said: "Patient confidentiality protects patients' privacy and is a basic right under the constitution. "The tense domestic security situation must not tempt us into rash political and legal measures.'' On Thursday, Mr de Maiziere is expected to announce the plans for speeding up the deportation process, making being a "threat to public security" grounds for deporting migrants, and relaxing doctors' confidentiality obligations. Next week, he is expected to back a series of measures being considered by a grouping of German states' interior ministers from within his own Christian Democrat party and its Bavarian sister party. The ministers propose: German law requires non-EU citizens to give up their existing nationality when applying for German citizenship. Mr de Maiziere says the terror threat to Germany is high. "We live in difficult times," he said on Wednesday. Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, a fellow Christian Democrat, has previously said information sharing should be ramped up in the wake of the attacks on Germany this summer.
By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent The study, based on 40 years of data on a range of measures, says governments are failing to address the crisis. Without deep and lasting changes, the world is facing "untold human suffering" the study says. The researchers say they have a moral obligation to warn of the scale of the threat. Released on the day that satellite data shows that last month was the warmest October on record, the new study says that simply measuring global surface temperatures is an inadequate way of capturing the real dangers of an overheating world. So the authors include a range of data which they believe represents a "suite of graphical vital signs of climate change over the past 40 years". These indicators include the growth of human and animal populations, per capita meat production, global tree cover loss, as well as fossil fuel consumption. Some progress has been seen in some areas. For example, renewable energy has grown significantly, with consumption of wind and solar increasing 373% per decade - but it was still 28 times smaller than fossil fuel use in 2018. Taken together, the researchers say most of their vital signs indicators are going in the wrong direction and add up to a climate emergency. "An emergency means that if we do not act or respond to the impacts of climate change by reducing our carbon emissions, reducing our livestock production, reducing our land clearing and fossil fuel consumption, the impacts will likely be more severe than we've experienced to date," said lead author Dr Thomas Newsome, from the University of Sydney. "That could mean there are areas on Earth that are not inhabitable by people." How does this differ from other reports on climate change? The study echoes many of the warnings that have been reported by scientists including the IPCC. The authors set out to present a clear and simple graphical picture of a broader ranger of indicators that can drive home to the public and to governments that the threat is serious while the response has been poor. Where it differs is in showing that while things might be bad, they are not hopeless. The researchers show six areas in which immediate steps should be taken that could make a major difference. These are: Energy: Politicians should impose carbon fees high enough to discourage the use of fossil fuels, they should end subsidies to fossil fuel companies and implement massive conservation practices while also replacing oil and gas with renewables. Short-lived pollutants: These include methane, hydrofluorocarbons and soot - the researchers say that limiting these has the potential to cut the short-term warming trend by 50% over the next few decades. Nature: Stop land clearing, restore forests, grasslands and mangroves which would all help to sequester CO2. Food: A big dietary shift is needed say researchers so that people eat mostly plants and consumer fewer animal products. Reducing food waste is also seen as critical. Economy: Convert the economy's reliance on carbon fuels - and change away from growing the world's gross domestic product and pursuing affluence. Population: The world needs to stabilise the global population which is growing by around 200,000 a day. So who are the scientists who have endorsed the report? Some 11,000 researchers of all types and varieties from 153 countries have endorsed the research The authors say they didn't target individuals so there is a marked lack of some of the bigger names in climate change research. All the details of who's signed the endorsement have been published online. "We have rising emissions, rising temperatures, and we've known this for 40 years and we haven't acted - you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know we have a a problem," said Dr Newsome. What do the authors want to happen now? The researchers are fed up because multiple climate conferences and assemblies have failed to produce meaningful action. However they believe that the growing, global protest movement offers hope. "We are encouraged by a recent global surge of concern - governments adopting new policies; schoolchildren striking; lawsuits proceeding; and grassroots citizen movements demanding change. "As scientists, we urge widespread use of the vital signs and hope the graphical indicators will better allow policymakers and the public to understand the magnitude of the crisis, realign priorities and track progress." So what about human population growth? The idea of trying to influence human population growth is highly controversial and has been deemed too hot to handle by UN negotiators. The authors say that looking the other way is no longer an option. "It is certainly a controversial topic - but I think that population should be talked about when considering human impacts on the Earth," said Dr Newsome. "It's important when presenting these results to look at some positives, and one of the more positive things that we've pulled out of this data is that there is now a slight decline in birth rates at a global level."

Panorama has seen accounts from 106,000 clients in 203 countries, leaked by whistleblower Herve Falciani in 2007. The documents include details of almost 7,000 clients based in the UK. HSBC admitted that it was "accountable for past control failures." But it said it has now "fundamentally changed". "We acknowledge that the compliance culture and standards of due diligence in HSBC's Swiss private bank, as well as the industry in general, were significantly lower than they are today," it added. The bank now faces criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina, but not in the UK, where HSBC is based. HSBC said it is "co-operating with relevant authorities". Treasury minister David Gauke defended the government's actions on tax avoidance in the House of Commons after Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood Shabana Mahmood tabled an urgent question. He insisted that the Treasury approach has been "very successful", saying it has sought prosecution for "serial tax evaders" and raised extra tax revenue. Offshore accounts are not illegal, but many people use them to hide cash from the tax authorities. And while tax avoidance is perfectly legal, deliberately hiding money to evade tax is not. The French authorities concluded in 2013 that 99.8% of their citizens on the list were probably evading tax. Joint investigation The thousands of pages of data were obtained by the French newspaper Le Monde. In a joint investigation, the documents have now been passed to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, the Guardian newspaper, Panorama and more than 50 media outlets around the world. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) was given the leaked data in 2010 and has identified 1,100 people from the list of 7,000 British clients who had not paid their taxes. But almost five years later, only one tax evader has been prosecuted. HMRC said £135m in tax, interest and penalties have now been paid by those who hid their assets in Switzerland. But the chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, Margaret Hodge MP, said: "I just don't think the tax authorities have been strong enough, assertive enough, brave enough, tough enough in securing for the British taxpayer the monies that are due." HSBC did not just turn a blind eye to tax evaders - in some cases it broke the law by actively helping its clients. The bank gave one wealthy family a foreign credit card so they could withdraw their undeclared cash at cashpoints overseas. HSBC also helped its tax-dodging clients stay ahead of the law. When the European Savings Directive was introduced in 2005, the idea was that Swiss banks would take any tax owed from undeclared accounts and pass it to the taxman. It was a tax designed to catch tax evaders. But instead of simply collecting the money, HSBC wrote to customers and offered them ways to get round the new tax. HSBC denies that all these account holders were evading tax. 'Dodge liabilities' Richard Brooks, a former tax inspector and author of The Great Tax Robbery, said: "I think they were a tax avoidance and tax evasion service. I think that's what they were offering. They knew full well that people come to them to dodge their tax liabilities." The man in charge of HSBC at the time, Stephen Green, was made a Conservative peer and appointed to the government. Lord Green was made a minister eight months after HMRC had been given the leaked documents from his bank. He served as a minister of trade and investment until 2013. He told Panorama: "As a matter of principle I will not comment on the business of HSBC past or present." HSBC's Swiss accounts in numbers 106,000 clients with Swiss bank accounts 203 countries involved $118bn total assets held in Swiss accounts 11,235 clients from Switzerland held $31.2bn 9,187 clients from France held $12.5bn 7,000 clients from UK held $21.7bn Treasury minister David Gauke defended Lord Green's appointment on BBC's Radio 4. "I am not aware of any evidence that suggests that Lord Green was involved in this sort of activity", but said he did not know whether anyone asked him about HSBC prior to his government appointment. But Ms Hodge said: "Either he didn't know and he was asleep at the wheel, or he did know and he was therefore involved in dodgy tax practices. "Either way he was the man in charge and I think he has got really important questions to answer." Verbal messages Meanwhile, HSBC said it has completely overhauled its private banking business and has reduced the number of Swiss accounts by almost 70% since 2007. In a statement, the bank said: "HSBC has implemented numerous initiatives designed to prevent its banking services being used to evade taxes or launder money." The bank said it now puts compliance and tax transparency ahead of profitability. But Panorama has spoken to a whistleblower who said there were still problems with tax dodging at HSBC private bank when she worked there in 2013. Sue Shelley was the private bank's head of compliance in Luxembourg. She said HSBC did not keep its promise to change. "I think the verbal messages were great but they weren't put into practice and that disturbed me greatly," she said. It was her job to make sure HSBC followed the rules, but she said she was sacked after raising concerns. She has since won a tribunal hearing for unfair dismissal.

What was the hacking trial? Allegations that News International journalists were involved in hacking people's phones for information led to the closure of the 168-year-old News of the World tabloid in 2011 and a trial costing reportedly up to £100m. The scandal went to the heart of Downing Street. Among those in the dock at London's Old Bailey for the eight-month trial were a close family friend of the prime minister and Coulson, David Cameron's official spokesman. It was some nine years ago that the News of the World published a story about Prince William's treatment for an injury, based on information that it could only have come by because one of its journalists had listened to the prince's voicemails. The ensuing police investigation, which uncovered "a vast number" of other victims, would begin the saga that led to the conviction of Coulson, the closure of a newspaper bought by millions every week and moves to change the way newspapers are regulated. What is phone hacking? Phone hacking was a technique used to listen to people's mobile voicemail. Reporters and a private investigator working for the News of the World used it to target people in the news - celebrities, politicians and crime victims - so they could find angles on stories that would get them ahead of the competition. They would listen to private messages left on voicemail, make a recording of them, and use the information to help write stories. Why did this trial come about? The News of the World was closed down in 2011 after its owners, Rupert Murdoch's News International, admitted the scale of hacking that had been going on, dating back many years. The company had battled against growing allegations for two years - one of its private investigators and the News of the World's royal editor were jailed in 2007 over a story gleaned from hacking. The paper's original position - that rogue staff had acted alone - could not stand. Eventually Rupert Murdoch decided he had no choice but to close the newspaper down after it emerged Milly Dowler, a teenager who was abducted and murdered, had her voicemails hacked. The Crown Prosecution Service charged two former editors - Rebekah Brooks and her successor Andy Coulson with conspiracy to intercept mobile voicemails alongside others connected to the newspaper. Who was on trial? Alongside Rebekah Brooks and Coulson was former managing editor Stuart Kuttner. Five others had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to hack phones before the trial began: private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, news editors James Weatherup and Greg Miskiw and reporters Neville Thurlbeck and Dan Evans. Mulcaire performed thousands of hacks for the newspaper under the instruction of news editors. The newspaper's former royal editor Clive Goodman was also charged with illegal payments to public officials - as was Rebekah Brooks and Coulson. Brooks' husband Charlie Brooks, her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter and News International's head of security Mark Hanna were accused of a conspiracy to hide material from the police. Mrs Brooks, Charlie Brooks, Cheryl Carter, Mr Kuttner and Mr Hanna were cleared of all charges against them. The jury was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on charges that Coulson and Goodman conspired to commit misconduct in a public office by paying police officers for two royal directories. How did hacking come to light? Glenn Mulcaire and Clive Goodman were jailed seven years ago after pleading guilty to intercepting voicemails - but that first trial only concerned a small number of cases. Police did not go through all the evidence seized from Mulcaire. Two years later it emerged that News International had agreed a series of confidential out-of-court settlements which had prevented more allegations being aired. How did the newspaper carry out hacking? Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire would be "tasked" to target a particular mobile phone number to acquire voicemails and report back to the news desk. Mulcaire kept detailed notes of each operation that he carried out, including the target and who had commissioned him. At one point he was being paid £100,000 a year. Prosecutors sought to prove that Rebekah Brooks and Coulson were part of this conspiracy because they must have known how stories were being acquired and who was being paid. Rebekah Brooks was acquitted of all charges.
By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent Researchers believe we could soon cross a threshold leading to boiling hot temperatures and towering seas in the centuries to come. Even if countries succeed in meeting their CO2 targets, we could still lurch on to this "irreversible pathway". Their study shows it could happen if global temperatures rise by 2C. An international team of climate researchers, writing in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, says the warming expected in the next few decades could turn some of the Earth's natural forces - that currently protect us - into our enemies. Each year the Earth's forests, oceans and land soak up about 4.5 billion tonnes of carbon that would otherwise end up in our atmosphere adding to temperatures. But as the world experiences warming, these carbon sinks could become sources of carbon and make the problems of climate change significantly worse. So whether it is the permafrost in northern latitudes that now holds millions of tonnes of warming gases, or the Amazon rainforest, the fear is that the closer we get to 2 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels, the greater the chances that these natural allies will spew out more carbon than they currently now take in. Back in 2015, governments of the world committed themselves to keeping temperature rises well below 2 degrees, and to strive to keep them under 1.5. According to the authors, the current plans to cut carbon may not be enough if their analysis is correct. "What we are saying is that when we reach 2 degrees of warming, we may be at a point where we hand over the control mechanism to Planet Earth herself," co-author Prof Johan Rockström, from the Stockholm Resilience Centre, told BBC News. "We are the ones in control right now, but once we go past 2 degrees, we see that the Earth system tips over from being a friend to a foe. We totally hand over our fate to an Earth system that starts rolling out of equilibrium." Currently, global temperatures have risen about 1 degree above pre-industrial levels and they are rising by around 0.17C per decade. In their new study the authors looked at 10 natural systems, which they term "feedback processes". Right now, these help humanity to avoid the worst impacts of carbon and temperature rises, and include forests, Arctic sea-ice, and methane hydrates on the ocean floor. The worry is that if one of these systems tips over and starts pushing large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, the rest could follow like a row of dominoes. What exactly is a Hothouse Earth scenario? In short, it's not good. According to the research paper, crossing into a Hothouse Earth period would see a higher global temperature than at any time in the past 1.2 million years. The climate might stabilise with 4-5 degrees C of warming above the pre-industrial age. Thanks to the melting of ice sheets, the seas could be 10-60 metres higher than now. Essentially, this would mean that some parts of the Earth would become uninhabitable. The impacts would be "massive, sometimes abrupt and undoubtedly disruptive," say the authors. The only upside, if you can call it that, is that the worst impacts may not be felt for a century or two. The downside is that we wouldn't really be able to do anything about it, once it starts. Are the current heatwaves in the UK and Europe evidence of a Hothouse Earth? The authors say the extreme weather events we are seeing right now around the world cannot be immediately associated with the risk of passing 2 degrees C. However, they argue that it may be evidence that the Earth is more sensitive to warming than previously thought. "One should learn from these extreme events and take these as a piece of evidence that we should be even more cautious," said Prof Rockström. "It may support the conclusion that if this can happen at one degree, then we should at least not be surprised or too dismissive of conclusions that things can happen more abruptly than we previously thought." Surely we've known about these risks before? What these authors are saying is that up to now, we've underestimated the power and sensitivity of natural systems. People have been thinking that climate change would be a global emergency for everyone if temperatures rose 3-4 degrees by the end of this century. But this paper argues that beyond 2 degrees, there is a significant risk of turning natural systems - that presently help keep temperatures down - into massive sources of carbon that would put us on an "irreversible pathway" to a world that is 4-5 degrees warmer than before the industrial revolution. Any good news here at all? Surprisingly, yes! We can avoid the hothouse scenario but it's going to take a fundamental re-adjustment of our relationship with the planet. "Climate and other global changes show us that we humans are impacting the Earth system at the global level. This means that we as a global community can also manage our relationship with the system to influence future planetary conditions. "This study identifies some of the levers that can be used to do so," says co-author Katherine Richardson from the University of Copenhagen. So not only are we going to have to stop burning fossil fuels by the middle of this century, we are going to have to get very busy with planting trees, protecting forests, working out how to block the Sun's rays and developing machines to suck carbon out of the air. The authors say a total re-orientation of human values, equity, behaviour and technologies is required. We must all become stewards of the Earth. What do other scientists say? Some say the authors of this paper are too extreme. Many others say their conclusions are sound. "As a result of human impacts on climate, the new paper argues that we've gone beyond any chance of the Earth cooling 'of its own accord'," said Dr Phil Williamson from the University of East Anglia, UK. "Together these effects could add an extra half a degree Celsius by the end of the century to the warming that we are directly responsible for ‒ thereby crossing thresholds and tipping points that seem likely to occur around 2 degrees C, and committing the planet to irreversible further change, as Hothouse Earth." Others are concerned that the authors' faith in humanity to grasp the serious nature of the problem is misplaced. "Given the evidence of human history, this would seem a naive hope," said Prof Chris Rapley, from University College London. "At a time of the widespread rise of right-wing populism, with its associated rejection of the messages of those perceived as 'cosmopolitan elites' and specific denial of climate change as an issue, the likelihood that the combination of factors necessary to allow humanity to navigate the planet to an acceptable 'intermediate state' must surely be close to zero."
By Paul Harrison and Kerry AllenBBC News Tang Shuai was simply trying to improve legal knowledge among the deaf community when he posted the video on China's WeChat messaging app in February. It was an instant hit. Mr Tang was flooded with so many friend requests that he had to ask WeChat to boost the friend limit from 5,000 to 10,000. So why did it strike such a chord? The answer goes way beyond legal difficulties and into the complex world of sign language in China. Language barriers There are two types of sign language in the country. Chinese Sign Language (CSL) is taught in schools and used by most interpreters and instructors. It is the standardised version of the language, tied closely to the written language. But day-to-day, many deaf people also use natural sign language. The language has grown and evolved over time, and changes from region to region. This has led to misunderstandings in courtrooms - and some dire consequences for deaf people - which Mr Tang is well placed to understand. He was born to deaf parents in Chongqing in south-west China, and can understand both forms of sign language. But he tells the BBC that his parents were initially hesitant about him learning. "My parents didn't like me studying sign language at first," Mr Tang says. "I had no choice but to quietly sneak into my parents' factory, to learn with the deaf ladies and gentlemen there," explaining that many of the workers were deaf themselves. He picked up more skills by visiting the popular Chaotianmen tourist area. "Many deaf people from outside of the city come there. It was possible for me to learn many different versions of sign language," he says. Lost in translation Before becoming a lawyer, Mr Tang worked for six years as a sign language interpreter in Chinese courts. He studied law after realising many deaf people knew little about their legal rights. He tells of one notable case, where he defended a man suspected of theft. "When I went to the city detention centre to meet [my client] I used natural sign language. He was surprised to see that I could communicate with him...then he told me, 'I can't understand much of the sign language used by the [police] interpreters'." Mr Tang said additional sign language lawyers were brought in to assess mistakes in the translation of evidence given earlier in the case, and the court ruled his client was innocent of one of the original charges. After the case, the judge told Mr Tang the case highlighted the "many problems, where deaf people are involved, in the translation of sign language." You might also like: Defending the voiceless Mr Tang wanted to do more to help the deaf community. Despite a significant expansion in access to education, some deaf Chinese are still targeted by financial scam organisers. Stories of deaf people who lost fortunes in scams prompted Mr Tang to launch the video series that shot him to social media fame. Financial scams are thriving in many parts of China as organisers target vulnerable communities with the promise of employment or lucrative returns for direct sales. Victims are promised rewards if they recruit more investors into the operation. The schemes operate by attracting new investors, with some of the funds paid back to early joiners. Experts say the Chinese schemes are different to Western versions due to the lack of sophistication of the investors involved. Mr Tang outlined the pitfalls of Ponzi schemes by telling the story of a wolf that cheats rabbits by promising to give them high returns on their investments - for every 10 carrots they invested each month, he would give them four carrots as profit. When word got out, more rabbits would give their carrots to the wolf but in the end, the wolf conned them all by running away with their carrots. Mr Tang's video was praised not only by deaf people in China, but netizens and even the national media. He became an online celebrity almost overnight, with many outlets dubbing him the spokesperson for "those in the world that are voiceless". Now he uses his expertise to promote legal awareness among the deaf community, alongside his full-time job as a lawyer. He set up a public WeChat account for his video series to provide education on key legal issues. He also set up a legal welfare service to give face-to-face consultations using video calls. After being inundated with requests for legal assistance - and because of the lack of signing lawyers in China - he started training sessions for deaf people who want to forge a career in law. According to media reports, Mr Tang has hired five deaf graduates from a local university and is training them to provide legal guidance to deaf people. Deaf people aren't the only ones empowered by his videos. Mr Tang has inspired thousands of hearing people, with many saying they now want to learn sign language. "I hope that sign language can be as important as a foreign language in our national education system," one Weibo user says.
The foreign ministry spokesman accused the countries of "gross interference in China's internal affairs". New Zealand made the same move after the other three. China said it reserved the right to respond to this too. The law reduces the city's autonomy and makes it easier to punish protesters. "Judicial co-operation has been politically manipulated by Canada, Australia and the UK - a wrong move that damages the conditions for such co-operation and deviates from its purpose of upholding justice and the rule of law," foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said. "Therefore China has decided that the Hong Kong special administrative region will suspend its agreements of surrendering fugitive offenders and of mutual assistance in criminal matters with Canada, Australia and the UK." The three countries, along with New Zealand and the US, are part of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence alliance. The US has signalled it plans to suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong. The US has decided to rescind Hong Kong's special trading privileges after the new law was enacted. Earlier this month US lawmakers approved sanctions in response to the law, targeting banks that do business with Chinese officials involved in cracking down on pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. Hong Kong's government says the widely criticised law is required to bring order to a city that saw mass pro-democracy protests last year which often turned violent. Announcing New Zealand's move earlier on Tuesday, Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said China had "eroded rule-of-law principles, undermined the 'one country, two systems' framework that underpins Hong Kong's unique status, and gone against commitments China made to the international community". Travel advice has also been updated to alert New Zealanders to risks presented by the law. Military and dual-use goods and technology exports from New Zealand to Hong Kong will now be treated in the same way as New Zealand treats such exports to China. Canada and Australia said they were suspending their extradition treaties with Hong Kong in early July. The UK announced its decision last week. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the "imposition" of the new security law in Hong Kong by Beijing was a "serious violation" of the country's international obligations. The UK and others fear the new arrangement could see anyone extradited to Hong Kong from their territory being subsequently sent on to China. Beijing introduced the security law at the end of June, creating new offences which could see Hong Kong residents sent to mainland China for trial. Critics said it could see pro-democracy protesters in the region being served with life sentences. They have also said the law breaches an agreement made with the UK before Hong Kong - a former British colony - was handed over to China in 1997. Under the 50-year agreement, China enshrined civil liberties - including the right to protest, freedom of speech and the independence of the judiciary - in Hong Kong's Basic Law, an approach which came to be known as "one country, two systems".
Authorities say some 7,000 people live in the camp in squalid conditions. They will be offered placements in refugee centres across the country. Several of the children there are expected to be relocated to the UK. The Jungle has become a powerful symbol of Europe's failure to cope with the migrant crisis. Many of the migrants attempt to reach the UK by boarding lorries as they approach ports or the Channel Tunnel. Minors will be taken to the camp's converted shipping containers during the dismantling of the rest of the Jungle, the interior ministry said in a statement. The migrants who currently live in the containers - which were being used as temporary accommodation instead of makeshift tents - will be evacuated to make room for the minors. There are 7,500 beds available in centres across France for the Calais migrants. Some 60 buses will be used to remove them from the camp. Officials say they are worried about crowds rushing to leave the camp during the first stage of the operation. From Tuesday, heavy machinery will be sent to clear the tents and shelters that have been left behind. The Interior Ministry said that police forces "might be forced to intervene" if faced with resistance. What is the 'Jungle'? Several children from the camp are expected to be relocated to the UK. French Interior Ministry Bernard Cazeneuve had held talks on this issue with the UK's Home Secretary Amber Rudd, the statement added. Discussions, it said, "were sometimes difficult as they can be between close partners". The Jungle has played host to scenes of both squalor and of violence, as migrants, mainly from Africa and the Middle East, attempt to board lorries bound for the UK, clashing with drivers and police in the process. A UK-funded wall 1km (0.6 miles) long is being built along the main road to the port in an attempt to deter would-be stowaways. The UK government has not confirmed the cost, but it is reported to have contributed about £1.9m (€2.2m). Work on the wall, which began last week, is due to be finished by the end of the year.
By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Mumsnet - which says it has 1.5 million registered members - said that it believed that the cyber thieves may have obtained passwords and personal messages before it patched its site. The Canada Revenue Agency said that 900 people's social insurance numbers had been stolen. These are the first confirmed losses. The Mumsnet site's founder Justine Roberts told the BBC that it became apparent that user data was at risk when her own username and password were used to post a message online. She said the hackers then informed Mumsnet's administrators that the attack was linked to the Heartbleed flaw and told them the company's data was not safe. "On Friday 11 April, it became apparent that what is widely known as the Heartbleed bug had been used to access data from Mumsnet users' accounts," the London-based website added in an email to its members. "We have no way of knowing which Mumsnetters were affected by this. "The worst case scenario is that the data of every Mumsnet user account was accessed. "It is possible that this information could then have been used to log in as you and give access to your posting history, your personal messages and your personal profile, although we should say that we have seen no evidence of anyone's account being used for anything other than to flag up the security breach, thus far." The site added that it was forcing its members to reset any password created on or before Saturday. Canada's tax agency was one of the first major organisations to cut services as a result of the flaw in OpenSSL - a cryptographic software library used by services to keep data transmissions private. However, its action last Tuesday appears to have come too late. "Regrettably, the CRA has been notified by the Government of Canada's lead security agencies of a malicious breach of taxpayer data that occurred over a six-hour period," the agency said on a message posted to its homepage. "Based on our analysis to date, social insurance numbers (Sin) of approximately 900 taxpayers were removed from CRA systems by someone exploiting the Heartbleed vulnerability." "We are currently going through the painstaking process of analysing other fragments of data, some that may relate to businesses, that were also removed." Heartbleed flaw The Heartbleed bug was made public a week ago by Google and Codenomicon, a small Finnish security firm, which independently identified the problem. OpenSSL is used to digitally scramble data as it passes between a user's device and an online service in order to prevent others eavesdropping on the information. It is used by many, but not all, sites that show a little padlock and use a web address beginning "https". The researchers discovered that because of a coding mishap hackers could theoretically access 64 kilobytes of unencrypted data from the working memory of systems using vulnerable versions of OpenSSL. Although that is a relatively small amount, the attackers can repeat the process to increase their haul. 'Dangerous' advice Mumsnet has been criticised for one aspect of its handling of the breach - its email to members contains an inline link that it suggests they click to reset their passwords. However, UK police had previously warned members of the public to beware of unsolicited email asking them to click links "even if they are from companies you are familiar with". This is because fraudsters are taking advantage of Heartbleed to mount phishing attacks in which users are directed to spoof sites designed to steal their credentials. "It is dangerous," Dr Steven Murdoch, a computer security researcher at the University of Cambridge told the BBC. "Probably what [Mumsnet] should have done is sent out an email saying 'go to our website using the normal address [to reset the password]'. "If people receive an email they have not asked for they should be suspicious." By contrast Canada's tax agency said it would not call or email the individuals it believed to be affected by its breach in order to avoid giving criminals a chance to exploit the situation. Instead it said it would send out registered letters. "I believe we'll see many more of these announcements over the coming days," Keith Bird, UK managing director of internet security firm Check Point said. "However, people should double-check that the website or service they use is actually advising them to choose a new password before making any changes to their settings. "This way, they can be sure the website has updated its security, and that they're not running the risk of exposing a new password. And if a service does recommend changing passwords, don't choose one that you already use for other websites."
His spokesman says Khodorkovsky and his wife travelled by train to Basel from Germany to accompany their two sons who are returning to their Swiss school. Khodorkovsky flew to Germany after his release on 20 December. He served 10 years in jail for fraud and tax evasion, but insists that his conviction was politically motivated. While travelling to Basel on Sunday, Khodorkovsky told Swiss TV he wanted to campaign for the release of prisoners. "You can't remain quiet when you know that political prisoners languish in jail," he said. "I think campaigning for the release of those who have been jailed without justification is the job of every ordinary citizen. As far as I'm concerned, it has nothing to do with politics," he added. Khodorkovsky has not yet decided whether he wants to stay permanently in Switzerland, his spokesman said. The businessman made his fortune from the controversial privatisation of Soviet state assets. In 1995, he acquired oil giant Yukos. After President Vladimir Putin came to power Khodorkovsky made no secret of his support for the liberal opposition, In 2005 he received an eight-year jail sentence for tax evasion, fraud and embezzlement. Two years before his release date he was convicted again on further charges of embezzlement and money laundering. He had been due to be released next August, but requested a pardon because his mother is suffering from cancer. The pardon came after Russian MPs backed a wide-ranging amnesty for at least 20,000 prisoners. Two members of punk protest band Pussy Riot - jailed for staging a protest in a cathedral - have also recently been freed. Analysts say Mr Putin may have been trying to dampen international criticism of Russia's human rights record ahead of February's Winter Olympics in Sochi.
"It is now time to open Texas 100%," the Republican said on Tuesday. Texas is the largest US state to end its mask mandate. Mr Abbott has faced criticism from his party over the measure, which was imposed last July. But the administration of US President Joe Biden has made it clear coronavirus restrictions are still necessary. The announcement in Texas came as similar rules were lifted in other states, including Michigan, Louisiana, and Mississippi, which also ended its mask mandate. The roll-out of vaccinations against Covid-19 has boosted confidence in a return to pre-pandemic life in the US. On Tuesday, President Biden said the US was on track to have enough vaccines for every adult in the country by the end of May. Yet the wave of reopenings has put states at odds with the Biden administration and its senior health officials, who have reacted with dismay to the relaxation of coronavirus measures at a precarious time in the pandemic. On Monday the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned of a "potential fourth surge of cases" if the country lapsed into complacency. Covid-19 data shows that, while infections and deaths have declined in recent weeks, they are still at high levels relative to other countries. In total, the US has recorded more than 28 million infections and 516,000 deaths related to Covid-19, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. What did the Texas governor announce? Mr Abbott issued an executive order that rescinded most of the coronavirus measures he imposed earlier in the pandemic. The new executive order, which is to take effect on 10 March, lifts all mask requirements and forbids local authorities from penalising residents who do not wear a face covering. It removes all restrictions on businesses in counties without a high number of Covid-19 patients in hospital. "Too many Texans have been sidelined from employment opportunities," Mr Abbott said in a speech at the Chamber of Commerce in the city of Lubbock. "Too many small business owners have struggled to pay their bills. This must end." He said that with increased vaccinations and improved treatment for Covid-19, the state was "in a far better position now". But, he added, "Covid has not suddenly disappeared". Following weeks of decline, coronavirus infections and related deaths are creeping up again in Texas, data from the Covid Tracking Project showed. Texas has recorded more than 43,000 deaths related to Covid-19, the third-highest state toll in the US. Texas puts White House relations to the test Angelica Casas, reporting from San Antonio, Texas Governor Abbott's announcement was no surprise to Texans. After all, the state's pandemic response has been political from the start. The state's Republican leadership favoured former President Donald Trump's relatively relaxed approach to imposing restrictions. But that created tension with local officials in the state's major cities, which all lean Democrat. It was control of the disease vs control of the economy. Mask requirements vs maintaining personal liberties. And when the surges came, state politicians were more reactive than proactive. A year later, not much has changed. The state's death toll and current case rate are still among the highest in the US. That's why critics say Governor Abbott's decision does not follow the science. So the decision will be a test to the state - but also to Mr Abbott's relationship with President Biden, who has addressed the pandemic with more urgency than his predecessor. What about other US states? Individual states are in charge of public health policy in the US. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, most introduced restrictions on businesses and travel. About 35 required face coverings to be worn in public places - either indoors or outdoors - although enforcement of these mask mandates has been patchy. With cases and deaths falling sharply in recent weeks, several states have begun easing the restrictions. Shortly after Mr Abbott's announcement, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves said he would do the same in an even shorter time frame. "Starting tomorrow, we are lifting all of our county mask mandates and businesses will be able to operate at full capacity without any state-imposed rules," Mr Reeves said. Health experts have warned that the pandemic was far from over and cases could pick up if curbs were lifted too soon. President Biden - in contrast with his predecessor Mr Trump - has made fighting the virus a priority for his administration. On Tuesday, Mr Biden said he was upbeat about reaching his goal of delivering 100 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office, but urged Americans to remain vigilant in wearing masks and observing social distancing. "Today's announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic," Biden said in a televised statement from the White House. "But I have to be honest with you. This fight is far from over." How has Covid affected the US?
He calls it "disrespecting the flag" but supporters of the protest believe the players are exercising their right to free speech. But there is a breach of etiquette here enshrined in law. The Flag Code covers all aspects of etiquette in relation to the Stars and Stripes, including how to behave when the anthem is played. The code is never enforced, however, and there is no punishment for breaching it. So what should you do when the national anthem is played? The code states that persons present are expected to stand and face the flag, if there is one. Civilians should stand to attention with right hand over heart, while military personnel in uniform and veterans should salute throughout. A recent amendment to the code said that military personnel out of uniform could also salute. President Barack Obama famously neglected to put his hand over his heart during the 2008 election campaign. He explained his mistake by saying his grandfather taught him to do this only during the pledge, and to only sing during the anthem. On the balcony of the White House, President Trump needed a prompt from his wife Melania when he forgot to put his hand on his chest. The Star-Spangled Banner - first verse Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? Men not in uniform should remove any headdress with their right hand and hold it at their left shoulder, the code states. This is generally observed at sporting events. NFL players may not put on their helmets until after the anthem is played. The Flag Code makes no mention of whether the anthem should be sung by those present. However, singing the Star-Spangled Banner is encouraged from school onwards - in some schools it is compulsory. In 1942 the National Anthem Committee wrote that "it is of paramount importance that emphasis be placed upon the singing of the National Anthem". What should you avoid doing with the flag? Numerous manufacturers of flag merchandise could be in trouble here. The Flag Code states that it should not be used for any advertising purpose, and should not be embroidered or printed on any material for temporary use. It should also never be part of a costume or sports uniform, or used as "wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery". Olympic medal winners who celebrate their success by covering themselves in the flag should take note. Also, the flag should never be displayed upside down, except as a symbol of "dire distress". Is it illegal to burn the US flag? Protesters throughout the world frequently set alight US flags to demonstrate their hatred of America, but you would not face prosecution for doing so in the US itself. In 1990 the Supreme Court invalidated a federal law against desecration of the flag on the grounds that it was in violation of the First Amendment on freedom of speech. In fact, burning the flag is sometimes even encouraged. The Flag Code says that no disrespect should be shown to it, but also allows for any flag which is not fit for display to be "destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning". How long has the Flag Code been around? Experts say that US flag etiquette is important because was created out of respect for the country's historical heritage. But the code was first drawn up only in 1923 under the auspices of the American Legion, and only became law when the US was at war, in 1942.
The American singer was awarded the prize in October but failed to travel to pick up the award, or deliver the lecture that is required to receive the 8m kroner ($900,000;£727,000) prize. The academy said it would meet Dylan, 75, in private in the Swedish capital, where he is giving two concerts. He will not lecture in person but is expected to send a taped version. If he does not deliver a lecture by June, he will have to forfeit the prize money. A blog entry from Prof Sara Danius, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, said: "The good news is that the Swedish Academy and Bob Dylan have decided to meet this weekend. "The Academy will then hand over Dylan's Nobel diploma and the Nobel medal, and congratulate him on the Nobel Prize in Literature. "The setting will be small and intimate, and no media will be present; only Bob Dylan and members of the Academy will attend, all according to Dylan's wishes." Prof Darius said taped lectures had been sent by other winners in the past, including Alice Munro in 2013. Earlier this week, Prof Darius said the academy had had no phone conversations with Dylan and that he had until 10 June to perform the lecture in order to receive the money. "What he decides to do is his own business," she had said. In October, Bob Dylan became the first songwriter to win the prestigious award, and the first American since novelist Toni Morrison in 1993. He received the prize "for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition", the award citation said. It took him more than two weeks to make any public comment, finally saying the honour had left him "speechless". He then snubbed the Nobel ceremony in December because of "pre-existing commitments". But in a speech read out on his behalf, he said he had thought his odds of winning were as likely as him "standing on the moon". He said it was "truly beyond words" to receive the prize.
Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News@gordoncoreraon Twitter UK officials believe it is not possible to be absolutely sure about the origins but point to scientific opinion suggesting the most likely scenario is that it was from a live animal market. However, they add that it is impossible to rule out the theory of an accidental release from a lab without a full investigation. Their view echoes comments on Tuesday by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who said: "We can't rule out any of these arrangements... but the most likely has been in a wildlife wet market." In the US, the intelligence community has also been more cautious in its public position than its political leaders and, last week, it issued a carefully worded statement. It said that it concurred with the "wide scientific consensus" that Covid-19 was not man-made or genetically modified. It then added it would "continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan". However, both President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have since pointed strongly towards the lab accident theory without providing any specific evidence. Mr Pompeo said the evidence was "enormous". It is possible that there could be lines of intelligence which could be used to support that theory, but they may not be confirmed or reflect the overall balance of evidence. Diplomatic balancing act US intelligence, like other countries, has devoted extensive resources to try and understand what has been happening within China, and some of the information could be highly sensitive. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told National Geographic on Monday that he did not entertain the lab theory. The World Health Organization (WHO) also says it has not received any evidence from the US to back up the lab theory. Intelligence may well point to China having tried to play down or hide details of the initial outbreak, although this is different from hiding the exact origin of the virus. However, it may well add to the confusion and suspicion. China so far does not appear willing to allow an international, transparent investigation despite growing calls for one. UK politicians and officials have been wary of speaking openly about their view of the virus origins, largely because of the risk of highlighting differences with Washington or getting into a diplomatic row with China - the latter is something the Trump administration is less concerned about, and may well positively welcome as an issue in an election year. On Monday, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he would not comment on intelligence information but added that China did have to answer questions about how quickly it had reported the outbreak, and needed to be "open and transparent" about what it learned. UK officials also say they are unaware of a "Five Eyes" report that was referenced over the weekend in Australian media - Five Eyes is the intelligence alliance consisting of the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. The media report talked of a 15-page document detailing China's covering up of the early stages of the outbreak.
By Owen AmosBBC News With one hand, Lu Yuejin carried a bucket and a bag of clothes. With the other, she held a duvet tight round her sick daughter. Hu Ping needed the duvet to stay warm: she had leukaemia. But more importantly, she needed to leave Hubei, her home province. The 26-year-old began chemotherapy in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei, in January. But the coronavirus outbreak - which emerged in Wuhan late last year - had overwhelmed the hospitals. On 28 January, the hospital told her there was no room: she had to go elsewhere. The family tried 10 other hospitals in Hubei, but none had a bed. Hu Ping lived near the border, so she and her mother tried to enter Jiangxi province. But then, on a bridge over the Yangtze river, they realised they were trapped. Wuhan was quarantined on 23 January, and the rest of Hubei soon followed. It was possible to leave for medical reasons, but Hu Ping did not have the right pass. They could not cross the bridge. When Lu Yuejin heard the news, she started to cry. "Please, take my daughter," she said. "I don't need to go past... please, just let my daughter go past." Nearby were two journalists from the Reuters agency - Martin Pollard and Thomas Peter. "My daughter needs to go to hospital in Jiujiang [the Jiangxi border city]," she told them. "She needs to have her treatment. But they won't let us through." As she spoke, the loudspeakers blared out a brutal reminder: Hubei residents, the message said, were not allowed into Jiangxi. "All I want to do," said Lu Yuejin, "is save her life." As Lu Yuejin begged and the speakers blared, Hu Ping sat on the floor, wrapped in her duvet. After an hour, an ambulance arrived on the other side of the checkpoint, and they were allowed in. Pollard and Peter filed their story, and the world - from the Japan Times to the Gulf News - saw Lu Yuejin's tears. But what happened next was unknown - until now. After seeing Reuters' story, the BBC tracked down Hu Ping's family and spoke to Shi Xiaodi - her fiancé. He tells us what happened at the border. "My mother-in-law cried for a long time, begging those police," he says. "The police came to ask for the reason in detail, and got to know that she [Hu Ping] was a severe leukaemia patient in need of treatment. "The police asked their boss for instructions. The boss understood the situation clearly, and called the ambulance." More stories from Wuhan Hu Ping was taken across the river to the Third People's Hospital of Jiujiang University Hospital. Finally - after all the calls, and all the visits - she was taken in. "She is now getting good treatment," says Shi. "Because she is young, she is recovering quite well." But their worries aren't over. The couple are not wealthy, and cancer treatment in China can be expensive (public health insurance doesn't usually cover the full cost of treatment). So, when she was diagnosed, Shi made a video: "Bride diagnosed leukaemia, we won't give up." They received tens of thousands of yuan in donations. "So many people tried to help us," he says - but it wasn't enough. Shi has spent his 100,000 yuan (£11,000; $14,000) life savings on his fiancé's treatment but, he says, the cost will be met "mainly by her family". "The family has no income now," he says. "Her parents are all farmers and can't go out to work [because of the virus]." Shi is not critical of the Chinese government, or the hospitals that turned away his fiancée. "The hospital, the doctors, the nurses - many, many of my classmates - they didn't get rest," he says. "Every day, every time, they are consistently working. They tried very hard." And he knows Hu Ping was lucky to find a bed across the border. "I heard from the news that one or two patients died because they can't get treated," he says. But he knows it will be some time until life gets back to normal. "Even if she gets good treatment, it will take at least two or three years [to be fully recovered]. And even if she comes back perfectly, it still has a chance to turn bad." Shi Xiaodi met Hu Ping eight years ago at university. They were in the same class - they both studied human resources - and have been together for three years. They were due to get married in January, but then Hu Ping was diagnosed, and the coronavirus swept the country, and everything turned upside down. As of Thursday, there had been 67,592 confirmed coronavirus cases in Hubei - with 49,797 in Wuhan alone. Almost 3,000 people have died in the province where Hu Ping and her mother were trying to leave. That's almost 90% of the global total. Shi, though, stresses the wedding is postponed - not cancelled. "We have the confidence to get through all this," he says. "And we will get married when she is better." The proudest guest, one imagines, will be the mother of the bride - this time crying tears of joy. Follow Owen on Twitter: @OwenAmos
She also called for boosting equal participation in "traditionally male-dominated sectors of our economy". Officials blamed the many empty seats in the hall on security restrictions. Ms Trump's father has been accused by multiple women of sexual harassment and assault, all of which his representatives have denied. Accusations of groping, forced kissing, and walking unannounced into changing areas at beauty pageants were made against Donald Trump when he was running for president. Past weeks have brought heightened focus on sexual harassment around the world, which was sparked by the accusations against Hollywood movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, continued in the #metoo movement where victims shared stories online, and has already claimed the job of a UK cabinet minister, Michael Fallon. When asked last week about the claims against Mr Trump, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said all the women who made accusations against Mr Trump were lying. At the World Assembly for Women in Tokyo, Ms Trump said: "All too often, our workplace culture fails to treat women with appropriate respect. "This takes many forms, including harassment, which can never be tolerated," she added. She urged the world should boost women participation in the so-called STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and maths. And she pointed out that men are not referred to as "working men" in the same way women are called "working women". "It is my hope that by the time my daughter Arabella grows into a woman, she will not be defined by whether she works inside or outside the home," she said. Her speech in Tokyo comes days before her father's first trip to Asia since taking office. A Washington post reporter at the event tweeted a picture of empty rows of seats. Reports said officials had blamed tight security restrictions, but there were no reports of long queues. Speaking at the same summit, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his government was also trying to bring more women into the workforce. "We've put our full strength into creating an environment where it's easy for women to work," Mr Abe said in his opening address. Despite these efforts, however, Japan's gender gap remains wide. The country ranked 114 out of 144 in the World Economic Forum's 2017 Global Gender Gap report, which was released as Ms Trump prepared to speak. Working as an adviser to her father, Ms Trump has made women's issues one of her key policy areas since joining the White House. Her trip to Japan is also to lay the groundwork for her father's trip, which begins in Japan on Sunday.
Last month the 83-year-old was awarded the 2018 Hans Christian Andersen Award, sometimes called the Little Nobel Prize for Literature. The jury described the "ineffable charm" of Ms Kadono's picture books and novels, deeply rooted in Japan. She was inspired to write her most famous series - Kiki's Delivery Service or Majo no Takkyubin in Japanese - after her young daughter drew a picture of a witch with musical notes flying around it. "I made Kiki around the same age as my daughter was at that time, just between childhood and adulthood," Ms Kadono said, according to the Asahi Shimbun. "It's all about this kid getting to fly with her own magic." Late bloomer Born in Tokyo, Ms Kadono was evacuated from her home at age ten and sent to northern Japan during World War Two. After the war was over, she attended university in Japan before emigrating to Brazil for a few years. Some of her works, including Forest of Tunnel and Brazil and My Friend Luizinho, were inspired by her wartime experiences and years in Brazil. The author describes herself as a "late bloomer", owing to the fact that she was 35 when her first book came out. "I was more a reader than a writer. [But] after trial and error, I realised I loved writing," she told Japanese media at a recent press conference. "I decided to write throughout my life, even if my works would not be published." She has published close to 200 original works, including picture books, stories for young adults and essay anthologies. But her most famous work is undoubtedly Kiki's Delivery Service. Silver screen Originally published in 1985, the story revolves around Kiki, a young witch who travels around on her broomstick with her black cat Jiji. The series starts with 13-year-old Kiki as she sets out on a year-long apprenticeship for witches in training, and follows her as she tries to find her place in the world despite various setbacks and struggles. The rest of the series chronicles Kiki as she grows into a young adult and eventually, a mother of two. Nearly 1.7 million copies of the books have been sold in Japan alone, and the series has been translated into nine languages. It was later adapted into a film by iconic director Hayao Miyazaki of Japanese animation house Studio Ghibli. The movie became one of Mr Miyazaki's most popular films. But what is it about the book that has made it so loved? "Kiki's Delivery Service makes children believe that everyone has [their] own magic," Tomoko Honobe, Ms Kadono's editor, told the BBC. "The raison d'etre of children's literature is giving strength of confidence to children, [enabling them] to become mature." And Ms Kadono seems to have some magic of her own. "She's just like a good witch, who has all these charms. She is mischievous, chatty, energetic and young," said Ms Honobe. "I have to work really hard to keep up with her energy." 'Words will be your strength' Last month Ms Kadono found out she had won the Hans Christian Andersen Award, given by the International Board on Books for Young People. The biennial award is presented to an author whose "complete works have made an important, lasting contribution to children's literature." "I had no idea I could have [such an award]," Ms Kadono said at the award reception. "It is such an honour... being read by many people, all over the world." Yet the acclaimed author says her stories do not belong to her, but rather, her readers. "The significance of storytelling is, once it is handed to readers, it becomes theirs," said Ms Kadono. "[And as] you read and read, you create your own dictionary in you. And those words will be your strength through your life." Reporting by the BBC's Sakiko Shiraishi and Yvette Tan
By Helen BriggsBBC News More mothers now need surgery to deliver a baby due to their narrow pelvis size, according to a study. Researchers estimate cases where the baby cannot fit down the birth canal have increased from 30 in 1,000 in the 1960s to 36 in 1,000 births today. Historically, these genes would not have been passed from mother to child as both would have died in labour. Researchers in Austria say the trend is likely to continue, but not to the extent that non-surgical births will become obsolete. Dr Philipp Mitteroecker, of the department of theoretical biology at the University of Vienna, said there was a long standing question in the understanding of human evolution. "Why is the rate of birth problems, in particular what we call fetopelvic disproportion - basically that the baby doesn't fit through the maternal birth canal - why is this rate so high?" he said. "Without modern medical intervention such problems often were lethal and this is, from an evolutionary perspective, selection. "Women with a very narrow pelvis would not have survived birth 100 years ago. They do now and pass on their genes encoding for a narrow pelvis to their daughters." Opposing forces It has been a long standing evolutionary question why the human pelvis has not grown wider over the years. The head of a human baby is large compared with other primates, meaning animals such as chimps can give birth relatively easily. The researchers devised a mathematical model using data from the World Health Organization and other large birth studies. They found opposing evolutionary forces in their theoretical study. One is a trend towards larger newborns, which are more healthy. However, if they grow too large, they get stuck during labour, which historically would have proved disastrous for mother and baby, and their genes would not be passed on. "One side of this selective force - namely the trend towards smaller babies - has vanished due to Caesarean sections," said Dr Mitteroecker. "Our intent is not to criticise medical intervention," he said. "But it's had an evolutionary effect. " Future trends The researchers estimated that the global rate of cases where the baby could not fit through the maternal birth canal was 3%, or 30 in 1,000 births. Over the past 50 or 60 years, this rate has increased to about 3.3-3.6%, so up to 36 in 1,000 births. That is about a 10-20% increase of the original rate, due to the evolutionary effect. "The pressing question is what's going to happen in the future?" Dr Mitteroecker said. "I expect that this evolutionary trend will continue but perhaps only slightly and slowly. "There are limits to that. So I don't expect that one day the majority of children will have to be born by [Caesarean] sections." The research is published in the journal, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Commenting on the study, Smithsonian paleoanthropologist Dr Briana Pobiner said there are "probably many other biological and cultural issues that factor into the Caesarean sections rate, which varies widely across the developed and developing world". And Daghni Rajasingam, a consultant obstetrician and a spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians, said factors such as diabetes and obesity, are having an impact on the number of Caesarean sections. "I think what is important to take into the [question of] evolution is that things like diabetes are much more common at a younger age so we see many more women of reproductive age who have diabetes," she said. "That has consequences as to whether or not they may need a caesarean section. "In addition, the rates of obesity are increasing so more and more women of reproductive age have a higher body mass index and this again has an impact on caesarean section rates."

It follows the sudden closure of 20 US embassies and consulates on Sunday. This was prompted by intercepted conversations between two senior al-Qaeda figures, including top leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, US media said. The Pentagon said the US Air Force was flying workers out of the capital, Sanaa, on Tuesday morning. A global travel alert said: "The US Department of State warns US citizens of the high security threat level in Yemen due to terrorist activities and civil unrest. "The department urges US citizens to defer travel to Yemen and those US citizens currently living in Yemen to depart immediately." It added that "the security threat level in Yemen is extremely high". It comes hours after a drone strike killed four suspected al-Qaeda militants in the country overnight, a senior US official has confirmed to the BBC. In a separate incident, tribesmen say they have shot down a Yemeni military helicopter, killing at least six troops. The BBC's Abdullah Ghorab, in Sanaa, says the Yemeni capital has been experiencing unprecedented security measures, with hundreds of armoured vehicles deployed. Our correspondent says a security source confirmed that Yemeni intelligence services had discovered that dozens of al-Qaeda members had arrived in Sanaa over the past few days in preparation for the implementation of a large plot. The source described the plot as dangerous, and suggested it was to include explosions and suicide attacks aimed at Western diplomatic missions and Yemeni military headquarters. A source in the Yemeni air force has told the BBC that Yemeni war planes have made regular flights to monitor movements of cells believed to belong to al-Qaeda in the areas of Shaouan and Thahban in Sanaa. Jail breaks Both the White House and the US state department have said the current threat comes from al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), but have refused to divulge further details. According to the New York Times, the US intercepted communications between Zawahiri and the group's head in Yemen, Nasser al-Wuhayshi. The paper said the conversation represented one of the most serious plots since the 9/11 attacks. Washington earlier said the closures in North Africa and the Middle East were "out of an abundance of caution". A number of US diplomatic posts in the region - including in Sanaa - will remain closed until Saturday. In a statement on its website, the UK Foreign Office said: "Due to increased security concerns, all staff in the British embassy have been temporarily withdrawn and the embassy will remain closed until staff are able to return." It advises against all travel to the country. Several European countries have also temporarily shut missions in Yemen. Officials have advised particular vigilance during the festival period surrounding Eid - the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan - warning that "tensions could be heightened". Eid will begin on Wednesday or Thursday, depending on the sighting of the new moon. Meanwhile, Interpol issued a separate global security alert at the weekend, citing jail breaks linked to al-Qaeda in nine countries. The international policing organisation said "hundreds of terrorists" had been freed during breakouts in countries including Iraq, Libya and Pakistan in the past month. A US state department global travel alert, issued last week, is also in force until the end of August. AQAP, the Yemeni branch of al-Qaeda, has also been blamed for the foiled Christmas Day 2009 effort to bomb an airliner over Detroit and for explosives-laden parcels that were intercepted the following year aboard cargo flights.
New designs of Huawei smartphones are set to lose access to some Google apps. The move comes after the Trump administration added Huawei to a list of companies that American firms cannot trade with unless they have a licence. Google said it was "complying with the order and reviewing the implications". Huawei said it would continue to provide security updates and after-sales services to all existing Huawei and Honor smartphone and tablet products, covering those that have been sold or are still in stock globally. "We will continue to build a safe and sustainable software ecosystem, in order to provide the best experience for all users globally," it added. In a press briefing, China said it "supports the relevant company [Huawei] to defend its legitimate rights according to law". What does this mean for Huawei users? Existing Huawei smartphone users will be able to update apps and push through security fixes, as well as update Google Play services. But when Google launches the next version of Android later this year, it may not be available on Huawei devices. Future Huawei devices may no longer have apps such as YouTube and Maps. Huawei can still use the version of the Android operating system available through an open source licence. Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy, said the move by Google would have "big implications for Huawei's consumer business". UK mobile trade body Mobile UK said it was "working closely with relevant authorities to understand the implications of the US Department of Commerce's placement of Huawei on its Entity List." What can Huawei do about this? Last Wednesday, the Trump administration added Huawei to its "entity list", which bans the company from acquiring technology from US firms without government approval. In his first comments since the firm was placed on the list, Huawei chief executive Ren Zhengfei told Japanese media on Saturday: "We have already been preparing for this." He said the firm, which buys about $67bn (£52.6bn) worth of components each year according to the Nikkei business newspaper, would push ahead with developing its own parts. Huawei faces a growing backlash from Western countries, led by the US, over possible risks posed by using its products in next-generation 5G mobile networks. Several countries have raised concerns that Huawei equipment could be used by China for surveillance, allegations the company has vehemently denied. Huawei has said its work does not pose any threats and that it is independent from the Chinese government. However, some countries have blocked telecoms companies from using Huawei products in 5G mobile networks. So far the UK has held back from any formal ban. "Huawei has been working hard on developing its own App Gallery and other software assets in a similar manner to its work on chipset solutions. There is little doubt these efforts are part of its desire to control its own destiny," said Mr Wood. What are other companies saying? US chipmakers including Intel, Qualcomm and Broadcom are reported to have told their workers they will stop supplying Huawei, according to Bloomberg. Intel would not to comment to the BBC. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Ryan Koontz said Huawei would be "seriously crippled" if it did not have these "key US components", although the Chinese firm is believed to have stockpiles in place. California-based Xilinx said it was aware of the order by the Trump administration and was "co-operating" but had nothing to add. Outside the US, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is continuing to deliver to Huawei. The Nikkei reported that TSMC had said it owned a "complicated and sophisticated export control compliance system" and "based on the data in the system we are not changing our shipping practice for the time being". Short-term damage for Huawei? By Leo Kelion, BBC Technology desk editor In the short term, this could be very damaging for Huawei in the West. Smartphone shoppers would not want an Android phone that lacked access to Google's Play Store, its virtual assistant or security updates, assuming these are among the services that would be pulled. In the longer term, though, this might give smartphone vendors in general a reason to seriously consider the need for a viable alternative to Google's operating system, particularly at a time that the search giant is trying to push its own Pixel brand at their expense. As far as Huawei is concerned, it appears to have prepared for the eventuality of being cut off from American know-how. Its smartphones are already powered by its own proprietary processors, and earlier this year its consumer devices chief told German newspaper Die Welt that "we have prepared our own operating systems - that's our plan B". Even so, this move could knock its ambition to overtake Samsung and become the bestselling smartphone brand in 2020 seriously off course. What about the US-China trade war? The latest move against Huawei marks an escalation in tensions between the firm and the US. The company is facing almost two dozen criminal charges filed by US authorities. Washington is also seeking the extradition of Huawei executive Meng Wangzou from Canada, where she was arrested in December at the behest of American officials. It comes as trade tensions between the US and China also appear to be rising. The world's two largest economies have been locked in a bruising trade battle for the past year that has seen tariffs imposed on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. Earlier this month, Washington more than doubled tariffs on $200bn of Chinese goods, prompting Beijing to retaliate with its own tariff hikes on US products. The move surprised some - and rattled global markets - as the situation had seemed to be nearing a conclusion. The US-China trade war has weighed on the global economy over the past year and created uncertainty for businesses and consumers.
A press release from Spark, the New Zealand company involved, said it had been deemed that the deployment posed "significant security risks" - a polite way of saying that Beijing might use the technology to spy on the country or disrupt its communications in a future dispute. The US and Australia had already closed the door on Huawei's involvement in their next-generation mobile networks. That means three members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance have now acted against the Shenzhen-based company. And one other member, Canada, is carrying out a security review of its own. So, there's a prospect that the UK could soon be the sole holdout, allowing Huawei to play a key role in delivering the data that everything from self-driving cars to smart city sensors will rely on. "There are two factors at play here: 5G will be connected to everything as we go to the internet-of-things," said Ewan Lawson, from UK defence think tank Rusi. "And concerns about foreign-sourced hardware were less intense than they are now." For its part, Huawei has said: "[We are] aware of Spark's statement and we are looking into the situation. "As a leading global supplier of telecoms equipment, we remain committed to developing trusted and secure solutions for our customers." Is the UK just being complacent? The government argues not. "This government and British telecoms operators work with Huawei at home and abroad to ensure the UK can continue to benefit from new technology while managing cyber-security risks," a Cabinet Office spokeswoman told BBC News. That work includes a facility nicknamed the Cell, in Banbury, Oxfordshire, where staff employed by Huawei but answering to GCHQ hunt for security flaws in the company's products. It has not uncovered evidence of hidden backdoors or other deliberate attempts of subterfuge. But its last report did identify shortcomings that led it to warn that it could offer only "limited assurance" that the company posed no threat. The UK government is also thought to have fired a shot across the bows last month, when it wrote to telecoms companies warning that a review of their infrastructure could lead to "changes in the current rules" that should be taken into account during "procurement decisions". Huawei was not mentioned by name, but the Financial Times - which revealed the letter's existence - said some industry executives interpreted it to mean a ban was still possible. But others have their doubts, noting that other political factors are at play. "The letter did go out but the issue remains that in the absence of any definitive evidence of a problem, an unspecific security risk has to be weighed against trade opportunities," said Mr Lawson. "If Huawei was banned, we don't know the extent to which China might well refuse to do business with us in other fields - and the timing for that would not be great with so much attention on the potential economic impacts of Brexit." How strong are Huawei's existing UK ties? Huawei opened its first office in the country in 2001 and soon had its equipment adopted by BT and Vodafone, which used it to support 2G, 3G and 4G mobile services as well as "superfast" fibre and other types of broadband connections to homes and businesses. Its kit includes mobile phone radio antennas and the routers and switches found in kerbside cabinets. Most of the country's mobile networks - Vodafone, EE and Three - are now working with Huawei to prepare their 5G offerings. O2's parent Telefonica has also tested its new equipment elsewhere and signalled that it might use it in the UK. In addition, Huawei says it has developed research and development partnerships with many of the country's leading academic institutions, including the Universities of Cambridge, Oxford, Cardiff and Imperial College. Its UK board of directors includes Lord Browne, the former chief of BP, and Sir Andrew Cahn, a former high-ranking civil servant. Does Huawei pose a real threat? The company is keen to portray itself as a private company owned by its employees with no ties to the Chinese government beyond those of a law-abiding taxpayer. It can also lay claim to being one of the biggest spenders on research and development - it invested more than $13.2bn (£10.3bn) last year and has said the figure will be even higher for 2018. But critics like to point out that its media-shy founder, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the country's army and joined the Communist Party in 1978. Furthermore, they question how free any major Chinese business can be from Beijing's influence. "It's accepted practice in China that relationships between Chinese companies and the state have to be extremely close," said Prof Anthony Glees, director of the Buckingham University Centre for Security and Intelligence Studies. "Many other countries have said no [to Huawei over 5G]. "We've come to the matter late as we have already let them through the door." Another leading cyber-security expert agreed that Huawei could be co-opted into incapacitating the equipment it had sold. "The obvious concern with 5G is whether there is a material risk of the Chinese being in a position to run a big denial-of-service attack on Britain in the event of a time of international tension," said Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge. "There is obviously a risk. China plays hardball and we have been hoping in vain for years that it would get nice as it got richer but that hasn't happened." For now, Beijing has been reticent to be seen to be too forceful in leaping to Huawei's defence. The Chinese government did warn against "protectionism" when a deal to sell Huawei's phones in the US fell through and then "discriminatory practices" when Australia banned local networks using its 5G equipment. But Chinese officials are already preoccupied with President Trump's threats of more trade tariffs and might see any effort to try to help Huawei as likely to backfire. Even so, eyebrows have still been raised by a decision to exclude its founder from a list of 100 key contributors to China's economy over the past 40 years recently published in the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper. Whether that is because Mr Ren is viewed as being too close or not close enough to the government is unclear.
The company's management team says the internet means that pornographic magazines are no longer commercially viable. Playboy's circulation has fallen dramatically from its peak in the mid-1970s. We have been asking what you think of this change; on Twitter, on Facebook and on our story. Many of you think it is a most welcome move and might even help encourage a more respectful portrayal of women in the media. Others think it is simply a smart marketing choice. Some, rather wistfully, see it as the "end of an era". Other people say that without the nudity, it is the beginning of the end of Playboy. One click away However, many others are pointing out that if you want to see naked people, you can just go online. As Playboy's chief executive Scott Flanders put it: "You're now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free." Quite. Maybe there is a bigger problem. Is the magazine itself outdated as a form of media? Playboy's circulation has dropped from 5.6 million in the 1970s to the current 800,000. Finally, some people are simply very happy that a certain well-known trope will now be true.
In a newspaper interview, he hinted again that the bank might soon start a policy of quantitative easing to try to stimulate the eurozone economies. The aim would be to stop the continued fall in the general level of prices. The euro fell 0.4% to $1.2034 after Mr Draghi's comments were made public. Recently, the official eurozone inflation rate has fallen to just 0.3%. 'Making preparations' To stop deflation - falling prices - gaining a grip on the world's largest trading bloc, the ECB could launch its own programme of quantitative easing (QE) by buying government bonds, thus copying its counterparts in the UK and the US. The purpose would be to inject cash into the banking system, stimulate the economy and push prices higher. Speaking in an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt, Mr Draghi said: "We are making technical preparations to alter the size, pace and composition of our measures in early 2015." Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, said: "The comments suggest the ECB will soon adopt sovereign debt QE, which may come as soon as their next meeting.'' If bond prices rose because of this extra demand from the central bank, the yield available to bond investors would fall, with the knock-on effect of reducing the general level of interest rates in the eurozone banking system. And it is that prospect which has helped to weaken the value of the euro on the foreign exchanges. Many hints Although the ECB has already cut interest rates to a record low level, and also bought some bonds issued by private companies, a full-scale programme of QE has not yet been launched. But it has been on the cards since April 2014, when Mr Draghi made the first of a series of comments suggesting that he might trigger such a policy in due course. "It [the euro] could break below $1.20 since there is a risk of a very low inflation reading out of the euro zone next week," said Niels Christensen, an FX strategist at Nordea. "That will just add to pressure on the ECB to take measures when it meets later this month." The next ECB policy meeting will be on 22 January. Eurozone concerns Consumer inflation has not been at the ECB's target level of just below 2% since the start of 2013, and has been falling since a 3% peak late in 2011. The eurozone's low inflation has been blamed for undermining growth, and has already prompted ECB stimulus measures. In September, the bank said it would begin buying covered bonds, which are bonds backed by public sector loans or mortgages. In December Mr Draghi said ECB staff "have stepped up the technical preparations for further measures, which could, if needed, be implemented in a timely manner." Traders have a number of eurozone concerns going into 2015, including the outcome of a snap election in Greece on 25 January. The left-wing Syriza coalition is ahead in opinion polls and rejects EU austerity measures, which have been blamed for soaring unemployment and a rise in poverty in the country. There are doubts about Greece's future in the eurozone should it fail to stick with its agreed austerity programme. Analysis: Andrew Walker, economics correspondent, BBC World Service Mr Draghi's remarks are yet another signal that full-scale quantitative easing in the eurozone is probably coming. It could be less than three weeks away. The ECB's first major policy meeting of the year is on 22 January. Another clue to the ECB's likely actions comes next week, when we get a first estimate for eurozone inflation in December. The previous month's figure was 0.3%. Anything lower would reinforce the odds of early action by the ECB. And there are plenty of reasons to think inflation might be lower. There is the continued decline in global oil prices, and new business survey data suggesting the eurozone is still weak. We have also had figures for Spain in December showing prices falling more rapidly than before.
By Emily McAuliffeBusiness reporter, Melbourne, Australia "The atmosphere is usually one of enthusiasm, excitement, anticipation and curiosity," he says. If you asked people to try to picture hunting for truffles, the expensive subterranean fungi, many would no doubt imagine men with dogs going through woodlands in France or Italy. Given that truffles have been harvested in both countries for centuries, this is understandable. Yet since 1999 they have been joined by Australia, which in just 20 years has become the world's fourth-largest producer of the most-prized type of black truffle - the French black or périgord. Some in the Australian industry, such as Mr Wood, the owner of Truffle Paddock, a truffle farm in the state of Victoria, even believe that in another decade's time the country could take the number one position. While exact country-by-country figures are difficult to come by, given the secrecy that surrounds the "diamonds in the dirt", Australia is expected to harvest between 14 and 18 tonnes of French blacks this year. This compares with an estimated 60 tonnes last winter in Spain, 30 tonnes in Italy, and slightly more than Australia in France. (Industry experts say it is notoriously difficult to quantify French production figures due to a lack of data, and accusations that it imports périgords from Spain that then become "French".) What is not in doubt is that selling fresh French blacks is a very lucrative business. Much in demand in the world's finest restaurants, they can retail for up to $1,300 (£1,000) a kg. Not native to Australia, they were first introduced to the country in the mid 1990s, with the first Australian truffles unearthed in 1999. To cultivate or farm the truffles, trees - typically oak and hazelnut saplings - are replanted after their roots have been inoculated with the fungus' spores. Then five to eight years later you can start to harvest the resulting black truffles. As périgord truffles are harvested in the autumn and winter, the season in Australia runs from May until mid August. Geoff Barrett, co-founder and managing director of Oak Valley Truffles in Western Australia, says this gives the country's producers a huge advantage because they are selling their crop when they are none available from Europe. "Australia's truffle industry is doing so well because we don't have any competitors," he says. "We produce truffles in the southern hemisphere when there are none in the northern hemisphere." Given that fresh truffles only have a shelf life of two weeks, it means that thanks to Australia's crop, chefs in the northern hemisphere can now sell dishes including the priced ingredient in their spring and summer. "We export to 31 countries, and don't have the supply by even half to match the demand from overseas," says Alex Wilson, head of sales at The Truffle & Wine Co - Australia's first commercial truffle farm or truffière, and the single largest producer of black truffles in the southern hemisphere. "We export around 85% of our truffles and I pre-sell the whole crop," he says. Truffle & Wine Co is so bullish about the industry's growth that it has ripped up around 80% of its former vineyards in Western Australia to allow expansion of the truffière. While Western Australia, and more specifically, the town of Manjimup, produces the lion's share of Australia's périgord truffles - there are now 300 farms scattered across the country, and this number is expected to grow. Colin Carter, vice president of the Australian Truffle Growers Association, says that his members are well versed on how to produce good crops, such as adding limestone to their soils to reach the desired alkaline levels. Mr Wilson says this knowhow means that the industry in Australia is "leaps and bounds ahead" of more recent efforts to farm truffles in South Africa, and countries in South America. "Australia has a multi-tonne commercial industry, while places such as South Africa are still finding their feet," he adds. Alongside Australia's successful exports, a small domestic market is also developing. While truffles have long been a menu staple in Europe, the delicate fungus is a more recent addition to Australia's gastronomy scene, so part of the challenge for local growers has been around education and raising the profile of truffles. "If you mentioned truffles to someone in Australia 20 years ago, most would have assumed you were talking about a chocolate," says Barrett. "Now I'd say 95% of people know what a truffle is, and many are inquisitive as to how they're grown and used." Global Trade More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: French-born chef Philippe Mouchel says he's noticed greater consumer awareness of truffles at his namesake restaurant in Melbourne's central business district. "During the Australian season we use fresh black truffles across much of our menu and people ask for it," he says. "If you look around Melbourne, everyone is doing truffle degustation dinners throughout winter and they're so popular they sell out. "There are more and more truffles around, chefs want to work with them and people want to enjoy them." To help continue to raise this awareness, Mr Wood of Truffle Paddock, helps to organise an annual truffle festival in Melbourne. And back on his truffle farm he has just spent the autumn and winter welcoming visitors to join him and his dogs hunting for the precious crop. "On most hunts, guests are invited to smell the truffle in the earth before it's harvested, and sometimes get to dig out the truffle," he says. "People really enjoy that part and often want to buy the truffle they harvested to take home, share, and most likely brag about." Regarding the wider industry in the country, he says: "There is good reason to think that Australia could become the world's largest producer of black truffles within the decade. "Some Western Australia estimates suggest that in 10 years their production will quadruple, as many newer and very large and medium-sized farms come into production. And although the east coast is usually characterised by small to medium-sized farms, more recently some large farms have also been established."
The firm told the Financial Times it would bring the augmented reality game to China after striking a partnership deal with a local company NetEase. Chinese regulations covering online content demand that foreign firms find a partner to launch digital ventures in the country. Niantic gave no specific date for when Pokemon Go would be turned on in China. Competition time John Hanke, chief executive of the US firm, told the FT that it "absolutely" intended to take its games to China - the worlds largest mobile market. The 2016 launch of Pokemon Go and its massive popularity had left the company cash rich, he said, and in a good position to expand. Also, he added, a recent funding round had raised $200m (£148m) from investors that would also fuel expansion. The Pokemon game involves players using their smartphones to find and catch the game's titular monsters in the real world. They then use the captive creatures to battle other players. Augmented reality (AR) technology inserts the monsters when people view the world through their phone's camera. Player numbers had dwindled sharply since Pokemon's launch, said Mr Hanke, but there was a "solid" core of players who had stuck with the game. The technical and policy expertise Niantic had amassed while launching Pokemon Go would serve it well as it developed more games, he said. The next big game it plans to launch will be based around the hugely popular Harry Potter series of stories. That game had the potential to appeal to a very wide range of people, he said. The game is due to be released in the second half of 2018. Niantic could face increased competition in 2018 from Google, Apple, Facebook and Snap all of whom have released AR toolkits for developers. Additionally, in China online retail giant Alibaba has announced plans to use AR to help commercial partners.
